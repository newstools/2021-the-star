Serie ‘A’ clubs agreed on Wednesday to postpone until next week a vote on pay TV operator Sky’s bid for screening three out of 10 games on a non-exclusive basis, Italian top league said in a statement. The postponement comes after Sky, owned by U.S. group Comcast, requested a judge to block the sale of Serie A’s main domestic rights package to sport streaming service DAZN, saying the process was not compliant with Italian laws aimed at protecting competition. A decision on the case is expected in a few days, a legal source familiar with the matter said after a closed door hearing on Wednesday. In March, Serie ‘A’ awarded DAZN the rights to screen all Serie ‘A’ matches for 2.5 billion euros in the 2021-24 period in Italy, including exclusive rights for seven out of 10 games per matchday. Sky’s proposal was broadly in line with a previous offer which was rejected by Serie ‘A’, worth some 263 million euros, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Under the current three-year agreement, expiring in June, Serie ‘A’ raised about 2.9 billion euros from Sky and DAZN, with Sky holding the lion’s share of the rights.
