Tennis Kenya will host the Confederation of Africa Tennis (CAT) Under-14 tournament from June 4-6 at the Nairobi Club. This will be the federation's first event since the suspension of sports in the country by President Uhuru Kenyatta three weeks ago. TK administrator Nancy Nduku said players, who will reach quarter-finals will earn ranking points . The entry fee is Sh2000 for each player and Nduku said she expects a competitive tournament with players drawn from South Africa, Egypt, Morocco,  Uganda and  Tunisia. "We expect top players from all over Africa to honour the event hence the event promises thrills," she added. The Kenya team will have the likes of Alicia Owegi, Rosehilda Asumwa, Derrick Ominde and Shakira Varese among others with entries expected to close this Wednesday. Elsewhere, TK  will be banking on wildcards to compete in the wheelchair Tokyo Paralympics and World Cup later this year. The wheelchair side is fresh from Africa World tennis qualifiers in Portugal 10 days ago, where the top four sides qualified for the Summer Games and World Cup slated for October. The women’s team that included Jane Ndenga, Phoebe Masika and Asiya Sururu finished seventh while the men's team of Collins Omondi, Asman Rajab, Peter Munuve and Warioba Matano finished sixth. Ndenga said they have applied and were hopeful of getting wildcards for the two events. Ndenga is hopeful Kenya will attend a futures event in Croatia and South Africa next month and September. She said the closure of sports activities in March really hampered their chance in Portugal. “We struggled because of lack of opportunities to play during the restrictions but we hope in the next two to three months we will not be closed down," she added. This will be the first time the women's team will miss out after featuring in the 2014, 2017 and 2018 editions since the inception of the sport in 2012 in Kenya.
