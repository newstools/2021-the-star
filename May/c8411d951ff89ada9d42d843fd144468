Organisers and attendees of night-long dances at funerals risk arrest and prosecution, county police commander Amrose Steve Oloo has warnined. The officer said the trend of night mourning events and wedding ceremonies is back in the region despite a ban by the national government. Kinango and Matuga subcounties were mentioned to be the most notorious. Oloo said people take advantage of the region's remoteness to conduct the discos. The disco matangas were banned mainly to enforce the Covid-19 regulations and curb rape cases, insecurity and teen pregnancies. Oloo said the ban is still effective and threatened to confiscate all the music equipment and take stringent actions on people championing the forbidden disco events. "We will arrest anyone going against the government orders. The curfew is there and all the Ministry of Health protocols must be followed. As police officers, we shall enforce," he said. The disco matangas and night weddings in Kwale have for long wreaked havoc among the teenage girls. They have been frequently blamed for education underperformance and the increasing teen marriages and pregnancies that ruin the future of many bright girls. Recently, a human rights organization, Human Development Agenda, raised the alarm over the re-emergence of incidents of teen pregnancies. HUDA officer Kashi Jermaine said at 10-15 cases were reported each month. The majority are from Lunga Lunga and Msambweni constituencies with some scattered in other subcounties. Last year the teen pregnancies were reported to have reduced by 70 per cent. But the cases remained relatively high as over 2,800 had been recorded by September. Oloo said the government won't tire in the fight against Covid-19 and teen pregnancies. He said all those who will defy the ban shall have it rough with the law. The officer said police won't allow a few people to risk the lives of many and endanger children's future. Edited by Henry Makori
