The Confederation of African Football (CAF) Emergency Committee has resolved to postponed the FIFA World Cup African Qualifier matches following the challenges that have been caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement on Thursday, the committee said that the matches that were set to be played in June this year will now take place in the existing windows of September, October, and November 2021 and on March 2022. “The CAF Emergency Committee in consultation with FIFA decided to postpone the CAF qualifiers for FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022…after taking into consideration the current challenges cause by the Covid-19 pandemic,” part of the committee’s statement reads. CAF has also said that it is reassessing its protocols and processes to enhance the implementation of Covid related protocols, including specifically focusing on pre-match testing, which it said has been the source of some challenges faced in the previous windows. Full detail on the updated match schedule will be provided in due course.
