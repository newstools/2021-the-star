Angry students of St Paul’s Diploma Teachers Training College in Bumula constituency, Bungoma county, on Monday took to the streets to protest the killing of a third-year colleague. The students say the body of their colleague was discovered along the railway line, a few metres from the college, on Sunday night. Martin Ambani, a student of Geography and Kiswahili, was to graduate this year after the completion of his diploma course. The students blocked the Bungoma-Malaba highway at Kimaeti for almost one hour. They appealed to Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to find a lasting solution to the insecurity in the area, saying students were most affected. The students, led by Patrick Kemei, blamed the murder on laxity and failure to strengthen security around the college. “This is not the first student to be murdered in such unclear circumstances. If this situation is not going to be addressed, then this college should be closed,” Kemei said. Kemei, also a third-year student, said villagers have been sneaking into the institution at night and stealing students’ clothes, phones and other valuables. “Since we were relocated to Syombe, insecurity and theft cases have been on the rise in our institution and I appeal to relevant authorities to make sure that we are safe while here," he said. Bungoma police commander Mutungi Mutiso confirmed the incident and asked students to remain calm as investigations continue. “I appeal to relatives and students to remain calm, demonstrations will not add value, we have lost a life. We should let the investigations be completed so that justice can be dispensed," Mutiso said. College principal Saul Barasa declined to comment on the matter, saying police officers were probing the murder. St Paul’s Diploma Teachers Training College was previously located in Kibabii area in Kanduyi constituency before it was relocated to Syombe in Bumula.  Edited by A.N
