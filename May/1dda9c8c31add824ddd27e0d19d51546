US-based Edward Cheserek says he is ready to battle other seasoned athletes in the men's 10,000m for a chance to represent the country at the Tokyo Olympics. World half marathon record holder Kibiwott Kandie, national cross country defending champion Rodgers Kwemoi and Bedan Karoki, among others, are among elite names hoping to do duty for Kenya in the race at the Olympics. However, Cheserek believes he is on the path to realising his Olympic dream, judging by his performances. "So far, so good. I am hopeful of stating my case emphatically thanks to the training and performances I have produced. After here, I will resume my training for the next three weeks before the trials and am sure I will only get better and fitter in time for the event," Cheserek said. The Arizona-based athlete clocked 28:10.41 to win Heat 1 of the Men's 10,000m race during the Tokyo Olympics pre-trials on Friday afternoon at the Nyayo Stadium, Nairobi. Collins Koros — fresh from winning the men's 10,000m at the KDF Athletics Championships last week — finished second in 28:13.38 whereas Hillary Mosop came third in  28:42.23. Cheserek, who has been training at Kaptagat for the past three months, however, noted that the hot weather stretched his abilities to the limit. "The race was good although I was not expecting it to be this hot. I had to try my best, regardless, and am happy that it bore fruits. I will be back here (Nairobi) in the next three weeks for the trials. Training has worked out well so far," he said. In other finals staged on day two of the championships, Sharon Lodeki, another US-based athlete, timed 31:43.34 to win the women's 10,000m ahead of Sandra Felis Chebet (31:47.29) and Nancy Jelegat ( 31:49.93). In the women's 200m, Maureen Thomas stormed to victory in 23.69 whereas Monica Safani (24.73) and Evangeline Makena (24.92) finished second and third respectively. Peter Mwai claimed first place in the men's 200m, timing 20:85 ahead of Samuel Chege (20.99) and Elijah Matthew ( 21.07) in second and third.
