Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu is in Kenya for a two-day official visit following the invitation from her host President Uhuru Kenyatta. Suluhu arrived in the country on Tuesday morning and was welcomed at the JKIA by Kenyan Foreign CS Raychelle Omamo and Sports CS Amina Mohammed. Suluhu visited Jomo Kenyatta's mausoleum next to Parliament. Suluhu was earlier received at State House Nairobi by Uhuru where she was accorded a 21-gun salute before inspecting a guard of honour. The leaders embarked on a wider discussion at the State House involving the delegates from the two countries. Suluhu is expected to address a joint special sitting of both the Senate and the National Assembly on Wednesday. Only 112 of the 416 MPs will sit in the National Assembly chamber for the address by visiting Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu. Speaker Justin Muturi said the seats have been reserved for 24 Senators and 88 members of the National Assembly on a first-come-first-served basis. MPs were further directed to remove their vehicles from the parking yard near the Senate entrance to pave way for Suluhuâ€™s reception. PHOTOS TAKEN BY FREDRICK OMONDI ON MAY 4 2021.
