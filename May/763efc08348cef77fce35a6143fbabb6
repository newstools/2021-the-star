Kenya Airports Authority is yet to fill the Managing Director's post close to two years after former chief executive Jonny Andersen. The authority on Tuesday re-advertised the top position seemingly after earlier interviews failed to yield the desired candidate. A source at the parent  Transport ministry told the Star some interviews took place recently and among those interviewed were the acting MD Alex Gitari, GM Marketing  Jimmy Kibati and a secretary to the Transport Cabinet Secretary. Gitari has been acting since  October 2019. The interviews were conducted on March 17 2021 by audit and accountancy firm Delloite and KAA 15 months after the initial recruitment process commenced. KAA chairman Isaac Awuondo yesterday declined  to comment on the matter. “What is in the advert is what is there , I have nothing more to say on the matter,” said Awuondo. The recruitment process for a new CEO and MD commenced in October 2019. The top position at the Authority has not had a substantial placement for the past 21 months since Andersen, quit in August 2019 citing personal reasons. Insiders however said he was edged out for opposing the the planned merger of KAA and Kenya Airways operations . The Norwegian was at the helm of KAA from November 2016, replacing acting managing director Yatich Kangugo. Prior to joining the authority, he worked with Avinor AS in Norway where he was the national airports director. In the fresh call for applicants, KAA says those who believe they meet the relevant criteria to apply not later than May 21 2021. Those who had applied for the role nearly two years ago have also been encouraged to re-apply. KAA’s next Managing Director will be on  a three year contract.
