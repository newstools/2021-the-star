A section of Wajir leaders has rubbished claims of political power play and wich-hunt in the impeachment of former governor Mohammed Abdi. Led by Eldas MP Adan Keynan and newly sworn governor Ahmed Muktar, the leader said Abdi's ouster was driven by alleged lack of development and services to the residents by the ex-governors administration. This even as they told off the Council of Governors that is planning to challenge Abdi's removal to respect the decision of the Senate, county assembly and cries of the residents. They include MPs, MCAs from the county and Environment CAS Mohammed Elmi. Muktar said the county government headed by Abdi stiffled development with residents crying for basic services including the crucial health services. "There have been very many serious issues in Wajir. Hospitals were closed. Health workers were not at work. We faced some very small issues that any county government can handle," Muktar said. They addressed a press conference at a hotel in Nairobi on Tuesday. Abdi was impeached last Monday for gross violation of the constitution and other laws. The senate committee chaired by Nyamira senator Okong'o Omogeni had found the governor culpable of running down the health care system in the county thus compromising the right to health of the residents. However, Abdi dismissed as unsubstantiated allegations levelled against him by the county assembly. Abdi said the case is politically instigated with malice and is a witch hunt, urging the committee to dismiss the allegations.
