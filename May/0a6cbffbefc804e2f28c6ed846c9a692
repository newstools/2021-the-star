We entered early to spend the entire day in the park just enjoying creation, from the smallest to the largest creatures. Well, I have to say it was an amazing day. We saw wonderful and very interesting sightings and observations of so many different varieties of species. These ranged from insects to birds to smaller reptilian creatures to small and large mammals. After a few hours, we stopped again to watch some interesting interactions after the rain as many birds were enjoying eating flying ants. Another vehicle stopped next to us and straight away, the driver asked me rather bluntly, “Where are the lions?” Well, my answer was rather flat as I informed the driver that we were “just watching some birds”. Then I thought to myself, “If only people visiting the park would rather focus on experiencing the wonders of every creation that is found within the park!“ Such an attitude always has the greatest rewards. In my personal experience, I have been on over 4,600 game drives in the Nairobi National Park, and I have never ever been bored. Each visit simply reminds me of how little I actually know about the incredible creation that God has put on earth. The Nairobi National Park is awesome in that such a relatively small 117sq km area has so much more natural flora and fauna than most people realize. Indeed, a true priceless treasure, right next to a major city. The tranquil peace in the park is tangible and very real. A day in the park is a real “soul tonic” medicine for the inner being, an escape from the fast-paced world around us. Who knows what you might see? Perhaps as you enjoy the many wonderful creatures and plants, some predators like lions might just ”get in your way!” For information link to the following websites www.kws.go.ke
