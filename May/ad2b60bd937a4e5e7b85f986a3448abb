US-based Kenyan artiste Msanii Foreman is in the country for charity programmes and to market his music. Speaking to Word Is, Msanii said he has featured locally in several gender-driven charity and FGM awareness campaigns in the past decade. "There is just something special about being back home in Kenya. I feel excited with my team about an array of fulfilling charity causes we'll be carrying out in Kenya," he said. "Music has always had a special place in my heart, and when you're able to share it with others, especially those who need it and can appreciate it the most, it assures me my music is 100 times more powerful." He is an established composer, artiste and performer based in Arizona, USA. Among his latest releases is 'Cherie'.
