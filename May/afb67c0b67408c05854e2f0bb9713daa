Residents of Garissa living near the border with Isiolo have asked the national government to lead efforts to end the protracted boundary clashes to save lives and property. Residents led by Danyere MCA Daud Adan said interventions by local leadership had borne no fruit and called on the national government to take up the matter. “The conflict between the two communities along the Isiolo and Garissa county border continues to escalate. We are calling on the national government to intervene and solve this matter for once and for all,” Adan told journalists on Saturday. The residents want all the local political and security leaders from both counties to call for a peace dialogue meeting to solve the border dispute. “We are tired of living in constant fear. The people we have lost and property due to these conflicts should be the last. We want peace to be restored in this area once and for all,” youth leader Hussein Dawane said. “It is unfortunate and sad that every time there has been a bandit attack, it is Garissa side that has been blamed yet we are the victims,” he said. County religious affairs representative Ahmed Bilal urged the warring neighbours to embrace peace as part of their Islamic virtues. “A majority of the people in Garissa and Isiolo are Muslims. Islam is for peace, let everyone calm down and allow the security machinery to resolve these issues,” Bilal said. Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti has also called on the national security agencies and leaders to avert further bloodshed.
