Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula has urged the Building Bridges Initiative proponents to respect the court ruling and stop bashing judges. He said courts are constitutional bodies that have to be respected and those who do not agree with the ruling should seek redress through an appeal. “Now that the judges have said what they have said, my advice to my brothers in leadership is not to insult and condemn the judges. Look at what they have said and remember our courts give room for appeal,” Wetang'ula said. He said that was the only lawful and constitutional way of dealing with such issues. “This is the only way Kenya will remain a country founded on the rule of law, constitutionalism and respect for institutions and each other,” Wetang'ula said. He spoke in Namilama village in Kabuchai. A cross-section of BBI proponents have been attacking the five-judge bench for what they have termed 'an activist judgment'. This is after the High Court on Thursday declared the entire BBI process unconstitutional, null and void. The senator warned leaders against degenerating into name-calling, adding that such earth-shaking judgments are expected to annoy some people, rattle some and settle others. Kimili MP Didmus Barasa said the BBI would not bring solutions to the problems in the country. “I told you this BBI will not solve the problems facing Kenya, and now I am vindicated,” he said. The MP said President Uhuru Kenya and ODM leader Raila Odinga should not appeal the ruling. “They should actually abandon the journey after the ruling and concentrate on improving the ailing economy of this country,” he said.
