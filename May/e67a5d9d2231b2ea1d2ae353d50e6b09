Barcelona vs Atleti Saturday 5:15 pm The Spanish La Liga title will be at stake when Barcelona and Atletico Madrid face off at Camp Nou on Saturday. The Catalan giants came from behind to beat Valencia last weekend to revive their title hopes. Captain Lionel Messi scored a brace in the triumph, and we are positive that the Argentine superstar is going to prove a handful for the opposition defenders. With Atletico scoring two+ goals in two of the last three head-to-heads, there’s the real chance that could happen too, although with their first La Liga title since 2013/14 within sight, the visitors’ may foster a cagey affair. During their last title-win run-up, that season saw Atletico register a 1-1 draw at Barcelona in May, a result the visitors may take again considering they’ve won just one of their previous six competitive road trips after scoring the opener just twice.

That puts the 2020/21 whipping boys on course for 19 points, making them the sixth Premier League team to ever finish with under 20 points. A victory here will see them win their first Premier League home game for the fourth time within a possible five such matches in 2021. Sheffield’s last two home league wins have ended 1-0, courtesy of goals inside the opening 30 minutes. Crystal Palace need to arrest a rut of their own if they want to have any chance of a top-half finish. Palace are still without a clean sheet away win since June 2020 and their last three away victories have seen the first two match goals shared. The same attribute applies to the first two match goals scored in each of Palace’s last seven away games to see both teams score.

They have won only twice across their last 13 league outings and have conceded the first-half opener in all five losses during that run. Genoa are now unbeaten in 11 Serie ‘A’ home matches for the first time since February 2008. There are other positives here too as the hosts are yet to lose a Serie ‘A’ game on home soil when netting the opener this campaign, in which five of the opening goals arrived inside the first 15 minutes. Unbeaten in five Serie ‘A’ matches for the first time since November 2020 and with Roma faltering above them in the table, Sassuolo are making a late push for European football next season. After holding high-flying Atalanta to a 1-1 draw last time out, they have now scored their last seven Serie ‘A’ goals after halftime. Despite that though, the visitors have been vulnerable in the early stages conceding the opener in seven Serie ‘A’ away matches. There is a big value in both teams to scoring in this match-up.
