The KCSE class of 2020 will this week know the universities they will join. The Star has established universities that have declared 147,000 places, making available more places than the number of candidates who made the cut for degree slots. Vacancies are spread across 500-degree programmes in public and private universities. All candidates who scored C+ and above proceed to universities. A total of 747,161 sat the test, with 143,140 candidates making the cut-off mark of C+ (plus) and above and are eligible for government sponsorship. In technical colleges, over 100,000 slots have been identified for placement for diploma and certificate courses. The placement comes at a unique time the sector is facing uncertainty over shutdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Education CS George Magoha asked universities to contact the new students, give them joining instructions and fast-track the start of their academic journey. Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement service will place all those with C+ (plus) and above to universities to pursue degree courses. Magoha said admission to universities will not be affected. This means the students will join the respective institutions in September.
