The importance of planting trees must be instilled in learners from a young age to help them appreciate the value of a good environment, Equity Bank chief commercial officer Polycarp Igathe has said. Igathe on Saturday said this is one of the ways that will help the government achieve its target of 10 per cent forest cover in Kenya by 2030. Speaking at Marimani Secondary School after joining students, the community and other stakeholders in planting 2,000 trees, Igathe said mother nature always repays. “Kenya is the home of Wangari Mathai, the great Nobel Peace Laureate. A woman who taught us the importance of trees through her work,” Igathe said. “Trees absorb our waste and then they give us the oxygen we need. With trees, we can regenerate our land and our community.” So far, Equity Bank has planted 1.8 million trees across the country. In Mombasa, the bank plans to plant 300,000 trees this season. Mombasa Deputy Governor William Kingi said Mombasa is also working towards helping the government achieve its target. “Mombasa is targeting to plant a million trees every year to help achieve the government’s target of 10 per cent forest cover by 2030,” he said. The country’s forest cover currently stands at 7.4 per cent. Igathe and Kingi said trees must be well taken care of for the country to succeed. Every Saturday, Equity has been planting trees in different parts of the country. Last week, the team was at Pwani University. “Equity bank believes in energy and environment, food and agriculture and we are working towards ensuring the sustainability of these sectors,”  Igathe said. He said they have been partnering mostly with educational institutions including universities, secondary and primary schools so that young people can understand the importance of trees.
