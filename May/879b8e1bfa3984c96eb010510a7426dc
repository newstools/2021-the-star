Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu has called on the newly admitted advocates to be honest when dealing with their clients to promote public confidence in the justice system. Mwilu spoke during the admission of 191 advocates at Supreme Court building, Nairobi yesterday. She asked the advocates to be conscious of their conduct and etiquette. “Always be honest, respectable and civil in all your interactions as an advocate and as a person. Be honest with your clients and all those whom you give counsel; for it is your responsibility and duty to promote public confidence in the entire edifice of justice,” she said. Mwilu further advised the advocates to confront any challenges they may face along the way deliberately and without caginess. “The challenges that your generation faces today are not the same as those I faced when I joined the profession. We are currently within the ravages of a vicious pandemic, which has only exacerbated economic hardships and made even tougher, what was a tough job market and practice environment. But we too faced significant challenges then, and continue to do so now,” she said. She called on advocates to equip themselves with the skills and abilities to deal with the trials and tribulations they will face in their line of duty. “The experiences of your senior colleagues on the Bar are invaluable in this regard, and you must make the most of and learn from them. But beyond experiences, you must be adaptable, innovative and conscious of the evolving terrain, nationally, regionally and globally, within which the law is practiced,” said Mwilu. -Edited by SKanyara
