Students living with HIV in Homa Bay county have been asked to take antiretroviral drugs before they report back to school next week. Homa Bay Health executive Richard Muga said many students in boarding schools find it difficult to access health facilities for the drugs once learning begins. “We’re making plans to give students ARVs that can be used for two months,” Muga said. Homa Bay has 11,355 adolescent students who are living with HIV. The group will take the drugs on Saturday. Meanwhile, hundreds of people living with HIV in Homa Bay have begun receiving ARVs after an acute shortage of the drugs. The two-months shortage was caused by a stalemate between the Kenyan government and USAID over the distribution to counties of donated drugs. Homa Bay, which ranks first on HIV prevalence with 19.6 per cent, received a consignment of ARV drugs that can last for a month. Deputy Aids & STIs coordinator Justus Ocholla said the drugs were delivered on Monday. “I can’t quantify the number of drugs delivered but what I know is that distribution is ongoing at different health facilities across the county,” Ocholla said. At Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital on Wednesday, some people were already receiving the drugs. A pharmacist at the hospital said the facility serves more than 8,500 people. The current stock is 1,800 bottles of ARVs. The pharmacist said that some drugs have been taken to other satellite facilities which had placed requests after they ran out of stock. He said they are coordinating with the centres to ensure no registered patient is left out. “The quantity of drugs we received is below what we requested. The drugs we’re giving will last them for about three weeks,” the health worker said. The medic asked not to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media.  (edited by o. owino)
