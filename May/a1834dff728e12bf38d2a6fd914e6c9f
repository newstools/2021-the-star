Sammy Leshore has been gazetted as Isaac Mwaura's replacement as nominated senator. Leshore is a former Samburu senator. The embattled legislator obtained a court order stopping Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka from declaring his seat vacant. On Tuesday evening, a court stayed his removal pending the hearing and determination of his appeal. The case is slated for hearing on May 24. Milimani Law Court judge J.K Sergon issued an injunction restraining implementation of the judgement of the Political Parties Tribunal that was issued on May 7, 2021, until the case is heard and determined. Mwaura had suffered a major setback after the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal endorsed a decision by the Jubilee Party to expel him on the grounds of disloyalty and pledging allegiance to another outfit. Mwaura was the first casualty after President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s purge of disloyalists from the ruling Jubilee Party. Mwaura is a two-time nominated lawmaker. He had switched camp from Uhuru's to Deputy President William Ruto's and criticised the rule by political dynasties. "Let me ask you, the family of [former President Daniel] Moi ruled us for 24 years. The [first President Jomo] Kenyatta family ruled for 15 years and another 10 is ending. That's 50 years," he said at a political rally on December 31, last year. That was the day he declared support for Ruto. Five months later, he has lost his Senate job.
