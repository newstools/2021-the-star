Nairobi has been hit by a rash of gang robberies and a police anti-mugging unit is patrolling the CBD to arrest thugs. A robbery occurred on Tuesday night near the Kenya National Archives. Attacks on pedestrians increase during the rains and at night but also are committed in broad daylight. They lose money, phones, laptops, jewellery and other valuables. Police urge victims to cooperate with attackers for their own safety as fighting back can be dangerous. Sometimes, however, the situation can allow for escape. The anti-mugging squads will also patrol the Uhuru Highway where motorists have complained of being harassed. The road has been experiencing long traffic jams due to construction of the Nairobi Expressway. Thugs harass and rob motorists when they are stuck in traffic, especially late in the evening. Nairobi police boss Augustine Nthumbi said more officers have been deployed. "We have profiled some groups and their modus operandi and hunt is on," he said. Police are looking for a gang that attacks and robs pedestrians near the Kenya National Archives. Victims say the gang surrounds them, threatens them with a pistol and then grabs cash and electronics. The latest case was on Tuesday night. Pedestrian Francis Osiemo told police he was attacked by a gang of five men as he walked home. He was robbed of a laptop, two mobile phones and Sh6,200. He said they threatened to shoot him if he raised an alarm, and then they vanished down a dark alley. Police have also received complaints from four other people over the same gang. They are concerned many other people do not report robberies. Police say most attackers walk and operate in groups of five to eight people. (Edited by V. Graham)
