A family in Limuru constituency whose 21-year-old son was brutally murdered and his motorcycle stolen has asked the police to speed up their investigations and arrest the killers. Wilson Kiburio’s badly injured body was found at Chesire area in Tigoni last Monday. The family says although they have been helping police with the details they need, no one has been arrested yet. Kiburio’s brother James Wangunyu said the deceased used to operate from a stage near the Bata Company gate. He was hired by a man last week on Monday night to take him to Tigoni but he never returned. “My elder brother was hard working and had bought the motorcycle on loan. He hoped to clear the balance within six months,” he said. “We were told by his other workmates that he was hired by a man to take him to Tigoni, only to be found dead the next morning,” he said. Wangunyu appealed to area police commander Eilen Mola to speed up investigations. The family spoke on Tuesday during Kiburio’s funeral service at Jomaris village in Itungi area in Limuru. On Monday, boda boda riders engaged police in running battles when they blocked the Nairobi-Nakuru highway at Kwambira area with twigs, logs and bone fires to protest their colleague's killing. Mola said no one had been arrested but detectives were investigating the matter. Edited by Henry Makori
