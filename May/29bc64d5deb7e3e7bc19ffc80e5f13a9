The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has arrested a man suspected of defrauding unsuspecting Kenyans, by pretending to sell iPhones. In a statement by DCI on Tuesday, the suspect identified as Ochokol Victor Maina alias "Badman Anchor" has been running Instagram pages purporting to sell the phones and other Apple related products. DCI said that victims who had lost hundreds of thousands of shillings had lodged complaints about the individual. "Ochokol Victor Maina, alias ‘Badman Anchor’ who operates several Instagram pages including Bakcell Apple store and Netsol Apple store, was arrested following numerous complaints from members of the public," DCI said. According to the detectives, Maina would pose as a genuine dealer in iPhones and other Apple products. "He was arrested on charges of obtaining money by false pretenses contrary to section 313 of the penal code," DCI said. Maina will be arraigned in court on Wednesday. DCI further cautioned members of the public to desist from buying from unverified traders who have flooded the online market, preying on unsuspecting Kenyans. This comes a few days after DCI called on members of the public to formally report  experiences with fraudsters to the authorities for necessary action to be initiated. DCI said that it was in receipt of numerous complaints from members of the public who report to have fallen victim of a suspected fraud syndicate, operating within Nairobi’s Central Business District. "We appeal to members of the public who may have been hoodwinked by the fraudsters to report at DCI Headquarters’ Serious Crime Unit, to formally report their experiences with the syndicate for necessary Police action to be initiated," DCI said.
