A Chinese director was on Thursday charged with maliciously damaging a TV set and a refrigerator at an apartment in Nairobi contrary to the law. Liz Zheng was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto where he denied the charges. According to the charge sheet, he committed the offence on March 27 at Sandalwood apartment located at Broke side gardens in Westlands Nairobi. He damaged one LG TV set(42 inches), assorted furniture and one refrigerator all valued at Sh293,000 the property of Sandalwood Apartments. According to the police, he had leased the apartment and signed an agreement with the management before moving in. The police allege that Zheng then moved into the apartment with his wife and after some days he vacated the house without informing anyone contrary to the agreement. The management on inspecting the house found that the said items had been damaged and reported the matter to the police which led to his arrest. Yesterday through his lawyer, Zheng pleaded for lenient bond terms after denying the charges. Court prosecutor Allan Mogere urged the court to detain his passport but the accused person through his lawyer rejected the idea. “The accused person is a director of a company and, he requires the passport to do his duty across East Africa,” he told the court. The prosecution also told the court that since Zheng was a foreigner tough bond terms were required. The accused person through his lawyer however told the court that he was a family man and a breadwinner and asked for mercy. Kuto released him on Sh200,000 bond and directed that the case be mentioned on June 9. The magistrate also directed that Zheng deposits his passport in court.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
