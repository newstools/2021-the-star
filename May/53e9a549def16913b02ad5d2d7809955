Ten days ago President Uhuru Kenyatta revised stringent measures put in place to arrest the spike in Covid-19 infections. Kenyans, however, need to stay alert and keep their masks on properly, now more than ever as the Indian variant has been detected in the country. India, with all its health muscle, has been brought to its knees by the new variant. This should make Kenya, whose health care system is in tatters, extra cautious. To avert danger, the Health ministry should put out a spirited public awareness campaign on why, despite opening up of the economy, Kenyans should not let their guard down. It is a war that every segment of the economy needs to take seriously and act responsibly to win. Religious leaders should ensure social distancing is observed, congregations wear masks and sanitise frequently. The police, who are enforcing regulations, should ensure bars and eateries respect opening and closing hours, and matatus do not overload, so the nation is not dealt a debilitating health and economic blow. Lastly, schools should provide students with water and soap for hand washing plus ensure the children keep their masks on at all times.
