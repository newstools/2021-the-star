Bongo star Diamond Platnumz and his Wasafi Record Label have signed a new 360-partnership with Warner Music, a multinational entertainment and record label. Speaking about the new deal, Diamond said, “I've built WCB-Wasafi from the ground up and believe that Warner Music and Ziiki are the right partners to help further grow our reach. "I'm also looking forward to plugging into the Warner network myself. We’ve got some exciting plans and I can’t wait to share more music with the world.” The new deal will see WCB-Wasafi incorporated into Warner Music South Africa and Ziiki Media, to propel Diamond and his artistes to a worldwide audience through their global network. The 360 strategic partnerships will also see Warner Music, Diamond Platnumz, Ziiki Media and WCB-Wasafi artistes collaborate on new releases, catalogue, brand partnerships, live and sync deals.
