Police in Narok East have sent out an appeal to the public to help identify a body recovered in a thicket in Olombokishi area of Narok East. County police commander John Mutoro said the body was completely disfigured, with most of the parts missing, making it difficult to identify even the gender of the deceased person. He said the body was discovered by herdsmen on Thursday evening. The herders reported the matter to the area assistant chief, who informed the police. Mutoro asked on anyone who might have lost a loved one to report and help identify the body. The body is now lying at Narok Referral Hospital mortuary pending a postmortem and further investigations.
