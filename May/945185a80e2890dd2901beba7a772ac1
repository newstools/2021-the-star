Senators are set to debate the speech of Tanzanian President Suluhu Hassan during her address to the joint Houses of Parliament. President Suluhu addresses the joint sitting of the Houses during her visit to the country last Wednesday. Senate Deputy majority leader Fatuma Dullo tabled the speech on the floor on Tuesday before giving a notice of motion to debate the same. During the debate, each senator shall have 20 minutes to make their contributions with the exceptions of the majority and minority leaders who will each have a maximum of one hour. Standing Order 24(6) allows the senators to debate the President's speech. "That, pursuant to Standing Order 24 (6), the Thanks of the Senate be recorded for the Address to Parliament, by Her Excellency SamiaSuluhu Hassan, President of the United Republic of Tanzania,delivered on Wednesday, 5th May, 202," Dullo said as she gave the notice of motion. Suluhu became the second visiting head of state to address a joint sitting of parliament since independence. Former Tanzania President Jakaya Kikwete was the first visiting President to address a joint sitting of Parliament in October 2015. The head of state during his visit lauded President Uhuru KenyattaÂ  for standing with Tanzania when they lost President John Magufuli. Suluhu later extended a special invitation to President Uhuru Kenyatta to be the main guest as they celebrate 60 years of independence in December.
