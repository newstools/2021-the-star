Ministry of Public Service and Gender Chief Administrative Secretary Jebii Kilimo has decried the return of Female Genital Mutilation among Kipsigis community in South Rift. Kilimo said some men had boycotted food prepared by their uncircumcised wives. The CAS noted that some mothers who have not undergone the cut are sometimes circumcised by professional nurses during deliveries at local hospitals so as to remain married. Speaking in Kericho town, Kilimo said the ministry is committed to ensuring uncircumcised  girls pursue education to the highest level before voluntarily accepting to marry a man who will accept them in their uncircumcised status. She told county commissioners and subcounty commissioners to deal ruthlessly  with parents circumcising their daughters and marrying them off young even before completing their education. Accompanied by the newly appointed Kericho deputy governor Lily Ngok and Kericho East subcounty commissioner Darus Muyeshi, Kilimo said the retrogressive culture is slowly creeping back in Kericho and Bomet counties. She asked chiefs not to be compromised by parents who would want their daughters to undergo FGM before being married off. “Kipsigis community should ditch retrogressive practices that hinder the development of the girl child,” said Kilimo. She asked the Kalenjin community to carefully choose and maintain cultural values that benefit them and ditch those that would ruin their future. Kilimo urged Kipsigis men intending to marry not to discriminate against uncircumcised girls saying they are as good as those who have undergone the cut. -Edited by SKanyara
