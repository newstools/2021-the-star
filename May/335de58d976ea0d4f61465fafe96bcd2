Comedian Blessed Njugush says a tweet by Oscar award-winning actress Lupita Nyongo changed his life. He said a Twitter bigwig had criticised them for acting in the show ‘The real house helps of Kawangware’. The bigwig compared the show with those Lupita had acted in and said Njugush and his fellow actors would never reach her level. Speaking during an interview with Cleaning the Airwaves, Njugush said it is obvious that when you start something, people will discourage you. "When we started shooting ‘Real House Helps of Kawangware’, there is a bigwig who tweeted, blasting us for producing ‘show ya mamboch’," he said. “’Wanafanya show ya maboch na wanataka kufika level ya Lupita Nyong’o? Hawawezi fika by creating such shows.’ At the time Lupita had won an Oscar.” Njugush added, "A few months later, I woke up to congratulatory messages. On checking why, I saw Lupita had tweeted saying she was watching our show. 'Watching Real House helps of Kawangware. God bless Njugush.’ “At the time I was called Funny Njugush. After Lupita’s tweet is when I changed my name to Blessed Njugush. “We worked hard on the show till it became the most-watched show on TV.” Njugush added that a year later, he met the bigwig at an event and he was disgusted at his pretense. "He greeted me saying vile anapenda my work, kazi gani? Akwende huko." His advice to people starting a project: "When you start something, people will always talk, so do you and be consistent in your craft."
