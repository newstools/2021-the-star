Other than the timing it makes a mockery of the intention of the President to cut the country’s wage bill. At one point, he (President Uhuru Kenyatta) and his deputy were talking of taking a salary cut, something that they never did. The timing is such that even if he were to be entitled, he is still going to get a specific package for retired presidents. He will not spend anything at personal level for his own upkeep. I think it is an anomaly to pay him when he retires yet he commences a package immediately. Parliament should actually amend the law affecting payments of the President such as gratuity, which is a retirement package. The President is not going home, he is only stopping his job but the truth is the day he retires he begins another package almost immediately. Parliament staff should receive gratuity but I think the Executive, including the Deputy President, speakers and the likes – people who have statutory packages immediately they retire – should not be entitled to gratuity. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission should make this very clear so that it is not left to Parliament to be making such an appropriation. It is an anomaly that needs to be corrected, particularly for the President and people who are entitled to upkeep by the state after retirement. We are living too large, we will not sustain this in another five or 10 years as we keep changing leadership. That package should only be left for the President. Moving forward, it is also important to relook whether we can sustain that burden because for a taxpayer that is huge, keeping people on state budget long after they retire. It could be an incentive but it should be left only for the President and maybe the Deputy President. Anybody who is on state upkeep after retirement should not be given gratuity.
