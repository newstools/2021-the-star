ODM party leader Raila Odinga on Thursday spent a good part of his day with 2022 presidential candidate Mukhisa Kituyi. Raila who skipped the National prayer day at Parliament buildings, instead shared pictures of him with Kituyi and his wife. “Spent part of the day catching up…with  Kituyi and his wife at their residence. We compared notes and exchanged views on several topical issues. Good seeing this family,” Raila tweeted. Kituyi has declared interest in the presidential seat and resigned from his role as secretary general of UNCTAD. This is not the first time that Raila is meeting the former UNCTAD Boss. In February, Raila and Kituyi met in what Raila termed was a meeting after a 'long time'. The ex-UNCTAD secretary-general said he is his own man and has been driven by convictions to improve the lives of Kenyans. Kituyi is the latest entrant into the presidential race, with next year's general election still 15 months away. Kituyi said rejuvenating the economy will top his priorities if elected. During his tour at the Coast,  Kituyi wrapped up his Coast tour with a challenge to the authorities to use the top-bottom approach in fighting corruption as he eyes the youth vote. Kituyi said he has never been probed for corruption, adding that his integrity is his most precious asset. It is integrity he is banking on to win votes across the political divide, presenting himself as a man ready to sacrifice anything if involved in corruption. “If any of my children is involved in corruption, I will let the force of law deal with them appropriately and swiftly. And if you are sentenced to jail, you will serve jail. I am going to announce that to the nation of Kenya,” Kituyi said.
