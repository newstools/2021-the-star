Media personality Muthoni wa Mukiri has warned people not to quit their jobs to focus on creating YouTube content. Muthoni, who has been earning through her YouTube channel, discussed in detail how she has been faring on the platform since quitting her anchor job on Inooro TV. "The most money I have made in a month on YouTube was in March, when I made Sh65,000. The other months I made Sh35,000, Sh20,000 and I have also made Sh12,000," she said. "You can even make Sh1 million per month and you can also make Sh10,000. It is not consistent and that’s why you should not quit your daily income to focus on YouTube. "People with very many subscribers get to a point where they are making Sh1 million a month or Sh500,000, but you have to start from somewhere." The former Inooro TV news anchor has over 50k subscribers in six months since she started the channel. She wrote on Instagram, "We did it. Over 50,000 subscribers in just six months. Thank you my fans and followers for your support. God is always Faithful. Upwards and Onward." She said she earns hugely from adverts placed on her videos by the platform. The YouTube Partner Programme allows content creators to monetise their work on the platform once they hit the threshold of 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours. They can make money from ads that appear between their videos as well as from YouTube Premium Viewers who watch their content. "You can also get product placements or advertise brands for other people. For example, if your friend is selling clothes, you can mention them and they give you something small. People also make money that way, but I don’t do a lot of those because my content is a bit different. For me, it's the long game." Muthoni said she has invested in a Macbook laptop, Samsung phone, ring lighting and has improved on her editing skills. "When I was starting, I had someone editing for me, so I used to pay them every month. But after three months, I realised I couldn’t keep up," she said.
