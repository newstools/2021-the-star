President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday presided over as Justice Martha Koome took oath of office as the Chief Justice. "It's a singular honour to be the first president to swear in the first female Chief Justice of Kenya," Uhuru said. Koome took her oath of office at State House, Nairobi. The oath was administered by Judiciary Chief Registrar Anne Amadi. Court of Appeal president William Ouko also took his oath to serve as judge of the Supreme Court. The ceremony took under 10 minutes. Uhuru urged Koomed to promote fairness, independence and integrity. "Mine is to wish you God's blessings as you embark on your duties. We will pray for you. We are here to partner with you and work together with you," he said. "Fanya haki tu, na hatutakua na shida (Just be fair and there will be no problem)." On Wednesday appointed Koome the country’s Chief Justice making her the first woman to head an arm of Government. The three arms – Executive, Parliament and Judiciary – have over the years been an exclusive men’s club, a history that came to an end with Koome’s gazettement yesterday. The former Court of Appeal Judge who boasts of 33 years in the legal profession takes over from David Maraga who retired last year and will head Judiciary for a non-renewable term of 10 years. In a Gazette notice on Wednesday, the President appointed Koome hours after she was approved by the National Assembly. Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) which was conducting her approval hearing gave her unanimous endorsement disregarding four memoranda filed against her nomination for lack of merit. At the plenary, MPs unanimously voted to approve the report JLAC’s report recommending Koome’s approval to succeed retired CJ David Maraga. The Committee chaired by Kangema MP Kigano Muturi found Koome suitable for the demanding position and a person who has never been implicated in any questionable issues in her professional life.
