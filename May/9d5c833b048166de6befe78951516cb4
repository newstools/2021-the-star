 Dennis Cheruiyot Bett, the second most improved student, used to skip lessons in primary school. He sat his KCPE exam in 2016 and scored 190 marks out of a possible 500. Cheruiyot scored B- (minus) in the KCSE results announced on Monday. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha said he was the second most-improved candidate after Hassan Abdullahi Osman from Wayam Secondary School. Osman also scored a B- (minus) having posted 168 marks in KCPE in 2016. Cheruiyot told reporters at Kimargis Secondary School in Bomet on Monday that he used to skip classes in primary because of bad influence from friends, some of whom dropped out. It was through his determination that he posted the good results in KCSE despite the low marks in KCPE. The former school captain said he nearly abandoned his quest to join high school due to the 'demoralising' marks. It took encouragement from his parents and villagers for him to join secondary school. "My parents encouraged me to further my education, saying what I achieved in primary will not determine what I will score in secondary school and so I decided to join this day-school," he said. He said he used to walk for 6km to get to Maset Primary School and back home. The fourth child in a family of six says he wants to study education and become a teacher so that he can inspire others.
