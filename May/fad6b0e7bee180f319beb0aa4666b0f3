Two Kwale boda boda riders die each day in accidents due to reckless driving, county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri has said. Kanyiri said many of the motorbike riders are inexperienced, becoming the biggest threat to human life on the roads. "A majority of the boda boda riders learn driving on the streets and as long as they can ignite the machine they think they are ready rushing to highways," he said. He said many have been crushed to death by motor vehicles as they flout traffic rules. Speeding, carrying excess passengers, ignorance of road signs and unsafe clothing have cost the lives of many passengers and riders. The accidents are reported most in Kinango, Samburu, Diani, Ukunda, Vuga and Kombani. Kanyiri said some boda bodas ram onto lories and crash into ditches, killing themselves as they try to escape traffic police. He said many don't have driving licences and automobile insurance. "School children who sat for the recent KCPE examinations are now boda bodas riders," he said. The administrator advised residents to ask to see riders' IDs and driving licences before boarding a motorbike. He warned that a major crackdown on boda bodas is looming, saying stern action shall be taken against offenders. Last year, Kwale was listed among the regions with an alarming number of accidents, with 60 per cent linked to boda bodas and tuk tuks. Recently, three died and others were seriously injured at Vuga after the tuk tuk they were travelling collided with canter. Data from the National Transport and Safety Authority show that by December 2020 at least 3,589 people died from road accidents countrywide. About 1,020 deaths involved motorcyclists and 88 were pillion passengers.  (edited by o. owino)
