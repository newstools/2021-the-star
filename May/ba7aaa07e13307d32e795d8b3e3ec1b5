No away fans will be able to attend the final two rounds of Premier League matches this season when stadia reopen at reduced capacity. Supporters, currently excluded because of the coronavirus pandemic, will be able to return in smaller numbers from May 17, subject to government approval. It had been hoped up to 500 away fans could attend, but the Premier League says only home fans will be admitted. The final two rounds of matches will be played on May 18-19 and May 23. All teams have a home game in either the penultimate or final round of matches. “Following consultation with clubs, it was agreed matches would not be open to away supporters due to varying operational challenges across the league and the need to deliver a consistent approach, while maximising the opportunity for home-fan attendance,” a Premier League statement said. From May 17, outdoor sports venues in England are due to be allowed up to 10,000 fans or 25 per cent capacity, whichever figure is lower. Final UK government approval for the return will be announced no later than 10 May. Up to 2,000 fans were allowed at a number of Premier League matches in December, the last time fans were in attendance at top-flight games, before the country was locked down again. Some pilot events, such as the Carabao Cup final at Wembley where Manchester City and Tottenham each had 2,000 fans in attendance, have been held to test the safe return of spectators.
