Half of Mombasa teachers have yet to be vaccinated ahead of schools reopening for the third term. The region has approximately 5,100 teachers but only 2,805 had received the AstraZeneca jab by Monday. County health officials said the vaccine uptake among teachers has been low since the drive began on March 9. The officials had anticipated that all teachers would have been vaccinated by the time schools reopen. Education chief officer John Musuva said the early childhood department, primary schools and secondary school teachers had been informed on where to get the vaccine. “Those who were willing to get the vaccine, have already received their first jab,”  Musuva said. On Monday, Teachers Service Commission boss Nancy Macharia urged teachers to go for the jab. The county education department said they are ready for the third term of learning, as the country battles the third wave of Covid-19. “When the schools were opened in January, we already had enough supply of reusable face masks, sanitiser and hand-washing stations that would last the schools for a whole year,” Musuva said. Mombasa has vaccinated 25,592 people, which represents 14,750 males, 10,833 females and eight intersex. Health workers have recorded the highest number of those who have so far received the vaccine in the county. From the targeted 4,500 health workers, a total of 4,041 have so far been vaccinated. At least 1,497 security officers have also got the jab. Some 10,966 people have been listed as others and another 6,282 who are aged 58 years and above have also been vaccinated.
