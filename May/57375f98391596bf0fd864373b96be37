Property worth millions of shillings  was on Tuesday destroyed after Havanna Gardens Hotel in Mpeketoni, Lamu West, went up in flames. The hotel is said to have caught fire from a neighbouring compound where sawdust was being burnt. Confirming the incident, Lamu county disaster response team leader Luqman Abdulaziz said many of the premises had been destroyed by the time response officers arrived. “We understand a carpenter was burning sawdust in a compound next to the hotel before the fire overwhelmed him and spread into the hotel due to the strong winds,”  Abdulaziz said. “The hotel roof is purely makuti, which made the fire spread faster. We have put out the fire but a large section has been destroyed.” The hotel proprietor Isaac Muriithi said he had lost property worth Sh2.5 million in the morning fire. He faulted the county government for the delayed response which cost him most of his investment. “We made calls but they came hours later when nothing would have been salvaged,” Muriithi said. “Such tragedies require prompt response if you are to save anything at all. They were sluggish.” He appealed to well-wishers to help him reconstruct the hotel as it’s his only source of income. Residents have urged the county government to purchase up-to-date fire fighting equipment to tame fire disasters. On March 30, a fire razed down the Shalom Home for disabled children and destroyed property worth Sh4.5 million. “Let's have enough equipment and at least a fire station in each of the wards here. It's possible because the money is there,” community leader Kimani Wanyoike said.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
