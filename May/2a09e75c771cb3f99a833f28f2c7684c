The year 2020 was challenging. We had a global pandemic – Covid-19 – that interrupted the academic calendar. But still, our children managed to post very good results. There are many factors that contributed to this. First, the realisation that people were late and therefore teachers and students put in a lot of energy and extra time. They woke up very early and retired late in the evening to cover the syllabus and make up for the lost time. Secondly, a few schools managed to do online teaching. As such, they were able to quickly run through revision programmes and cover the syllabus as much as they could. I think a majority of the schools endeavoured to do some semblance of online teaching, which helped them to complete the syllabus so that when physical learning resumed it was easier to establish gaps. As opposed to those learners who just stayed at home without interacting with teachers, it was easy to establish the learning loss for those who had some kind of online lessons during the closure. Thirdly, the Kenya National Examinations Council, I think, was cognisant of the challenges and when setting the exam and took that into consideration. Education CS George Magoha said the examiners would take into consideration all the challenges that the students and teachers faced, which were not of their making. This was a global issue. I think all these factors put together, efforts put in, first by individual candidates and secondly, by the teachers, paid off. They realised that time had been lost and they needed to recover it and prepare for the exams, contributing to the good performance.
