Nairobi residents have been told to be on the lookout for impersonators soliciting them for money to facilitate the award of Nairobi Metropolitan Services tenders and contracts. “The NMS advises members of the public not to make any payments or engage with such agents or their proxies,” said NMS director general Mohammed Badi in a public notice. The NMS has dismissed as unlawful, illegal and fraudulent, any purported dealings in connection with procurement or contracts without its consent. “Any person purporting to solicit any money to influence the procurement process is doing so without authority or permission from NMS and does not represent NMS in any manner whatsoever,” Badi said. Members of the public who have fallen victim to the fraudsters have been urged to contact the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. At the same time, investigations are underway to ensure people involved in the fraudulent practices are promptly brought to justice. Badi's team says it undertakes procurement strictly in accordance with the law and the outcome is communicated to both successful and unsuccessful bidders. Last November, NMS carried out an eight-day staff validation to weed out ghost workers and impostors. This was after concerns were raised about "imposters who mislead the public and give false information" about NMS and its services. The exercise targeted all workers under the compliance and enforcement directorate. Some 6,852 employees were seconded to NMS, with the majority serving under the directorate.
