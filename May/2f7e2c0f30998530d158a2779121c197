Kenya and Ethiopia have agreed to share security intelligence at the Dawa and Liban zones; and Mandera county.

He said they concluded a two-day cross-border peace meeting between Mandera political leaders, security officials and Dawa and Liban zone officials led by provincial commissioners Mohamed Ali Kunaye and Mohamed Mohamud Adan. “This is the first time we have had such a level of cross-border engagement with our neighbours to discuss issues of peace building between our communities,” he said. Top leaders who attended the meeting included deputy county commissioner Banisa subounty Peter Ngeleyo, Senator Mohamud Mohamed Maalim, MPs Omar Maalim (Mandera East), Bashir Abdullahi (Mandera North), Adan Ali Sheikh (Mandera South), Kullow Hassan (Banisa), Mohamed Adan Khalif (speaker Mandera county assembly) and  Mandera Deputy Governor Mohamed Arai. Roba said the Ethiopian authorities promised to organise a peace meeting between Garre and Degodia clans on a later date. “We undertake that the administration of Kenya in Mandera county and Ethiopian Liban and Dawa zones administration take full responsibility to enforce security within their borders,” he said. The two teams also pledged to upscale administrative and security activities along the common border.
