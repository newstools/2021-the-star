Kenya’s solution to equitable access to clean water and sanitation lies on tackling both population pressure and climate change. In a statement, Reckitt General Manager Sachin Varma  said the two factors if unaddressed by all stakeholders could exert more pressure on already strained water infrastructure and could erode gains made towards achieving equitable access to clean water and sanitation in the country. He cautioned that more Kenyans risk facing a shortfall in water supply due to urban population explosion and environmental impacts on water systems and infrastructure. “The environmental impacts of changes that cause water stress will continue putting more pressure on this and therefore we need to continue to work on this to achieve the goal of ensuring equitable access to clean water and sanitation to all,” Varma said. WASH Programme estimates that 59 per cent of Kenyans don’t have access to clean water and slightly less than 29 per cent lack proper sanitation. According to Reckitt,  environmental factors are driving Kenya into greater water stress levels, either through deforestation and drought expansion making the environment a big contributor to poor access to water and sanitation. The UN projects at the current rate of drought and environmental stress placed on water, that by 2050 and at current trends, one in four people will have scarcity of clean water access. “Impact of water and sanitation in Kenya places a huge strain on our people and the economy driven by resulting implications on ill health, increased poverty and low productivity,” said Varma. Reports show that 21 million Kenyans have no access to safe and clean water and sanitation, estimated to cost the country Sh27 billion annually. “Having access to clean water will reduce healthcare stress, reduced poverty levels and improved rate of productivity. This requires investment in infrastructure for water, sanitation and hygiene practices and education,” he said.
