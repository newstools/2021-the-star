Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission investigating a Sh55 million tender award on Thursday raided the Nyandarua county government offices in Ol Kalou. The officers took several hours searching the county headquarters following award of a branding tender to Catapult Branding Consultants. EACC Central Kenya Regional Manager, James Rasugu said the commission had to investigate the matter following claims of conflict of interest, nepotism and misappropriation of funds. "There were claims that the owner of the company is a son of a senior official in the county government and we had to ascertain that," he said. Rasugu said the commission obtained a search warrant to look for crucial documents and equipment in several offices within the headquarters. He revealed their search concentrated on the governor's secretary's office and that of the finance department. "These two offices hold the crucial documents and equipment needed to conclude the investigations," he noted. Rasugu said the branding was part of a county investment forum function that never was despite the money having been allocated and spent. Rasugu said the commission was in the final stage of investigation after which they will make a report for action.
