Baringo residents living around flooded lakes have been urged to relocate to safer higher grounds to avert loss of life and properties this rainy season. Governor Stanley Kiptis on Saturday said lakes Baringo, Bogoria and 94 are already flooding owing to the ongoing heavy rains. “We are not ready to lose our people and their properties so we are calling upon them to take the early warning to migrate to safer grounds,” Kiptis said. He said villages in Baringo South like Salabani, Loboi, Loruk, Ng’ambo, Kiserian, Sintaan and Mosuro are already experiencing floods. Apart from floods he also warned those people living in the highland areas that they also stand the risk of landslides and falling rocks. “We fear if the rains persist then many people might get displaced but let's not wait until the situation worsens, families should get themselves out of the imminent dangers,” he said. Earlier in June last year more than 30,000 residents were displaced by the rising water levels in the above lakes located along the seismic active rift valley. “Since then we are still living as squatters. We have not received a single humanitarian help from any quarter,” Loruk resident Harun Cheburet said. The residents are also in need of foodstuff, drugs and they require tents to put up after their houses got submerged. Public facilities such as schools, dispensaries, churches and farms were also swallowed by the lakes. Owing to the constant rains, Lake 94 has already merged with Lake Baringo. Geologists are warning that the three lakes might merge and in case it happens then Lake Baringo shall cease being a freshwater body. Experts however blame extreme natural disasters like droughts and heavy rains on global warming and climate change. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
