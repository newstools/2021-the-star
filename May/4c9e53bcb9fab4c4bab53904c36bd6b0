Deputy President William Ruto over the weekend hosted his in-laws at his Karen home, during the engagement party of his firstborn daughter June Ruto. June is said to be marrying her Nigerian boyfriend, who alongside his family members visited Ruto's family. In the Kalenjin ceremony called 'Koito', the groom's family are invited into the room for dowry negotiations and to know each other well. Sharing on her social media, June wrote: "Finally: He who finds a wife finds a good thing, And obtains favour from the Lord. I thank God for the blessings in this memorable moment. Today has been an important day as I have my better half @AlexEzenagu. Sincere thanks go to God, my dad, mom, sister, friends and all relatives." In videos shared on social media, the guests could be seen dancing to traditional songs. The theme colour of the event was white with a touch of gold. In another post by one of the guests, Osita Chidoka said DP Ruto kept the event small and simple. "I was the negotiator at the bride price settlement ceremony. We haggled, we negotiated and in the end, we agreed on how many cows would be a fair price for the hand of June. Hon Ruto and his wife Racheal were great hosts. I regaled them with the Igbo customs, proverbs and more." In November last year, the DP had urged June to get married and settle down to raise a family. He was speaking during the traditional marriage ceremony between Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika and businessman Sam Mburu in Laikipia county. He paraded June alongside Dennis Itumbi and David Nzioka, who stood up as he was making his address. "Now that we have finished with our friends Sam and Susan, there is this young man called Dennis (Itumbi who was in attendance stands up). There is another one known as Nzioka. We also have June," he said. "They are our next candidates for marriage and they are good people. So we are ready to come back for more suitors here in Laikipia in future."
