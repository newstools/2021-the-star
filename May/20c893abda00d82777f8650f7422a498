The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has recovered stolen public assets worth Sh25 billion in the last five years. In a presentation to the Senate on Tuesday, the Commission said it has averted loss of Sh30.4 billion over the same period. It says that it now seeks forfeiture of Sh25 billion by public officers found to own unexplained wealth. Over the period, the commission investigated 1,000 cases. Out of which, 275 were concluded in court with 169 resulting in convictions. In 2019-20, the commission forwarded 163 filed to the Office of Directorate of Public Prosecutions and undertook 31 proactive investigations. EACC has investigated corruption offences worth Sh1.2 billion involving nine current and former governors. They are from the counties of Tharaka Nithi, Nairobi, Kiambu, Garissa, Samburu, Busia, Migori and Nyandarua. The allegations of unexplained wealth worth Sh11.5 billion involved Evans Kidero, Mike Sonko, Ferdinand Waititu and Moses Lenolkulal. The commission represented by chairman Eliud Wabukala and vice-chair Sophia Lepuchirit appeared before the Senate Justice and Legal Affairs Committee of the Senate on Tuesday. The Commission presented the status of the fight against corruption in the country.
