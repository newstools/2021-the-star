Nigerian music superstar Olamide has released visuals to his most anticipated single ‘Rock’, off his forthcoming album, ‘UY Scuti’. The 10-track LP is set for release on June 14. "The video takes viewers inside a noir vision of Lagos, starring flirtatious lovers plotting a rendezvous," he said in a statement. Rising Nigerian beatmaker Eskeez, who handles the lion’s share of production on ‘UY Scuti’, produced the intimate, mid-tempo Afrobeats scorcher. "The song is saying my lady doesn’t have to do too much to impress me. I love you already," Olamidé says. "It’s expressing what a guy would sing to a girl to give her confidence. I’m telling the women out there that if a man truly loves you, you don’t have to go overboard to please him."
