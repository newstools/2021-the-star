Nairobi acting Governor Ann Kananu has lauded MPs for passing the BBI Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020. Kananu said the BBI bill will improve the current Constitution to fulfill the social, economic and political needs of city residents. "A Constitution is a document that with time, continues to get better. Those things that others feel are not included will eventually be included. Our MPs have given direction with their votes. This document will come to you the Mwananchi for your say for a more prosperous Kenya," the acting Governor said. She spoke on Sunday during the wedding ceremony of Kayole Central MCA Jeremiah Karani Themendu. Kananu said the BBI will also ensure more opportunities for women in leadership. "BBI is not for certain leaders or tribes as people think," she said. All eyes are now on the Senate which is expected to vote on the bill next week after the Bill attained the required two thirds majority at the National Assembly. On Thursday at least 320 members participated in the vote at the second stage where 235 supported the bill, 83 for No while two abstained. Most allies of Deputy president William Ruto rejected the bill during the vote that largely took cue from the political alignments in the country. Some voted in support. During voting in the third reading, the Ayes were 224, Nays 63, while two abstained.
