Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has said traffic police officers have embraced technology to ensure that rules are adhered to by motorists. However, the IG said that even so, drivers are required to have physical driving licences with them in accordance with the law. “Yes, we have embraced technology and the law requires the driver to always have the Driving Licence physically with them,” Mutyambai said. The IG’s comments on Monday in his weekly engagement with Kenyans on Twitter contradicted what he had said in November 2020, that a motorist can show a digital DL as proof of being a licensed driver. “If you do not have the hard copy, you may show the officers the soft copy. Failure to do this attracts a fine of Sh1,000,” Mutyambai said last year. Mutyambai had said that the acceptance of the digital DL came after a user sought to know what happens to motorists when they forget their DL, however the latest remarks give a different picture. He also criticised motorists who overlap, saying that it is their personal responsibility to follow traffic rules and regulations. “Traffic police officers are there to enforce the law. Anyone found breaching this law, legal action will be taken.” While engaging with Kenyans, Mutyambai said that the police have focused their effort and attention on intelligence-led investigations and a multi-agency approach in combating rampant robbery where the culprits are using motorbikes to execute their plans. He also said that the issue of a Mombasa-based female police officer who posted a video on social media complaining of sexual harassment and mistreatment in the force is being handled internally through the Police Procedure.
