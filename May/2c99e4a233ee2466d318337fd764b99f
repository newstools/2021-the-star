His discipline has earned him the results despite coming from a very humble background,” Momanyi said. Momanyi attributed the school's good performance to its structured academic programmes. He said teachers worked hard. The school also has a strategic plan that provides a roadmap on the current and future academic programmes. “Our teachers go the extra mile beyond the normal academic timetable. It has become our tradition to work in a structured manner and this is one of the secrets of our excellence,” Momanyi said. Candidates at Asumbi Girls and Mbita Boys National Schools also improved in their performance. Asumbi Principal Linet Sati said they had 19 candidates with A plain which she described as a good improvement. “The school has never recorded A plain in the past four years. We’rehappy with the results,” Sati said. At Mbita Boys, Principal Kennedy Ojijo said the academic performance had been achieved because of co-operation between teachers, students and parents. The school had more than 9 candidates with A plain. “It is a show of commitment and dedication to academics. Parents have also been supportive too,” Ojijo said.
