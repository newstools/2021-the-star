Leaders in Nairobi have challenged the BBI proponents who were jolted by the court ruling halting the constitutional review process to respect the judicial decision. They said the best approach is to pursue the matter at the court of appeal without disparaging established institutions. Former Makadara MP Reuben Ndolo, Jubilee politician Francis Mwangi and former Nairobi mayor Habin Omar said though the ruling by the three-judge bench was disheartening, it was important to respect court decisions. The leaders who spoke in Kajiado during the burial of former Nairobi county assembly speaker Alex Ole Magelo said a country cannot thrive democratically if the decisions of each arm of government are not respected. “We are hurt yes, but it is wrong to call judges all sorts of names. What is required is to follow the due process of the law and appeal,”  Mwangi said. “We are the Wanjikus and this BBI has more gains to offer. Let our able team of lawyers take our petitions to the court of appeal and we are looking forward to having a referendum within this year.” Dozens of BBI proponents have hit out at the Judiciary over the ruling delivered last Thursday that stopped the process terming the court decision as judicial activism. Some of those aggrieved have claimed the five Judge bench of the High Court made very personalized attacks against President Uhuru Kenyatta. This is after the bench led by Justice Joel Ngugi scuttled the BBI process, terming the entire process as illegal, null and void. The judges cited about 20 grounds for nullification of the process, including a declaration that the BBI task force that engineered the law change is an illegal entity. The expressed optimism that the High Court ruling will be set aside by the appeal court adding that the anti-BBI team should not celebrate yet. Ndolo on his part said though they are not happy, all established institutions must be respected.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
