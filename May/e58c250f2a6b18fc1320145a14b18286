Former Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has denied claims that he has joined UDA. He said though he has not joined the party linked to Deputy President William Ruto, there was nothing wrong with working with the DP. "Although I have not officially joined the DP, I don't see anything wrong in working with him politically," the ex-governor said. The former governor spoke in Nyando constituency on Saturday. Ranguma was among politicians and professionals from Nyanza who attended a strategy meeting on Thursday last week with Deputy President Ruto’s team. The professionals crafted what they call an economic blueprint, which will form part of Ruto's 2022 manifesto. But ODM chairman John Mbadi dismissed the new Ruto team and termed them "political rejects looking for food". Mbadi said the group does not represent the wishes of the Nyanza region. "If they think they have voters behind them, let them go and contest against those who will be nominated by ODM in 2022. Those are tumbocrats,” he told the Star. Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma described the group as "individuals trying to keep themselves busy with a cup of tea in city hotels”. “They have zero impact. These are individuals who belong to our past,” he told the Star. Last month, it emerged that Ruto was quietly wooing Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya in what would be a big blow to Raila. The DP said he had secured a political deal with many leaders, including governors and Cabinet secretaries who are too shy to come out publicly for fear of political persecution. “Because of the nature of politics, many of them prefer that we have these meetings in private,” he said.
