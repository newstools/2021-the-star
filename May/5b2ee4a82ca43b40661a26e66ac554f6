Bongo star Harmonize has congratulated his ex-girlfriend actress Jacqueline Wolper for her baby. Wolper welcomed a baby boy a month ago with Tanzanian designer Rich Mitindo. She shared a video on social media breastfeeding her baby, which got fans and other celebrities reacting to it, including her ex-boyfriend Harmonize. The ‘Attitude’ hitmaker wrote, “Congrats, J; it was a dream, happy to see this come true.” Wolper responded with a ‘Thank You’ emoji. Wolper was the first public girlfriend the singer had just right after he was signed by Diamond Platnumz on WCB. At the time, Wolper was well known for her roles in Bongo movies, and the couple was adored by many. The two split after Wolper revealed the singer was cheating on her with Sarah Michelotti, an Italian woman whom he later married but separated from last year. Months later, Harmonize exposed Wolper for also cheating on him with Rich Mitindo, the man she has welcomed the baby with. On Sunday, Wolper and her baby daddy marked 40 days since they welcomed their son. She wrote on her Instagram that she took him to the church, where he was dedicated.
