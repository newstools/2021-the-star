Traders at Ichuga trading centre on the outskirts of Nanyuki town are counting losses after fire gutted their premises. The inferno is believed to have originated from a supermarket and spread fast to adjacent shops, destroying stock worth millions of shillings. No one was injured. Among the affected businesses were the supermarket, electronic shops, bars and restaurants, boutiques and butcheries. Residents noted that the fire started at 5am and it was difficult to put it off for lack of water. Firefighters from Laikipia county arrived in time to assist put off the fire before it could spread to the neighbouring shops where it would have caused more havoc. “The Nyeri county government has neglected this area with most of the services being offered by the Laikipia county government,” Camden Mwangi said. He said leaders from Nyeri have totally abandoned the area and questioned why they pay levies to a government that does not offer services. The centre lies between the two counties. Residents suggested that they had better be pushed to Laikipia where they get most of the services including garbage collection, water and even security. Firefighters from Nyeri arrived late when the fire was already contained. The affected people have called for the firefighting services by the Nyeri government to be brought closer at Naro Moru. “Kieni MP Kanini Kega should lobby for services delivery to all his constituents the same way he has been involved in national politics,” Anthony Muriithi said. Police have since launched investigation into what may have caused the fire. Edited by Henry Makori
