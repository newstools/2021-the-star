Tragedy has struck a family in Canaan village, Kanamkemer in Turkana Central after three children drowned in pool of water. Confirming the incident on Sunday, Turkana central Sub County Police Commander David Mburukua said the three children who drowned at the pool of water, two are siblings and one is their cousin. He said the three deceased boys aged twelve, eleven and nine years old, were herding goats near a quarry of water before they ventured to swim. "The police officers responded to the scene and managed to retrieve the bodies of the three minors and took them to Lodwar morgue,” he said. Mburukua has advised the pool of water that’s quarry to be sealed off to avoid further issues that may affect the community. “I saw four boys herding goats around the pool of water. Two of them entered into water and started to swim. It didn’t take long, the oldest boy learnt that the minors have been overpowered by water and he entered in to rescue them and that’s how they all drowned. The other one who was behind the scene ran home to call parents,” Nelly Esekon an eye witness said. According to Duncan Echoto, a resident of Canaan village, said the internal displaced people from Kitale living in Canaan area have been sourcing soil from the quarry to build their houses. “The internal displaced people from Kitale, when they came to settle in Canaan, the contractor got soil from this area to construct their houses and since 2011, this quarry has been existing,” he said. He has urged the government to protect the pool of water by fencing it to stop endangering lives of people since it also helps the community to feed their livestock.
