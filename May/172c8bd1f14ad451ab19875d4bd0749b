Singer Avril Nyambura says motherhood is the best thing that ever happened to her as it has given her a purpose in life. The mother of one says she had for so long wanted to be a mother and now she is living that dream. Avril is raising her three-year-old son. Speaking during an interview with Ala C, she said she was very ready to be a mum. "I had been ready five years before I became one, but I never had someone stable in my life," she said. "I wanted someone we take care of the child together and so when the person I am dating came into my life, the situation felt right and he also wanted it." On how it’s been being a working mum, Avril said there is pressure and stress. "You should respect mothers. When my son was a day old is when it hit me that I no longer had a say," she said. "It would always be about him as he now fully depends on me. In the beginning, I was a walking zombie because I could not get enough sleep. Even now I still survive on very little sleep as I also have to chase my dream." She added that balancing motherhood and work at times can be confusing and it’s easy to become depressed as one learns on the job. "I used to make money and did everything I wanted, but now my child has given me a purpose. I have become more responsible. The love for him is unconditional, It’s a feeling you can’t understand."
