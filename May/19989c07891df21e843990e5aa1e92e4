Can defending champions Gor Mahia shake off their horrid start to the season to clinch their 19th Football Kenya Federation Premier League title? K’Ogalo will be locking horns with Wazito at Utalii Grounds on Monday in a rescheduled FKF-PL fixture and a win could fire them to within seven points of leaders Tusker, who have 38. The reality of the Green Army laying claim to their 19th top-flight title remains alive, following inconsistent results posted by KCB, Tusker and AFC Leopards in recent matches. KCB and Tusker had initially stamped authority and displayed great potential as favourites but have struggled to collect maximum points recently. They are not the only palpable threat to K’Ogalo though. The Vaz Pinto charges must also fend off cutthroat competition from traditional arch-rivals AFC Leopards, who are two points off the brewers following a 3-1 hiding by Bidco Sunday afternoon. Gor will be heading into today's encounter as red-hot favourites, having literally run over their opponents in all their last four fixtures, including a domestic cup encounter against Congo Boys. Bogged down by deepening financial woes, the future of Wazito in the competition looks bleak. All is not well at the Moneybags with reports emerging a number of players quit the club's WhatsApp group on Saturday in a huff after President Ricardo Badoer reneged on an earlier promise to offset the three months salary arrears owed to staff. Francis Kimanzi's charges have slid down to tenth on the log with 23 points after maintaining a top-six position for the better part of the first half of the season. Their last league match against Tusker at Utalii Grounds on May 21 ended in a one-all tie.
