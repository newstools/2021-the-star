A three-judge bench of the High Court has quashed several gazette notices, nullifying the appointment of 128 appointed to various parastatals in 2018. This now deals a big blow to over 128 Kenyans including politicians who were appointed to various parastatals after the court ruled that their appointments were unconstitutional. Among those who were appointed during that period included Former Chief of Defense Force Julius Karangi, former Governor Benjamin Cheboi and Margaret Saitoti. The Attorney General has asked the court to stay the judgement for 30 days. However, Lawyer Dudley Ochiel for Katiba Institute has opposed the application asked the court to order them to file a formal application. Justices Jessie Lessit, Chacha Mwita and Lucy Njuguna declined to stay the judgement and directed the AG to file a formal application giving reasons for his request. In the case, Katiba Institute and Africog had sued the state arguing that it was illegal for the President and his cabinet secretaries to appoint the said 128 people to parastatals. They argued that there were no advertisements for the positions. According to them, the state was rewarding politicians who lost in the 2017 general elections and former army chiefs. The Court also invalidated various post-2010 statutes which allow appointments to parastatals without requiring fair competition or merit. Interestingly the terms for the 128 individuals ends this June but petitioners argue that the judgement applies to all other appointments made since then, This is because the court has nullified some sections of the Constitution on appointments
