Atheists in Kenya secretary Seth Mahiga has resigned after finding Jesus. Mahiga who has been in the society for one and half years resigned on Saturday evening. "Seth's reason for resigning is that he has found Jesus Christ and is no longer interested in promoting atheism in Kenya. We wish Seth all the best in his new found relationship with Jesus Christ," Atheists president Harrison Mumia said. Mumia thanked him for having served the society with dedication. He said Kenyans interested in the position should send their CVs to info@atheistsinkenya.org. Last year, Atheists in Kenya Society welcomed gospel singer Ruth Matete to join the movement after she blasted church leaders for hypocrisy. Mumia, said they followed Matete’s reports concerning Christians’ hypocrisy pleaded with her to join them and experience peace of mind. Matete went through a very difficult phase following the death of her husband Pastor John Olakami Apewajoye in April. She added that church leaders abandoned her with some prophesying that she would be jailed over her husband’s death.
