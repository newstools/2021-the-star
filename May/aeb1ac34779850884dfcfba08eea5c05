A former Kitui councillor has been charged with forcible detention of land in Kitui town claimed by Checker Oil Products and assembly speaker George Ndotto. John Malinga appeared before Kitui senior principal magistrate Margaret Kasera on Tuesday. Malinga denied the charges and was released on Sh100,000 cash bail or a bond of a similar amount until May 26 when the matter will be mentioned. Environmentalist Isaac Kalua also claims ownership of the plot. Ndotto maintains former President Daniel Moi gave the land to him as he served as the Minister for the Reclamation of Arid Lands. A report by the Ministry of Lands dated December 31, 2019 shows Ndotto was given the land on verbal instructions by the President, but his allotment letter was later withdrawn. Malinga had occupied part of the land that is opposite the Kitui GK prison along the Kitui-Thika road for years. He has a metal workshop there as a tenant of Ndotto. Checker Oil Products has also produced a title deed for the ownership of the same piece of land. The firm says it was allocated the land by the Ministry of Lands in 1998. In a recent press release, Checker Oil Products said it has been frustrated by squatters and trespassers on the land for years. “We remain committed to executing our plans of constructing a shopping mall on the property, a project that will attract investors in Kitui town and create jobs,” the statement read. The Ministry of Lands records say that on January 21, 1998, Checker Oil Products applied for the plot which had remained undeveloped for years and their request was approved on June 25, 1998.
