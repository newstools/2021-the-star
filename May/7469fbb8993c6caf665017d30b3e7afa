Agribusiness firm Kakuzi marked the operationalisation of the Lamu port on Thursday, by shipping its first batch of avocado cargo. The 80-ton avocado shipment set for France will be transported by MV Seago Bremerhaven which docked at the Lamu port on Thursday. In a statement, Kakuzi Managing Director, Chris Flowers, said the port will benefit Kenyan producers greatly. "We are excited at the operationalisation of the first berth at the Port of Lamu. This development begins to crystalise the Lamu-Port-South-Sudan -Ethiopia-Transport Corridor project," Flowers said. He noted that Kakuzi has shipped five 40-foot containers with Hass Variety Avocados. Each container holds about 20,000 kilograms of avocado. "Each container has a controlled atmosphere cooling system that keeps the air at 6 degrees and scrubs the air to prevent the fruit from ripening," he added. The agro-business firm has made clear its plan to invest Sh400 million in strengthening value addition to complement production of avocado in Kenya to international standards. On Thursday, President Uhuru Kenyatta presidedÂ over the operationalisation of the first berth of the 32-berth seaport in Lamu. The president said he will in a few months go back to Lamu with several African heads of state, to launch all the three berths of the Port. Berth one is 100 per cent complete, berth two and three will be completed in July and October respectively.
