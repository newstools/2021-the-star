The government of Kenya through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has contributed a consignment of humanitarian aid to India consisting of coffee, tea, and groundnuts. The PS in the ministry Ambassador Macharia Kamau flagged off the consignment on Saturday, May 22, 2021. The government said that the gift is a token of solidarity and support destined to the medical fraternity in New Delhi and Mumbai whose members are currently at the forefront of the battle with Coronavirus. “It is symbolic of appreciation of the excellent bilateral relations with India,” the ministry said. The government added the Kenyan people will always remember with gratitude the excellent medical services offered by Indian doctors to Kenyan patients who have traveled to India over the years for advanced medical care. India is currently battling the B.1.617 variant that has spread to a number of countries including Kenya. The variant forced India to stop the exportation of the vaccines as it prioritised saving the lives of its citizens. Following the suspension of exportation, the Kenyan government told its citizens who were expecting to get their second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine in early May will now be required to wait for four more weeks to do so. The Ministry of Health has issued the new directives in the wake of the looming shortage of vaccines as a result of the global supply chain challenges. India has been supporting Kenya and in March this year, Kenya received 100,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines donated by the government of India.
