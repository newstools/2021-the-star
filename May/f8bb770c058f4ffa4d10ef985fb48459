The United Democratic Alliance has welcomed the withdrawal of People's Empowerment Party candidate, in the Kiambaa by-election. In a statement, secretary general Veronica Maina said Moses Kuria-led PEP's withdrawal is out of goodwill, because UDA supported his candidate to a successful election in Juja. "This will give the Hustler Nation an opportunity to focus on the campaigns without unnecessary division and negative energy," Maina said. She went on to say UDA is not owned by Johnston Muthama or controlled by sitting MPs as claimed by Kuria, as he announced the withdrawal of the PEP candidate. Maina insisted that UDA is a party that represents all hustlers in the country. "For the first time, there is a party that has deliberate representation of all hustlers. This has been affirmed by the choice of our candidates in Kiambaa and Muguga" "UDA is a party of the people that believes in democracy, transparency, unity and that every hustle matters," Maina added. The statement came after Kuria announced the withdrawal of PEP in the Kiambaa by-election,  after consultations with Deputy President William Ruto. The People's Empowerment Party was fielding Raymond Kuria as its candidate. In a statement, Kuria said his party arrived at the decision to appease colleagues in the Hustler Nation who were not happy with his decision to field a candidate in Kiambaa. "...This did not go down very well with my colleagues particularly Rigathi Gachagua and Kimani Ichungwa. Yesterday, I held extensive discussions with my boss and friend H.E Dr William Ruto on this matter" "To make my two colleagues happy and above all for the unity of the Hustler Nation, PEP will not be fielding a candidate for the Kiambaa by election." UDA unveiled its candidates for the upcoming Muguga ward and Kiambaa constituency by-election on Friday. John Njuguna Wanjiku and Kamau Thumbi received their nomination certificates for Kiambaa and Muguga at the party headquarters, in an event presided over by  Maina.
