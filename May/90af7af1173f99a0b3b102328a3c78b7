An 81-year-old man committed suicide in Lugari constituency, Kakamega county, out of anger after he was robbed of Sh6,000. Family members said Keya Waluchio had earlier lamented about the loss, saying he had been attacked. The cash was meant for the treatment of his ailing son. He committed suicide at Mahemas village in Marakusi sub-location in Lugari on Tuesday night. Waluchio's sister Priscilla Mugasi said he had sold his only cow for Sh7,000 to take his son to hospital. “The way my brother was complaining about those who robbed him indicated he was really pained because the robbery had rendered him unable to treat his son who has been ailing for some time now. This may have triggered him to take his life,” Mugasi said. She said Waluchio had said the robbers were well-known to him. He suffered slight injuries during the incident. The son, Haron Wafula, who lives in Eldoret said his father had called him and informed him that he wanted to take him to a doctor who the old man believed could cure his problem. “I travelled on Tuesday and arrived here (home) at around 5pm but my father was not around. I waited for him and he came back at about 8pm. We prepared supper, ate and later chatted until about 11:30pm when I excused myself to go and sleep,” Wafula said. He said his father is always an early riser but did not do so on Thursday morning. Wafula got concerned after the old man failed to wake up by about 10am. He decided to find out what the matter was. "I found the door locked from inside and after several knocks, decided to break a window. That is when I saw his body dangling from the roof." Officers from Lumakanda police station removed the body to Kimbilio Funeral Home in Uasin Gishu county. Investigations into the death have been launched.   Edited by P.O
