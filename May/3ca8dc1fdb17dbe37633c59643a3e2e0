President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked MPs to consider fast-tracking the passage of bills that will help the country achieve universal healthcare. The President said Kenyans deserve to access the standard of healthcare that senior leaders in the country enjoyed when they were down with Covid-19. Parliament read for the first time on May 13, the National Hospital Insurance Fund (Amendment) Bill, 2019 which seeks to make employers pay NHIF for their staffers. The bill also proposes mandatory NHIF contributions by all Kenyans above 18 years who are not dependents of a contributor to the scheme. President Kenyatta said Kenyans heard for themselves the challenges the country still faces with the lack of standard and quality healthcare. The President asked the speakers of the National Assembly and Senate to expedite the passage of the bill, alongside any that helps Kenyans get healthcare. “Health insurance is the basis of us being able to offer universal healthcare. Expedite the passage of these pieces of legislation that will allow us for our people to access quality healthcare,” the President said. The NHIF bill has met opposition, including from workers who were going to benefit, from the bill. Cotu recently rejected the bill saying it would spell the death of the NHIF and called for the status quo to be maintained.
