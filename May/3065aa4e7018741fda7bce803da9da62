Olympics Kenya president Paul Tergat on Saturday sent a message of condolence to family and friends of former Kenya Rugby Sevens coach Benjamin Ayimba. Ayimba lost the battle on Friday at the Nairobi hospital’s High Dependency Unit, where he had been admitted since late last year after being weighed down by a bout of cerebral malaria. “We have learnt with a very heavy heart and sadness the death of Benjamin Ayimba, former rugby Sevens national coach this Friday,” said Tergat. “The family has lost a loving member, who bravely and strongly fought his illness like the steel in him. For us in the sporting world, it is such a huge blow,” he added Tergat observed that Ayimba had inspired an entire generation and put Kenya on the map both as a player and a coach. “Benjamin is synonymous to our sport of rugby development and growth in such a massively loved, played and followed sport that has taken our country into the helm of sport in the world. “Indeed, it has been during his hey days at the national team that the sport was admitted as an Olympic sport,with Benjamin leading Kenya’s first appearance at the Games not forgetting leading Kenya to its first ever Sevens World Series title,” he said. Before transitioning into coaching, Ayimba had a glittering career at Kenya 15s and 7s international. “On my own and family, NOC-K Executive and management team plus the Olympic family in Kenya’s behalf, I extend our condolences to his family, friends and millions of fans beyond our borders during this difficult moment of grief,” said Tergat.
