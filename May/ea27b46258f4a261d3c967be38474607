Police in Keumbu in Kisii are hunting for a lab technician who allegedly battered and stabbed his nephew to death over poor grades. Villagers said the suspect (name withheld), had taken  the 10-year-old boy to task over poor grades, saying many of his age mates were several classes ahead, while he had to repeat classes. "Angered by the boy's explanation, he beat him with a cane. Minutes later he took a kitchen knife and stabbed him in the chest, killing him on the spot," acting chief James Momanyi said of the killing on Saturday. The minor had not provoked the suspect in any manner and had only come visiting as a relative, the chief said. "Being a weekend, the boy had been sent by his mother to greet his grandmother and the uncles before returning to school on Monday," Momanyi said. He was at  the suspect's eldest brother's house. The chief said other family members tried unsuccessfully to make him stop. "He instead pierced him in the chest, killing him as he pleaded for his life. The suspect has run away but police are in his hot pursuit " the administrator told the Star by phone. The suspect continued brutalising the minor and chased away those who tried to stop him. The body was taken to a mortuary for a postmortem exam. (Edited by V. Graham)
