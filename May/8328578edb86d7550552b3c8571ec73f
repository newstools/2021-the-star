Three counties neighbouring the Konza techno city have signed an MoU reassuring of their commitment to the creation of a buffer zone around the city. In an announcement by Interior CS, Fred Matiang’i, on Tuesday, the move by Kajiado, Machakos and Makueni counties will prevent Konza from encroachment and uncontrolled developments. This according to the CS will protect thousands of jobs, investments and wildlife. "Grateful to the leadership of Kajiado, Makueni and Machakos Counties on the agreed MOU signed today creating a buffer zone around Konza City," Matiang'i said. Present during the signing of the memorandum of understanding were Cabinet secretaries; Joe Mucheru (ICT), Farida Karoney (Lands)and Najib Balala (Tourism), Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku and representatives of the other counties. In April, the three counties suspended issuance of new development permits in areas falling within the 10km radius around the Konza Technopolis, for a period of 90 days. The county governments of Machakos, Makueni and Kajiado said the suspension was to enable a newly constituted Inter-County Joint Physical and Land Use Planning Committee to develop an Inter-County Physical and Land Use Development Plan to provide guidelines and standards for regulation of land use practices and general development within the zone. The plan would provide basic guidelines and standards for regulation of land use practices and general development while controlling activities for the respective counties bordering the Technopolis. It will also guide developers and property owners on acceptable standards.
