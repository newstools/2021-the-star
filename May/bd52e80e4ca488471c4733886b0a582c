It was a joyful day for Deputy President William Ruto and his family as he officially handed over the hand of his daughter - June - to her Nigerian husband Dr Alexander Ezenagu. The invite only wedding ceremony was held at Ruto's private residence in Karen, saw only close friends and family witness the two exchange their vows, with an adult reception following later at the same venue. In the morning, Ruto had attended the national prayer breakfast meeting, before making his way to his daughter's wedding. June's wedding was filled with pomp and colour as guests graced the event in their top notch outfits. Several guests chose to keep with a rose theme for their outfits, as others played around with warm colours. The lady of the hour, June, was dressed in a simple satin, white strapless gown with a cathedral veil, hair well held together, white peep toe heels, beautiful jewellery and a bridal bouquet. The man of the hour was dressed in a navy blue fitting suit, a black bow tie and black shoes, giving his look a crisp touch. DP Ruto was dressed in a black morning coat also known as Cutaway, black leather shoes and complimented the look with a black fedora hat, giving it that 1920s vibe. The mother of the bride - Mama Rachel Ruto - was not left behind as she stunned in a rose dress, with well thought-out details, well done makeup that complimented her natural look and to accessorize, she wore a rose fascinator and a gold clutch bag. June's husband alongside his family members visited Ruto's family early this month for dowry negotiations and introductions. Ezenagu holds an LLB from the University of Ibadan in Nigeria and is also a graduate of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. He currently is an Assistant Law Professor at the Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar.
