 The Laikipia county administration has unveiled a modern Geographic Information Systems lab meant to eliminate land fraudsters that have been swindling unsuspecting buyers. Governor Ndiritu Muriithi on Friday said the laboratory will streamline land transactions and give citizens assurances of authenticity of leases. The laboratory, located at the county department of infrastructure in Nanyuki town, has over 5,000 digitised registry index maps that were obtained from the Survey of Kenya. The equipment also contains 1,400 digitised Part Development Plans. “Large number of PDPs that are in circulation in Laikipia are not properly approved. This creates doubt as to the legality of land leases that were processed pursuant to those PDPs,” Muriithi said. The county is working jointly with the National Land Commission and the Ministry of Lands to streamline operations. “If you are dealing with land transactions in Laikipia, we urge you to use this facility to do better research. There has been massive land fraud in the county and investigations have been ongoing,” Muriithi said. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has been conducting a wide-ranging probe into land fraud which involves forgery of PDPs and generating back-dated allotment letters. Nanyuki and Rumuruti towns are potential hotspots where fraudsters have been yearning for riparian land, government compounds, Kenya Railways reserves among other parcels. The county government has modernised the land registry in Nanyuki town and the filing system revamped. A new land registry has been opened up at Rumuruti town to serve the larger Laikipia West subcounty.  Edited by P.O
