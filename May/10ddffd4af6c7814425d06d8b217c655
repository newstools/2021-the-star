A city lawyer has filed a case in court challenging the recruitment notice for the CEO of the Water Services Regulatory Board. Adrian Kamotho says the board has introduced an avalanche of requirements that are not provided for under the Water Act, 2016 or any other valid law. Section 17 (2) of the Water Act sets out the qualifications for appointment as the chief executive officer of the board. A candidate must be a citizen of Kenya, holds a degree from a university recognised in Kenya, have at least 10 years relevant work experience with at least five years in a senior management position either in a public service or private sector organisation, and meet the requirements of leadership and integrity set out in Chapter Six of the Constitution. The vacancy notice by the board sets out the minimum qualifications of at least 15 years working experience, five of which must have been in senior management and a master’s degree. Kamotho says that the recruitment notice is heavily tainted with illegality and offends various sections of the Water Act. “The decision by the board discloses an ulterior motive and purpose calculated to influence the recruitment outcome in favour of a preferred candidate while prejudicing the legal rights of the other qualified members of the public,” he says. He has asked the court to quash the vacancy notice, which closed on May 18. Employment and Labour Relations Court Judge Monica Mbaru certified the matter as urgent and said she will issue further directions on May 25 once the board has been served. Kamotho says the board has no legal basis to issue the subject recruitment notice in the manner it has. “Despite attention being drawn to the board on the illegality of the published recruitment notice for the position of the chief executive officer, the board has refused to rectify the vacancy notice in respect of the law,” he says.
