DP William Ruto continues to meet leaders to publicise his bottom-up approach as his Hustler philosophy ahead of the 2022 General Election. On Tuesday, the DP met former councillors from Kajiado county to discuss the bottom-up economic model. "...being grassroot leaders, they have a key role to play. We are rooting for an expansive, inclusive and broad-based economic intervention that will give ordinary Kenyans a chance to make a living and create wealth," Ruto said. "In the long-run, these signature reforms will boost people’s standards of living & foster the country’s growth sustainably." MPs Katoo ole Metito, George Sunkuyia,  Aisha Jumwa and Kimani Ngunjiri were among the present officials. According to Ruto, trickle-down economics has been practiced in Kenya for a long time, and it is time to move to the bottom-up approach which will bring onboard all Kenyans. Ruto has been defending the Hustler narrative, saying that those who fall in the category are the answer to the country's economic woes. He has also said the bid to end the economic distress informs his 2022 bid. The DP had earlier said that there is a need for the country to change its economic model in order to help more than 15 million jobless Kenyans. Last week, Ruto met leaders from Mt Kenya region to discuss how to re-engineer Kenya's economy. In an array of pictures shared online, Ruto said they are taking collaborative effort to promote enterprise and foster the empowerment of ordinary Kenyans. Ruto met with three representatives from each of the 11 counties from Mt Kenya region as a follow-up to the Maasai Mara meeting.
