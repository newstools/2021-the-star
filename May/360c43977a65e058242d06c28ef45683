The Council of Governors has called on Treasury CS Ukur Yatani to hasten release of Sh66 billion owed to counties. In a statement on Wednesday, CoG chair Martin Wambora said the funds owed for the months of December 2020, January, February, March and April should be released, to allow counties prepare for Covid-19 and pay their pending bills. The Embu Governor stated that Treasury has not paid Sh2.6 billion to Nairobi County for the months of December and January, Sh10 billion to two counties for  February and Sh25 billion to the 47 counties for March. Wambora added that Sh28 billion is owed to all the counties for April 2021. "We note that we are one month to the end of the financial year. We therefore call upon the National Treasury to expedite the release of these funds to allow County Governments enhance their response measures towards  the Covid-19 pandemic, pay their pending bills and develop the counties," said Wambora. The CoG chair also updated on the county preparedness in handling the Covid-19 pandemic, and the measures set by the 47 counties. Wambora noted that the transport sector has become one of the biggest contributing factors to rapid spread of Covid-19, despite efforts by the counties to curb the spread of the disease. He called on players in the transport sector to be vigilant, and strictly adhere to set guidelines. "In light of the reopening of schools, we urge the matatu sector to ensure adherence of the strict limit on the number of passengers aboard in PSVs," added Wambora.
