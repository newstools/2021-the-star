Vera Sidika's ex-lover Jimmy Chansa has for the first time opened up about his relationship with the socialite. Speaking to Simulizi na Sauti, Chinasa praised Vera, describing her as a charming person. "It was love, just like any other relationship," he said. "Social media pressure was normal but what made me stick with her was her good and loving personality. She is smart. I do not regret. It was good as it lasted." Speaking of Sidika publicising his low-key life, Chansa said, "Once you are a socialite, social media is your business, but she is real, she doesn’t fake anything. I’m proud of that. I am happy if she is happy." Sidika has in the past described her relationship with Chansa as toxic. She is now married to singer Brown Mauzo.
