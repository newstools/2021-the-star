Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has stopped illegal sand harvesting in Kivou River, Mwingi. This followed complaints from locals that the river is being ruined and their lives are at stake. Kitui county assembly passed a motion banning sand harvesting and charcoal burning in 2018. Speaking near Kivou River, Ngilu told the police to ensure no lorry goes to any river in Mwingi to ferry sand. "Protect our rivers, most rivers have been destroyed by sand harvesters," she told police officers. Ngilu said the rivers are the main source of water for most people in Kitui.Â She instead directed that harvesters fetch sand at Kiromboko, which neighbours Kiambere Dam in Mwingi West. "Anybody who wants to fetch sand will be permitted by the county government to fetch it at Kiromboko as there is a lot of it, but not in any other river," Ngilu said. Sand loaders raised concerns about losing jobs, but Ngilu promised to assist them through empowerment projects.
