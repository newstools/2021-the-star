The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received two VIP buses that were donated by the Government of the People's Republic of China through their Ambassador to Kenya Zhou Pingjian. The buses were received by the Foreign PS Amb Macharia Kamau on behalf of Foreign CS Raychelle Omamo on Thursday. They will facilitate the ministry's programs. Kamau said that the donation is a clear testament to the cordial and friendly relations that exist between the two countries and the good working relations between the Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Nairobi. “When I reflect on the cordial relations between our two countries that have grown and deepened over the years, I take cognizance of the mutual gains made on the basis of the Strategic Comprehensive Cooperation Partnership Agreement signed in 2016 between our two countries,” PS Kamau said. He also noted the commendable gains made under the Forum for China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The PS added that China has supported Kenya’s national development agenda through extensive infrastructure development that has raised the stature of Kenya as a regional transport and communications hub. He also expressed his gratitude to the government of China for the generous grant towards the construction of a new ministry headquarters. “I look forward to working with you to ensure the completion of this important project before the end of your tour of duty in Kenya.”
