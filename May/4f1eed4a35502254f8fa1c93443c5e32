Four-time Toronto Marathon winner Kennedy Mung'ara will be out to prove that age is just but a number when he chases a second Milano Marathon title on Sunday. Mung'ara, 48, is among the elite runners enlisted for the race alongside two-time world marathon champion Abel Kirui and Ethiopia’s Mekuant Ayenew and Seif Tura. Mung'ara said despite starting running a few years ago, he has achieved a lot and wants to prove that it is still possible for an athlete to compete deep into the 40s. “I started running very late, like 15 years ago, but I have achieved a few things that any athlete will want to achieve in life,” said Mungara, a former Nairobi Standard Chartered Marathon winner. The 2010 Singapore Marathon winner won the Milano title in 2015 but failed to defend it in 2016 after coming third but he is optimistic to register better results on his fourth attempt. “I have been preparing well for the race despite the coronavirus pandemic,” said Mung'ara, who is set to leave for Italy on Wednesday. The former Prague Marathon champion, who was part of the national marathon team to the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast — where he finished 10th, is still keen on doning the Kenyan stripes once again. “It was a privilege to compete for Kenya and I wish to get another chance to fly the Kenyan flag. The Commonwealth Games was my first time in Team Kenya team,” said the former Mumbai Marathon champion. 2012 Olympic Games marathon silver medalist, Kirui said: “I have lost many races including the Mumbai Marathon due to the pandemic and being entered in the Milano Marathon is god-sent." “I was preparing for Mumbai and I hope to transfer that form to this new opportunity. My fitness is good too,” he added. Kenyan Bornes Kitur will lead the women's chase alongside Ruti Aga, Azmera Gebru and Desu Sado.
