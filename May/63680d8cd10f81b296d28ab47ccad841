The cost of living increased slightly in May to highs seen in March on account of the increase in fuel costs. The monthly inflation data by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) shows the overall rate of inflation in May was 5.87 per cent, compared to the 5.76 per cent recorded in April According to the statistics body, the spike in the cost of living is greatly attributable to greater petrol costs during the month. The transport index for instance marked a 0.69 per cent increase after a 2.87 per cent rise in petrol pump prices on May 14. At the same time, the food index increased by 0.32 per cent as some food items marked increase in price. Even so, the cost of both food and non food products rose decimally during the month under review, piling pressure on families already struggling to make ends meet on subdued revenue. Most bread winners have lost revenue streams or with lucky ones operating on half income. Among the food items marking increased prices in the past month include onions, sukumawiki, cabbages, tomatoes and beef. The spike in the costs of the items was enough to offset price cool down in commodities such as oranges, potatoes and sugar. Housing and energy costs meanwhile eased by 0.15 per cent from a decrease in the prices of charcoal and electricity. The greater consumer prices are expected to weigh heavily on Kenyans amidst the continued stay of the Covid-19 pandemic.
