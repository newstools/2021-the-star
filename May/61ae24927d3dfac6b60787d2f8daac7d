With the reopening of schools, the Council of Governors has decried the lack of age appropriate face masks for ECDE learners. With the pandemic claiming lives, chairman Martin Wambora said since the reopening of schools, County Governments have continued to put in place measures to safeguard the health of all learners and teachers in ECDE and VTC centres. “...Inadequate face masks for teachers and support staff; ·  Inadequate hand washing stations in ECDE and VTCs,” Wambora said. He said the schools did not have sufficient disinfectants to ensure frequent and consistent fumigation of common areas and learning stations to prevent the spread of the virus. “We call upon the Ministry of Education to liaise with the MOH and Development Partners to provide adequate PPEs and sanitation materials to enhance the safety of learners and teachers,” he said. The third term beginning May 10 is the last stretch in the road to recover the time lost to school closures in March 2020. The term will run up to July 16. Learners expected to report to their schools are those in PP1 and PP2, Grade 1 to 3, Standard 5 to 7 and Form 1 to Form 3. Maintaining social distancing still remains a major challenge in most schools. Education CS George Magoha in January admitted public schools could not conform to the requirement, noting that masks would be relied upon in preventing infections. Magoha said that the ministry had requested the Treasury to  release a further Sh13 billion for the secondary schools and Sh2.8 billion for primary schools to cater for operations upon reopening. Wambora further said the total number of available beds in isolation centres were 7,963. Kenya has 373 ICU beds, the total number of available beds in the HDU facilities is 166. Cumulatively in 47 Counties, a total of 933,826 doses have been administered as follows:- Healthcare workers – 162,475,  Security – 79,376,  Teachers – 146,830, people above 58- 284,681 and other – 261,700.
