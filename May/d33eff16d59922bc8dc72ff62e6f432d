Kenya Morans will know their opponents in the FIBA Afro-Basket 2021 today (Friday). According to sources, the draws for the 16-team festival will be conducted today in Kigali, Rwanda. Morans made it to the Africa Championship for the first time in nearly three decades by shocking 11-time champions Angola 74-73 in their Group ‘B’ qualifiers in Yaounde, Cameroon in February. That historic triumph saw Kenya finish third in the group. They, however, lost 59-51 to leaders Senegal and 71-44 to bottom-placed Mozambique. Morans’ Australian coach Liz Mills, who returned home for a break, is expected in Nairobi this month to start preparations for the show. In an interview after qualifying, the tactician said she is not taking the team to Kigali to make up the numbers but to compete. “We do not know who is in our group but our first goal is to make it out of the first round,” she observed. Mills hopes to have an extended training camp and friendly matches against other teams headed to Afro-Basket prior to their departure to Kigali. Team captain Griffin Ligare also remained upbeat about Morans chances, saying if diaspora players are called up early and preparations start early, they have a chance of getting good results in Kigali.
