Former Kenya Harlequin and Homeboyz winger, Brian Wandera has fixed his sights on playing in the Super Rugby competition. Currently based in Australia, where he is pursuing a Masters Degree in Journalism, the 27-year-old who has played for the Kenya U-19s and Sevens teams spoke of settling into life down under. “So far, it has been good. It was quite challenging at first as the country went into lockdown but I am coping quite well and I have so far adapted to the new normal as it is," he noted. The Daystar University alumnus has been signed up by Melbourne club side, Box Hill. The team plays in the Dewar Shield, a feeder competition for the Melbourne Rebels who play in Super Rugby. The Super rugby competition brings together the top Australian rugby franchise  including the Brumbies, Waratahs, Western Force and Queensland Reds and Melbourne Rebels. Wandera hopes to make the Simbas squad for the 2023 World Cup qualifiers next year.  “ I would really like be party of the team going forward but with the nature of the pandemic, it will be tricky. However, we will cross that bridge when we get there,” said Wandera. Elsewhere,  Lionesses coach Felix Oloo is pleased with the improvements the team is making after dominating the Solidarity tournament in Tunisia over the weekend. The side beat Madagascar twice 19-0 and 22-0 and edged hosts Tunisia 10-5. The Lionesses are using the tournament as part of their preparations for the Olympics with their opponents using them as warm up for the Olympic repechage event set for Monaco next month. Oloo said it will be a good indicator for the team ahead  of the final warm up tournament in Los Angeles next month. “The team is making  steady progress. We face the same teams this weekend and we hope to be competitive and win all of them."
