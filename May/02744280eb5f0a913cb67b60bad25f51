Tottenham Hotspur interim manager Ryan Mason is reluctant to single out players for praise but said the performance of midfielder Dele Alli in Sunday’s 2-0 Premier League win over Wolverhampton Wanderers deserved special mention. Alli, often overlooked by former manager Jose Mourinho but who has started the last three games under Mason, showcased his attacking skills and tricks as well as getting stuck in with defensive duties to help Spurs climb to sixth in the Premier League. The 25-year-old will likely have made a good impression on England coach Gareth Southgate, who was among those watching at the stadium as he looks to put his squad together for the European Championship. “I can’t speak in terms of what Gareth is thinking,” Mason said of Alli. “But for me, Dele was excellent. I don’t really like singling out players but it’s hard not to. “He ran, he pressed, he created opportunities. I’m sure he’s disappointed he didn’t get a goal himself but it was an excellent No. 10 performance so I’m really pleased.” Sixth place should be enough to qualify for the Europa League next season, though Spurs are level on 59 points with West Ham United with two games left.
