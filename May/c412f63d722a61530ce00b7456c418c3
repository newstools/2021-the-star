Bomet county has gone digital in revenue collection, hoping to meet or exceed its target in the next financial year. The goal is Sh300 million. Revenue has been dropping over the years but the human factor is being minimised and loopholes for evasion or theft of cash sealed. Governor Hillary Barchok said while the county has the potential of collecting up to Sh700 million yearly, it hasn't been collecting not more than Sh250 million due to leakages from direct handling of cash. With the new system in place, Barchok said they aim to collect Sh300 million in the 2021-22 financial year. Speaking during the launch of the system being undertaken by JamboPay in partnership with Safaricom, Barchok said it will guarantee convenience and efficiency. He said for a long time clients had lost confidence in the revenue collection system as the money "gets lost due to direct contact between them and the revenue collectors. “The system will help us deliver on our promises to the residents even better by easing how they transact with us…payment of county fees and levies has now been simplified thanks to the new system,” the governor said Parking, market fees, paying invoices and cess are the main sources of revenue. Barchok said the new e-pay system will also improve internal efficiency, especially on reporting and transparency. JamboPay said the digital system will make the payment processes simple and secure for both the county and end customers. Safaricom will provide logistics as a network for the system. In the last financial year, the controller of budget said the county had surpassed its target by Sh500,000. Others present during the event were Deputy Governor Shadrack Rotich, finance CEC Andrew Sigei, among other chief officers and revenue officers. JamboPay and Safaricom representatives were also present (Edited by V. Graham)
