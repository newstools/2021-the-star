Kenya Women premier League (KWPL) champions Vihiga Queens head coach Alex Alumira has lamented against their hosts Eldoret Falcons who failed to show up in their first match after football resumption in the country. Despite being the hosts, Falcon, who are already relegated after failing to collect a single point, failed to turn up, handing the visitors a walkover in a match that was to be played at the Eldoret ASK Show ground. Alumira said he wanted to test the players' fitness after two months of inactivity  owing to suspension of all sporting activities in the country due to the coronavirus. “This was a bad idea for the hosts to donate easy  points. I really wanted to test my players in this first game after football resumption. It was an opportunity for both players and the technical bench to gel,” said Alumira at Eldoret ASK ground. After the walkover, Queens have cemented the top position in Zone B ahead of national play-offs. Queens now lead with 31 points  seven ahead of second-placed Wadadia with three matches to go. “We have sealed the top position and that is a good idea but we did not want to get free points,” said Alumira. Captain Enez Mango said they wanted to play at least a game as part of their preparations for the remaining duels. Queens next face Nakuru West at Bukhungu Stadium, Kisumu Starlets (Moi Stadium, Kisumu)  and Trans Nzoia Falcons back at home. “We have FKF Cup match and Cecafa matches ahead of us but our main aim is to win the league first,” added Alumira. xother matches, Wadadia edged out visiting Oserian Ladies 2-1 at Mumias Complex to move into the second position with 22 points from 11 matches ahead of third-placed Nakuru Queens.
