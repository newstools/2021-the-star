The government should put up sanitary towel dispensers in all public schools just as there are condom dispensers in hospitals. Nyeri Deputy Governor Caroline Karugu says the move will help keep girls in schools and improve hygiene. She said the dispensers should be put in washrooms where girls can pick them whenever need be. Karugu said such a move would provide a sustainable solution to problems of sanitary towels among girls from poor backgrounds. “The government needs to have a good programme that ensures that we have sanitary towels dispensers within all the washrooms of these young girls to ensure menstrual hygiene is upheld,” Karugu said. She spoke at DEB Muslim Primary School in Nyeri town on Friday during celebrations to mark the World Menstrual Hygiene Day 2021. This year’s theme was Action and Investment in Menstrual Hygiene and Health. Karugu donated sanitary towels to about 250 girls to last them for two months. “The aim of this day is to destigmatise the taboo that comes with menstruation for our young girls and to encourage them that this is indeed an important stage of life and a stage that should be more celebrated and less frowned about,” she said. She added, “We have taken time to also speak to them and mentor them about being women of substance and being women of purpose and we hope this is a message that can go across the entire county especially to our girls.” She said many girls fell pregnant during the Covid -19 lockdown after engaging in sex for pads. Karugu said some girls agree to sex so they can get money to buy towels. She said about 15 per cent of girls, especially those from needy backgrounds and slums have had problems affording sanitary towels.  Edited by P.O
