Police in Nyamira are hunting for two men suspected to have defiled two minors. Two other men already are in custody after the attack on Thursday. It is alleged the suspects ferried the minors to an unknown destination where they were made intoxicated before they were defiled. The girls' grandmother had sent them to Ekerenyo shopping centre. The girls were on their way back home at about 6.30 pm they met two boda boda riders who were familiar to them. They offered the girls a ride home. The girls got onto the motorbikes but the riders took a different direction, not toward their homes but toward Nyakongo. Along the way, the riders were joined by two friends. They ended up in neighbouring village of Obwari within Nyamira North. County commissioner Amos Mariba said the girls ended up in a house where they were forced to drink alcohol before they were defiled. The house belongs to one of the boda boda riders who offered the minors a ride, Mariba said. “Early Friday morning at about 6am, the little girls were dragged and dumped along a murram road. A good Samaritan took them to Ekerenyo Subcounty Hospital where they are in stable condition,” Mariba said in a statement. The two accomplices they met along the way have been arrested and are in police custody. Mariba said police are doing everything possible to arrest the main suspects. (Edited by V. Graham).
