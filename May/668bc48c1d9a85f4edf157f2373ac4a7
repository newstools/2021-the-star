Diamond's manager Babu Tale says he is still grieving his wife, who died last year, living behind four children. "My wife told me not to remarry. I remember that day when I was in the hospital with her," he posted. "She told me she was tired of being sick and she held my hand and told me, 'I’m leaving, take care of the kids and don’t remarry.'" "I am still mourning my late wife. When I am done and ready, I will marry again." He then rubbished social media claims that he is planning to remarry soon. "I believe the institution of marriage is a very important thing that deserves respect. I got married a long time ago by Allah's words," he said. "My wife's shadow lives with me, so I'll wait until the shadow disappears then I'll remarry."
