Ali Kiba's wife Amina Khalef has hinted that she has welcomed a second child. Via her Instagram stories on Saturday, Amina shared a photo of a newborn’s hand without a caption. She has been rumoured to be pregnant for several months. Kiba and Amina’s first child Keyaan was born in 2019 just a few months after their grand wedding. Amina said she met Kiba on a plane, but they never exchanged a word. “The first time we met was aboard a plane, but we did not speak. The second time, a relative introduced us since they knew each other. That is when we started dating up till now,” she said. Speculation about their marriage hitting the rocks have also gone viral since Amina moved back to her hometown of Mombasa with their child. Ali Kiba's mother confirmed in an interview that the singer and his Kenyan wife Amina Khalef had taken a break from each other
