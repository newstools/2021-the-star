The government has extended the nationwide night curfew by another 60 days — until July 27. An April 12 gazette notice by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i extended the previous 10pm to 4am curfew period to May 29. The current extension was made a day earlier on May 28. “There shall be no public gatherings, processions or movement either alone or as a group during the period of the curfew except as shall be permitted by writing, by an officer in charge of the police in a county or a police officer in charge of the police in a division/sub-county,” the May 28 gazette notice reads. The measures are meant to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic which by Saturday last week had claimed 3,141 lives from 170,485 confirmed cases. Earlier, government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna told the Star that President Uhuru Kenyatta extended the curfew indefinitely in his Labour Day speech at State House. “The President’s speech overrides everything, it supersedes everything and that order still stands,” Oguna said in response to queries about the status of the curfew after May 29. Uhuru had on May 1 lifted a travel ban into and out of Kiambu, Kajiado, Machakos, Nairobi and Nakuru counties. The five counties had on March 26 been classified as disease infected zone due to a high prevalence of Covid-19. The curfew in the zone was revised to start at 8pm and end at 4am. The rest of the country remained indefinitely on the 10pm to 4am curfew.  (edited by o. owino)
