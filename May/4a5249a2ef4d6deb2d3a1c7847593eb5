West Bromwich Albion manager Sam Allardyce said a refereeing “blunder” and a dubious Video Assistant Referee (VAR) decision were to blame for his side’s 2-1 Premier League defeat by Liverpool on Sunday. West Brom striker Hal Robson-Kanu scored the opener before Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah equalised and goalkeeper Alisson Becker netted an injury-time header to snatch a last-gasp victory against Allardyce’s relegated side. Allardyce was unhappy with Mike Dean’s decision to award Liverpool a free-kick after the referee had collided with Fabinho, and also questioned why VAR had cancelled out Kyle Bartley’s goal when he was onside. “We didn’t need the officials or VAR to go against us and they’ve gone against us on two occasions and it’s the main reason why we’ve lost this game,” Allardyce said. “The referee should give a drop ball, not a free-kick. That’s a complete blunder as far as the rules go.” Bartley looked as if he had put West Brom back in front when he netted from close range following a corner but while he was onside team mate Matt Phillips was adjudged to be standing in the eyeline of Alisson and was ruled offside. “The biggest blow that we got was the second goal we scored being disallowed,” added Allardyce. “I thought it was a perfectly good goal with no interference whatsoever. It needed to stay as a goal. “The lad who scored the goal was miles onside and the lad who was offside was nowhere near the ball.” West Brom host West Ham United on Wednesday before travelling to Leeds United on Sunday for the final game of the season.
