Tanzania President Samia Suluhu on Wednesday clarified that the two-day state visit to Kenya is her first since sworn in as the President of the neighbouring country. Addressing a joint sitting of Parliament, Suluhu said her visit to Uganda was not a state visit but was for the signing of a pipeline deal. Suluhu said since taking over office, she has received many invitations from different counties but settled on Kenya given the historical ties the two counties have enjoyed over the years. “I was in Uganda to sign a deal but my official state visit is to Kenya,” Suluhu said amidst applause from the lawmakers. “I have received many invitations but I decided to start with Kenya because of the histirical ties between the two countries.” Todays's address - she noted - was her first time to address a joint sitting of Parliament. The visiting head of state also lauded President Uhuru for standing with Tanzania when they lost President John Magufuli. "I am delighted to get the opportunity to address the joint sitting of Senate and National Assembly of Kenya," she said. Suluhu has extended a special invitation to President Uhuru Kenyatta to be the main guest as they celebrate 60 years of independence in December. She said they will be honoured to have Uhuru as the main guest during the celebrations. Suluhu becomes the second visiting head of state to address a joint sitting of parliament since independence. Former Tanzania President Jakaya Kikwete was the first visiting President to address a joint sitting of Parliament in October 2015.
