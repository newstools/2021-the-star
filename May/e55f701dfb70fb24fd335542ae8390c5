Sukari Industries Company has procured a motorboat to assist Ndhiwa residents and traders crossing River Kuja following the collapse of Oria-Riat bridge. The Oria-Riat bridge, which was constructed in 1980, connected Oria market in Migori to markets in Ndhiwa, Homa Bay county. The bridge caved in under the weight of a trailer which plunged into the river with a load of sugarcane last week. After the collapse of the bridge, thousands of traders were unable to access the markets across the two counties. Ndhiwa MP Martin Owino received the boat from Sukari Industries general manager David Okoth on Saturday. “The boat has a capacity of 10 passengers and it will be transporting people across the river free of charge,” Okoth said. Owino said he had talked to the police who assured him that at least three officers would be deployed to control the use of the motorboat. The MP said this will prevent a stampede as people seek to board the boat. He said he has negotiated for Sh30 million from the government to construct a footbridge across the river. The project will be implemented by the Kenya Rural Roads Authority. “The footbridge will be a temporary measure because it will only allow pedestrians and boda boda riders to cross the river. We will request more funds from the government to enable us to construct a permanent bridge here,” the legislator said. Edited by A.N
