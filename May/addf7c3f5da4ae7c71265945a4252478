Kenya under-21 hockey captain Ivan Ludiali has challenged Kenya Hockey Union to consider putting the team in a residential camp and organise friendly matches to enhance players' fitness levels. The junior side is looking forward to theÂ  Africa Junior Cup slated for August 14-22 in Namibia. The week-long event will act as qualifiers to the Junior World Cup set for December in India. With the team currently in a non-residential training camp at the City Park Stadium, Ludiali believes secluding the team will help the players concentrate on the game and bond as a group. "The only way to get the best out of the group is to put the team into a residential camp. The mood, atmosphere and levels of concentration are totally different in a residential training camp as opposed to when players are in a non-residential camp," said Ludiali, who was part of the national team which had an unsuccessful campaign at the 2010 Tokyo Olympic Games qualifiers in South Africa two years ago. "We also need build-up matches against superior teams even though training with the senior national team is a bonus. We have to utilise whatever we have to ensure we are match-ready before August," said the Maseno school alumnus. Ludiali, who plays for KHU Premier League side Western Jaguars, was part of the African Youth Olympic Qualifiers team in Algiers, Algeria that subsequently played at the Youth Olympic Games in Buenos, Argentina 2018. "In 2018, the preparations were relatively better and more organised with the residential training camp. It is the sought of preps that the team urgently needs," reflected the 20-year old.
