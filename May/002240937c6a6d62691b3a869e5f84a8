Jubilee Party has announced that the party's vice chair David Murathe has not resigned from his duties. In a statement released on Wednesday, Jubilee communications director Albert Memusi said that they would like to clarify that such reports of Murathe resigning are false. "Murathe remains our able Vice Chair and continues to carry out his duties in that capacity, working diligently to fulfill his mandate as provided for in the party constitution," Memusi said. Memusi also urged members of the public to treat any documents, reports or communication purporting to convey Murathe's resignation with the contempt they deserve. "Any official communication about changes in the Jubilee Party leadership will be communicated through the official Party organs, as is the norm, and as is articulated in the Jubilee Party Constitution," he said. He also clarified that the party is unequivocally focused on fulfilling the pledges made to the people of Kenya, and completing the journey of transformation. Last week, Jubilee Party leaders demanded radical changes ahead of 2022. A section of senior members who spoke to the Star on May 21, called for a comprehensive overhaul of the secretariat to bring on board fresh blood to give the party a new face. Among the demands made by the members to party leader President Uhuru Kenyatta is the removal of vice chairman David Murathe and secretary general Raphael Tuju. They blamed the two for being the main stumbling block to the growth and vibrancy of the party that of late has become a theatre of fights.
