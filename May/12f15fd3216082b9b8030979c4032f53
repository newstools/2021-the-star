Deputy President William Ruto has called for a national conversation on how to deal with the problems the country is facing. The DP said in the face of the disruptions posed by Covid-19, maybe God was asking the leaders to come together and reason on how to manage the situation. Ruto said it was time Kenyans took up the words of a bishop who asked that the country try the Jerusalema dance. “So much has happened. But as things stand today, Tangatanga tours are not there and the reggae has also stopped. We thus need to do something together,” the DP said. Ruto reminisced the last prayer meeting where ODM leader Raila Odinga, who “in an uncharacteristic manner read a verse” calling on people to reason together. “Maybe God is saying we come reason together,” Ruto said, adding that the same message was passed during his daughter’s nuptials.
