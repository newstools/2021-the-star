Singer Bahati has offered to help an upcoming artiste identified as Stephen after his public appeal for help. Through his Instagram page, Bahati said, "I just saw this. Unfortunately, I closed down the record signing label almost a year ago. But the best thing I will do is make sure I sponsor him to record at least two songs to kickstart his career." Adding, "My team cannot get him on phoneâ€¦ Anyone close to him, pass him this information. He can DM our fanpage @TeamBahati. Our producer is waiting to record him. All the best as he pursues his music career." The 23-year-old had confessed his admiration for Bahati, saying he would welcome any help from him. While closing his EMB Records label last year, Bahati lashed out at artistes trying to bring him down after he uplifted them.
