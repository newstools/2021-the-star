A truck driver has been committed to serving a one-year sentence in jail after failing to raise a fine of Sh500,000. Amon Kipngetich was charged for evading the Athi River Weighbridge, which is contrary to the East African Community Vehicle Load Control Act of 2016. The East African Community Vehicle Load Control Act allows the community to jointly fight the deterioration of the paved road network due to overloading. Following the ruling, Kenya National Highways Authority said that the damage due to overloading is a costly consequence to the taxpayer. KeNHA said that a truck that is 10 per cent loaded more than it should cause 50 per cent more damage on the road than a compliant truck. Earlier this year, the authority said that transporters who overload their vehicles will be prosecuted and pay fines of up to Sh835,000. KeNHA officer in charge of axle load control Dennis Cheruiyot said that under regional laws, overloading culprits will pay even more penalties provided there is evidence. “Under the Traffic Act, any overload of above 10,000 kilos attracts a penalty of up to Sh400,000. But under regional laws, which we are also enforcing, an overload of 10,000 kilos attracts a fine of Sh835,000. So, we are now enforcing more punitive measures,” Cheruiyot said. He said KeNhA would remain committed to its mandate to develop, rehabilitate, manage and maintain all national trunk roads. Trunk roads are those used for long-distance travel. The high penalties imposed against overloading are meant to deter transporters from carrying excess weight.
