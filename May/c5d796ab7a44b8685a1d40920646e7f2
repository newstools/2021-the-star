Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has called for change in operations in Jubilee Party following major loses in the recently concluded by-elections. Jubilee party suffered major setback in its perceived strongholds after losing in the Juja, Rurii and Bonchari by-elections. Kinyanjui now says its time for Jubilee to look into its 'flawed' nomination processes which has left a bitter taste on its supporters who will in turn retaliate in the 2022 elections. "In recent by elections, our promise to uphold the will of the people and respect their democratic right, has been violated at the nomination level resulting in the entry of unpopular candidates," Kinyanjui said in a statement on Thursday. "The outcome of recent by elections show a growing disconnect with the public feelings. We cannot address this challenge by denying its existence." The legislator warned against imposing candidates because of connections emotions or economic gain. "Consequently, we strongly believe it is time to institute drastic and wide-ranging changes at the party helm; to inject fresh blood and rejuvenate the dreams of it’s support base. This is a necessary bitter pill that we must swallow," he said. According to Kinyanjui, Jubilee party is full of persons who add no value to the party. "As an ardent supporter of the party, I can confirm the huge disappointment with the recent political developments," he said. "Politics is a science driven by facts that are verifiable and we must treat it as such." This comes hours after Jubilee party secretary General announced that the party has opted for interviews rather than conducting nominations for aspirants of the Muguga ward and kiambaa constituency by-election. All aspirants for the seats were asked to present themselves at the party headquarters on Saturday for the interview. Tuju said in a statement that successful  candidates shall be presented with nomination certificate in accordance with the party Nomination Rules2010.
