A Nairobi-based carpenter who failed to deliver a Sh78,000 dining table has been charged with obtaining the money under false pretences. Walter Ouma appeared before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa on Wednesday. Court papers say he obtained the money from Mary Ongayo Achieng on diverse dates between February 15 and March 15 at his workshop in Riruta, Dagoreti. According to the police, Achieng had identified the items he wanted and an agreement was made between her and Ouma. He was to make the items for Sh100,000 and Achieng paid a deposit of Sh48,000 before the job commenced. She paid an additional Sh30,000. When she visited the workshop later, she found that Ouma had not started working on the items. Achieng reported Ouma to the police after several failed attempts to get the items. Ouma denied the charges.Â He was released on a Sh100,000 bond or cash bail of Sh30,000. The case will be mentioned on May 17.
