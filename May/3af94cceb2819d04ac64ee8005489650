The ODM Party has recommended the removal of Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo from the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee of the National Assembly. Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang will replace Otiende at JLAC chaired by Kangema MP Muturi Kigano. Otiende is currently the Deputy Chairman of the JLAC which deliberated on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendments) Bill, 2020. "We have recommended replacing Otiende with TJ Kajwang'. We are making changes," Mbadi told Star on phone. The minority leader said the changes will be made during today's sitting."The Selection Committee already approved. We are taking the matter to the floor this evening." But the Rarieda MP later went on Twitter and blamed "schemers" for being behind the move saying he will "take it in grace and stride". The House later in the afternoon approved a motion seeking the reconstitution of some committees including the JLAC where Amollo was replaced.
