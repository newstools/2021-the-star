The Building Bridges Initiative secretariate has asked the courts to consider the mood of the public in its ruling on the pending cases challenging the initiative. In a statement on Wednesday, BBI secretariate co-chair Dennis Waweru and his counterpart Junet Mohamed said that the case is the only barrier between the initiative and the referendum. “The focus now turns to our courts, which are expected to deliver judgment on the cases before them relating to the BBI process…we urge them to be cognizant of the public mood and to especially pay attention to the voice of the people, who have overwhelmingly spoken since the onset of the process,” the secretariat said. The secretariate has hoped that the courts will allow Kenyans to have their final say on the proposed constitutional amendments through a national referendum. The secretariate has also lauded Members of the National Assembly and Senators for voting for the Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2020 unanimously. “We applaud the honourable members for affirming the will of the people…this is a ringing endorsement of the proposed constitutional amendments by the peoples’ representatives in both Houses, and it affirms that the Parliamentarians heeded the voice of the people.” About 60 per cent of the MPs voted for the bill as well as 78 per cent of Senators. The secretariate has also called upon IEBC to get ready for a fair, free and transparent referendum. “We challenge the electoral body to regain the trust of Kenyans by exhibiting professionalism, efficiency, and neutrality as it embarks on discharging its mandate and deliver a stellar referendum in July, 2021.”
