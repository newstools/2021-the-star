The latest report by the Human Rights Watch titled ‘A Threshold Crossed: Israel Authorities and the Crimes of Apartheid and Persecution’ indicts Israel for being an apartheid state that is committing crimes against humanity. Israel might want to continue with its standard performance of rejecting such charges and boasting of being the only thriving democracy in the Middle East, but it is becoming increasingly clear that it can no longer escape the torch of justice however deceptive its propaganda. Seeing the Israeli Foreign ministry fling its cheap denunciations at the HRW report, a very credible and American global human rights organisation that is well-known for its thorough investigations and impartiality, is the height of absurdity and denial. The sooner Israel acknowledges its cruel oppression and dominance over Palestinians the better for peace and territorial justice. This is the second severe indictment of Israel since January after the prominent Israeli rights organisation B’Tselem publicised the same disclosure that Israel is an apartheid state. In March, the International Criminal Court also entered the scene and opened investigations on possible Israeli war crimes against Palestinians. It was however horrifying that both Israel and the United States protested against the ICC move as if insinuating that Israel is above international law. The automatic backing by the United States obstructs peace and justice for Palestinians who continue to struggle under the interminable military occupation and apartheid of Israel that has no bounds even now with a pandemic and the ongoing holy month of Ramadhan. But, as more facts emerge on Israel’s colossal scale of brutalities, which are often deceptively blamed on the Palestinian victims resisting apartheid, change and justice will be inescapable.
