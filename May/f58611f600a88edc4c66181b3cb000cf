Former Kenya Rugby Sevens coach Benjamin Ayimba has died. Ayimba has been at Nairobi hospital where he has been undergoing treatment for cerebral malaria and breathed his last on Friday evening. He commenced treatment late last year and has been admitted to the High Dependency Unit. Before transitioning into coaching, Ayimba had a glittering career at Kenya 15s and 7s international. He skippered Kenya Cup side Impala Saracens to the Enterprise Cup and Kenya Cup after a 26-year drought. As the Sevens' coach, Ayimba's crowning moment was in 2016 when he led the team to their first World Sevens Series title where they beat Fiji 30-7 at the Singapore Sevens. Prior to that, Ayimba had led the national team to the semis of the Dubai Sevens and an appearance in the finals of the Adelaide Sevens, both in 2009. The Maseno School alumnus was early this year retained as the deputy coach of Kenya Harlequins, under head coach Antoine Plasman of Belgium.
