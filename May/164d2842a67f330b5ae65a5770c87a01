Tanzanian singer Zuchu has thrown shade at Diamond Platnumz’s half-sister Queen Darleen. Just like Zuchu, Darleen is also signed under WCB. Tanzanian celebrity Masha Love went viral after claiming she and Queen Darleen have been seeking witchcraft to bring Zuchu down in her career. Zuchu has now taken to social media to slam Queen Darleen for her alleged actions. “One Of the biggest lessons I’ve learnt from my journey is that the bigger you grow, the fake people around you become. Fame has a price and in most cases it is losing people. People u possibly thought u knew or trusted become strangers in no time. Wow. But hey. It's called real life.” Zuchu was signed under WCB early last year and has blown up with hits like ‘Sukari’ and ‘Number One'.
