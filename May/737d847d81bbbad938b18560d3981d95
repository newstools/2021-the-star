Kakamega Homeboyz tactician Nicholas Muyoti has urged his key striker, Allan Wanga, to shelve any plans he had of quitting football at the end of the season. Muyoti is convinced the former Kenyan international still has a three-year lifespan left on his career before he can call it a day. The 35-year-old centre-forward had had expressed an urge to retire at the end of the current season to concentrate on his job at the Kakamega County government. Muyoti called on Wanga to stay put in the club and help his teammates battle for their maiden Football Kenya Federation Premier League title before he can think of leaving. "We had agreed with Wanga that he will only start planning for  his exit when we clinch the KPL trophy. For now, I will treat Wanga's retirement stories as hearsay," Muyoti said on the phone. “Wanga should look at his legacy as an individual in the world of soccer, then the pace he is setting for the club in terms of fighting for the trophies,” he said. Muyoti said Wanga is still strong and energetic enough to feature in some more competitive games, adding that he only came to learn about the striker's plans through media reports. "I haven't received official communication from him but I have just heard it from the media," Muyoti added. Earlier, Wanga had said he intends to hang up his boots while still active in the world of soccer, and urged veterans to consider handing the button to budding footballers as a way of creating new opportunities. "For me,  I will prefer to hang boots when I am still active in the world of soccer to give an opportunity for the upcoming players," he said. "When we keep ourselves on the pitch up to 40 years, we deny  the young generation a chance to showcase their talent," he added.
