DP William Ruto has continued his celebrations after BBI was declared unconstitutional, null and void. Ruto who neither supported BBI or rejected it said Kenyans should now put their focus on vaccination drive. The DP and his team had launched aggressive attacks on the BBI. The DP, who was shoved out of the heart of government following his anti-BBI rhetoric against President Uhuru Kenyatta's wish, had been reduced to alone-ranger in the battle against law change. "Our democracy is anchored on the rule of Law, constitutionalism, separation of  of power and respect for independent institutions," Ruto said. On his Twitter account on Friday, Ruto said all patriotic citizens must defend these tenets just like Judiciary did. "Now let's focus on Covid vaccination, economic recovery,  the big4 and stay United," he said. After the ruling on Thursday night, Ruto showed how much he was content with the outcome of the ruling. Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Chacha Mwita, and Teresia Matheka unanimously ruled that the entire process that the BBI team followed in coming up with the constitutional amendment was unconstitutional. Judges said that the president, the government, or any state organ cannot initiate a popular initiative in the constitution. They said that the Constitution of Kenya Amendment Bill 2020 was a process that was initiated by the president. DP Ruto was sidelined in the BBI process and his allies in both the National Assembly and the Senate voted against the bill. Right from its inception, Ruto had argued that BBI was an exclusive affair by two people to bulldoze amendments to the Constitution at the expense of other Kenyans.
