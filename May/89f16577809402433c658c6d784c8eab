Education CS George Magoha is set to release the KCSE results today. The candidates who sat the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in March and April will receive their results today. Announcement of the results will pave the way for admission to universities, colleges and technical institutions. Knec data show that 752,933 candidates were registered to sit this year's KCSE exam in 10,437 centres. Last week, the marking of the exam ended with some examiners staging protests over their dues. Marking started immediately after the exam was concluded on April 16. It involved at least 27,284 examiners and was conducted in about 33 national schools distributed in the eight regions, formerly provinces. However, the process witnessed several complaints about poor pay and delayed allowances. Examiners at Moi Girls and State House Girls protested against unpaid allowances due at the end of the marking exercise. This drew the attention of a trade union. Magoha had promised that the marking of the 2020 KCSE exam will be released by May 10.
