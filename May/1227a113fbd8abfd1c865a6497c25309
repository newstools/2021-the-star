Plans to launch flights to Hargeisa, Somaliland are currently on hold pending requisite clearance and approvals, Kenya Airways has announced. "We currently do not have any flights in operation, contrary to information circulating on social media," Kenya Airways said in a statement. This comes as the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority suspended all flights to and from Somalia in a notice to airmen. In the notice, the Kenyan government did not give any reasons for the action. The ban came days after Qatar brokered a breakthrough that saw Mogadishu restore diplomatic ties with Nairobi. Somalia restored diplomatic relations with Kenya after five months following mediation by Qatar led by Emir Sheikh Tamim Al Thani. Somalia's Ministry of Information said they were resuming the relations “in keeping with the interests of good neighbourliness”. “The two governments agree to keep friendly relations between the two countries on the basis of principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence,” the statement said.
