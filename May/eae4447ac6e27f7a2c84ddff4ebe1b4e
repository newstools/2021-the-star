Norwegian based accelerator Pangea has unveiled a scale-up program offering private funding of up to Sh300million to enable local startups accelerate their enterprises to the next level. The support will further enable the startups to move up the ladder from the Seed level to Series A. “Out of the local start-ups that have raised more than $1 million, only 6 per cent have local founders while the rest are founded by expatriates. As an accelerator, we are looking to change this narrative and enable more African entrepreneurs to gain access to capital,” said CEO and Cofounder of Pangea Accelerator Jonas Tesfu. Like in many other African countries, Kenyan startups face a major challenge in finding investors to fund their businesses, a task considered difficult and time-consuming. “It is also on this backdrop that as Pangea we step in and help bridge the gap between entrepreneurs and investors, and we provide them with the skills they need to take their start-ups to the next level” said Tesfu. Successful applicants of the program will also receive tailored coaching sessions to suit their specific business requirements and optimal matching of investors to fund their businesses. This is in addition to coaching relevant to the needs of their businesses and funding from different investors. The scale-up program will be 18 months long to ensure that the selected start-ups will have all the support they need. Entrepreneurs looking for an opportunity to scale up their business can apply for funding and business support from the the program's website, www.pangeaa.com/scale-up-program/ .
