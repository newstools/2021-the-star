Kenya Cup League will resume on June 12 following the resumption of sports activities in the country. Kenya Cup caucus chairman, Xavier Makuba, said after consultation with the league and fixtures committee, they decided to have the league resume next month with teams training for five weeks before action proper. "Teams have resumed training and are getting back to fitness following the one-month suspension. They will, of course, take time to adjust to ensure everyone is fit and raring to go,"added Makuba. After resumption, the league will run for three months till September before paving way for a break and the start of the Impala Floodlight in the same month. I hope we can finish the campaign without any interruptions and have the champion crowned," said Makuba. He said it was highly unlikely that the Sevens circuit will be played alongside  the league. "I don't see how we will play the league and the Sevens circuit at the same time with all the restrictions and protocols involved. I don't see it happening this year," he said.  This year's campaign will have no promotion or relegation. By the time of stoppage, Kabras were leading the standings with 15 points followed by KCB and Menengai Oilers respectively. Former champions Nondies were yet to play a game before the suspension of the  sport in the country. Makuba said he expects a competitive league campaign based on what we saw in the opening first month of the season. "All teams are starting from the same level and with this interruptions, people have to go back to the drawing board and re-evaluate," he said. Elsewhere, Kenya Rugby Union have opened a temporary (loan) transfer window ahead of a proposed return to action in the Kenya Cup which was suspended on March 26 following the Presidential directive for all sporting activities. The transfer window opened on Wednesday and runs until June 4.
