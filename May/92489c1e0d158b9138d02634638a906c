Kiambu Governor James Nyoro has denied he led a team that disrupted tallying of votes in Juja on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, he accused the opposing side of shouting his side down when they demanded that all votes cast be counted. He alleged that votes from two polling stations where the Jubilee candidate had a strong showing were not counted. "Votes from Gachororo were thrown in the field and not counted," Nyoro said. "I condemn in the strongest terms possible the insinuation that I'm a violent person. I have never been violent even during my campaigns." "We were not involved in creating disturbance at the tallying center. It is our opponents who were shouting at us." Earlier, IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati said he will write to DPP Nordin Haji to prosecute Nyoro and his team over the chaos witnessed in Juja on Tuesday night. Speaking on Citizen TV on Wednesday, Chebukati said Haji should arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of the chaos. The electoral agency was forced to suspend vote tallying in Juja constituency after  chaos erupted. Chebukati blamed Nyoro for disrupting the process. The vote tallying resumed on Wednesday, 10 hours after the suspension. "At around 10:20pm tonight there was disruption of the tallying process at Mang’u HighSchool Tallying center in Juja Constituency by a group of individuals led by the Kiambu County Governor Mr James Nyoro," Chebukati  said. Three men had stormed the center at Mang'u High school and caused a commotion raising concerns from parties involved. Police intervened and whisked the three away. However a melee ensued between Jubilee candidate Susan Njeri's supporters led by Nyoro and Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba and PEP candidate George Koimburi's supporters led by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata and Witeithie Ward MCA Julius Macharia.
