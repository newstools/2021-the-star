by WANGECHI WANG'ONDU Kirinyaga residents have been urged to collect their Huduma cards. County commissioner Jim Njoka says 86,272 cards have been processed for residents of Kirinyaga. Only 57,696 cards have been collected by their owners. A total of 513,106 residents registered for the cards in 2019. Njoka said those whose cards are ready have been informed to collect them via short text mobile messages. “Through the rapid initiative strategy, we have been able to distribute about 70 per cent of the cards that we received .We will not tire to reach out to residents through various public forums," Njoka said. The official said the cards are very important. Kirinyaga has 13 collections stations across the county out of which five are main distribution centers in all the five sub-counties. The rest are in Sagana, Thiba,  Murinduko, Kiamutugu, Kagumo, Kibingoti, Mwea West and Mwea East. Njoka praised chiefs and their assistants for their efforts in mobilising residents to collect their cards. He said the administrators have educated the people on the need to get the cards. "They will soon start tracing those yet to collect their cards in their homes,@ Njoka said. He cited reluctance among residents as one of the challenges the distribution team is facing. “Some people don’t simply want to come for their cards and that’s why in the near future the local administrators will be tracing them to their homes. I want to appeal to all county residents to take this programme very seriously because there is a reason why the government launched the Huduma Namba registration.” Njoka said some people who registered for the card in Kirinyaga have also moved to other counties. He urged them to return and collect the documents.  Edited by P.O
