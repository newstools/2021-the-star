President Uhuru Kenyatta's motorcade was on Wednesday forced to reduce its high speed and eventually stop following an unusual scenario. The president was on his way to open the Neema abattoir in Lucky Summer, Nairobi County before the incident. In a viral video shared through social media, a man is seen moving from the crowd that was standing along the road to wave to the president as he passes by. He waited for the chase cars that were in front to pass before he suddenly moved and blocked the presidentâ€™s care. Immediately, the presidential guards on the motorcade stopped and moved with speed to arrest the man. The police arrested the man but the incident did not make the president stop to address the cheering crowd. He instead waved at them. The incident comes after last Thursday's scenario where man was arrested in Lamu as he tried to force his way to Uhuru while he made his speech during the official opening of the Lamu Port. Police identified him as James Kinyua Wamuchomba who comes from the area. He was armed with his National Identification card and is said to have wanted to express his protests over the lack of jobs at the new port. In his address at Neema, Uhuru said that the government will continue sourcing for new markets and expanding existing ones so as to enable farmers to sell their livestock at good prices. Neema is a Sh300 million slaughterhouse owned by 3,000 livestock farmers and has an installed daily slaughter capacity of 12, 000 and 6,000 small stock (goats/sheep) for local and export markets respectively. Over 85 percent of their products are sold overseas. The President said the recent reopening of the Kenya Meat Commission was part of a long-term plan by the Government to cushion livestock farmers from exploitative middlemen.
