A senior Immigration officer was on Sunday shot dead while on a morning run along Lokichogio-Nadapal road. The officer identified as Phillip Sitienei, died on the spot after he was shot severally by unknown attackers. Confirming the incident, the National Police Service said the officer succumbed to multiple gunshots on the leg shoulder and head. The Service said a thorough investigation has been launched to catch the assailants. "We condemn this heinous act with the strongest words possible. No stone will be left unturned until we get the killers of the Civil Servant," the NPS said. This comes just hours after a video surfaced of a police officer pleading with the Inspector General to approve her resignation. She noted that such frustrations in the police force were leading to the deaths of officers who either committed suicide or resorted to killing others. The police woman said she had written resignation letters but they were yet to reach the IG. "Sir, kindly allow me to resign peacefully from the police officer post because I can thrive elsewhere. Even if it means, resigning without pay, I will not mind," she said. "I just want a chance to resign peacefully. I have attached several letters meant for the IG but they never get to him. That is why police officers get frustrated to a point of committing suicide or killing themselves, something I cannot do," she said.
