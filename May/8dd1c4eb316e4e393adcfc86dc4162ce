The ongoing rains have cut off roads and flooded scores of farms in Naivasha, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction. Residents fear more losses as more rainfall is expected in the coming days. Many families have been displaced. The most affected is Mirera estate off the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road, with flash floods from neighbouring areas of Nyamathi blamed for the crisis. Water levels in Lake Naivasha rose by 6cm in the last three days, with projections that they could rise further due to the ongoing rains in the catchment areas. Farmer Njoki Nyanjui said the flooding started on Sunday following heavy rains in the upper catchment area. She said that the gushing waters flooded their farms and roads, leaving a trail of destruction and cutting off roads. “We have been left counting losses running into thousands of shillings as our farms are flooded and all crops destroyed,” she said on Tuesday. Njoki called on the county government to address drainage terming it a major challenge. “Some of the drainage systems have been blocked by individuals and the only solution is opening them up to allow the water flow into Lake Naivasha,” she said. Lake Naivasha Water Resource Users Association chairman Enock Kiminta noted that the rains had pushed up the water levels in the lake. He said water levels stood at 1890.97m above sea level, a rise by 6cm from Sunday with projections that it would increase. “Due to the ongoing rains, we have seen the water levels in the lake rise sharply and we are calling on communities around the water body to relocate to higher grounds,” Kiminta said. Red Cross is a message to residents said there were indications that the ongoing rains could cause flooding in the region. “This is to request you to move to higher grounds once the water levels start rising,” the message reads.
