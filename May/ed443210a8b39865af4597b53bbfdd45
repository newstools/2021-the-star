Competition in the domestic aviation passenger business is becoming intense with the entry of new players keen to tap into a growing middle-class that is embracing flying. Aviation company, 748 Air Services is the latest entrant in the Nairobi-Kisumu route, currently served by national carrier-Kenya Airways, Safarilink and Jambojet. It is now eyeing the Mombasa and Diani routes after launching passenger fights on the Nairobi and Kisumu route last week. Kenya Airways, Safarilink, Fly 540, Jambojet and Skyward Express dominate the domestic passenger service business. 748 adds pressure to existing airlines on the key routes of Kisumu, Eldoret, Mombasa, Diani, Nairobi, Malindi, and Lamu. Airlines have in recent years competed for the growing middle-class with offers of cheap flights to destinations across the country, with tickets ranging between Sh4,600 to Sh11,000 on key destinations. An online ticket inquiry by the Star yesterday showed Kenya Airways was charges Sh11, 175 for a round trip on the Nairobi-Kisumu route, while Fly 748 charges Sh10,700 for a return ticket. Jambojet had tickets of as low as Sh4,600 with Safarilink tickets going for Sh5,999. Jambojet and Safarilink have dominated the key Mombasa, Diani, Kisumu and Eldoret routes. Skyward Express has equally cemented its position on the Nairobi-Malindi-Lamu-Mombasa and Diani routes, though serving with older aircrafts. Fly 748 plans to use a fleet of about 14 aircrafts, among them Dash 8-Q400 aircrafts, as it seeks a share of the domestic market. It plans to launch two more domestic routes in June to capitalise on mid-year peak season. It will launch Mombasa and Diani routes next month, managing director Moses Mwangi told the Star yesterday. “We plan to start with one flight per day on the Diani route. Mombasa and other destinations will have two daily flights,” said Mwangi.
