The State will put up a modular foot bridge to help Homa Bay and Migori residents cross river Kuja. This comes after hundreds of residents and traders from the two counties who have been using Oria-Riat route were disconnected after the bridge collapsed. The bridge which connects them between Ndhiwa in Homa Bay and Uriri in Migori collapsed early this month. The situation has forced them to rely on boats which are risky and inefficient. But on Thursday, Homa Bay Woman Rep Gladys Wanga said they have agreed with the Ministry of Transport and infrastructure to introduce the modular bridge for temporary use. Speaking when she visited the family of Homa Bay county Covid-19 Emergency Fund Committee vice-chairman Joshua Orero who lost their mother Turfosa Orero in North Kabuoch, Wanga said the bridge will be established this weekend. She said the bridge will be taken to the site and installed by the Kenya Rural Roads Authority. “The ministry of Transport through KeRRA is bringing a modular bridge to the site this weekend to enable people cross as the government plans to construct a modern bridge,” said the MP. Wanga said the modular bridge which is portable, will cushion residents before the modern one is put up. Tender for construction of the permanent bridge has been advertised for bidding. Wanga who is the chairperson of the National Assembly Finance Committee, said the permanent bridge will cost Sh180 million. “We’re hopeful the modern and permanent bridge will soon come to place after the government advertised tender for construction. The modular bridge is a temporary measure,” she said. The Woman Rep said government has earmarked the Marindi-Magina-Otochogo- Riat-Amoyo–Konyango Rabuor road for tarmacking in the next financial year. “Finance committee is trying to ensure money for tarmacking the road is factored in the next financial year budget,” she said. -Edited by SKanyara
