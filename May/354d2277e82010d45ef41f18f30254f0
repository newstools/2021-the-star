Parliament majority leader Amos Kimunya has asked all winners of recently conducted by-elections to dive into work immediately. Kimunya said the new leaders should start making reality all the promises they made to Kenyans without delay. "You don't have much time, just 12 to 14 months. Get on to the job with speed and start delivering the promises you made to the people," he said. He spoke on Wednesday in a video seen by the Star. The Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission conducted three by-elections this week in Bonchari, Juja parliamentary and Rurii ward. George Koimburi of PEP emerged as the MP-elect for Juja constituency, ODM candidate Pavel Oimeke was elected in Kisii's Bonchari while UDA's Francis Muraya scored in Rurii. Kimunya has also addressed his comment  vowing to resign if the Jubilee Party lost in the Rurii ward by-election. A video emerged a day after the election showing the Kipipiri Member of Parliament threatening to resign should should the Nyandarua constituents fail to elect a member of his party. "I wouldn't want to hear, as the majority leader of Jubilee, that the party has failed to win a seat in Nyandarua, I would resign," Kimunya said. Responding to the video, Kimunya said, "These are political issues that you do."
