As the 2022 politics begin to take shape, Kakamega Deputy Governor Prof Philip Kutima has thrown his hat into the ring for the governor post battle. Kutima says he is experienced enough and fit to take over from his boss Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Speaking during the funeral service of Mama Beatrice Opakwa at Emulalwa village in Khwisero over the weekend, the deputy governor said if elected, he stands a high chance of building on Oparanya's flagship and legacy projects, to propel the county to greater heights. He asked leaders and residents to support his bid saying he was the only one who understands the projects and best ways to move the county to the next level having worked closely with Oparanya for the last eight years. "For the period I have served as deputy governor, I have worked closely with Oparanya and I have learnt a lot from him. "I know there are many people eyeing this position but I can assure you none of them can compare to me, owing to our development track record with the incumbent governor. Therefore I urge you to support me to continue with his development plans," he said. Kutima asked area MP Christopher Aseka and other leaders in the county to support him clinch the seat. He said he was ready to work with all leaders regardless of their political affiliations. "I am in ODM but I am ready to work with everybody irrespective of parties," he said. Deputy Speaker Leonard Kasaya who also attended the funeral urged residents to support Kutima for the county's top seat saying governorship requires a manager and experienced person like him. "In Malava we have agreed to fully support Kutima. I urge you my brothers and sisters from Khwisero to join us in this journey to ensure Kutima wins this seat in 2022," saidÂ  Kasaya Others who have shown interest in the position include FCPA Fernandes Barasa, former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale, Lugari MP Ayub Savula, Shinyalu MP Kizito Mugali among others. -Edited by SKanyara
