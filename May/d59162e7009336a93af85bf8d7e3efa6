Nairobi City Stars head coach Sanjin Alagic says his team has a great future despite falling 1-0 in their last outing against multiple Kenya Premier League champions Gor Mahia. Speaking ahead of their encounter against Sofapaka on Monday, Alagic said: “City Stars have played really good football this season and we deserve to have more points. But the fact is that this team is still growing up through Premier league matches. We have what it takes to be a great team in the near future.” The team has picked 17 points from as many games and currently sit 12th in the 17-team standings. He hailed the team’s gradual stride into the premier league years after sitting out the top league. He, however, expressed his concern at how City Stars conceded goals in their games against Gor Mahia and current log leaders Tusker. “It’s disturbing when you see the way how unlucky we conceded goals against Gor and Tusker,” the Uefa pro license holder said in an interview with the club website. Referring to their last match against Gor Mahia, the coach said: “I need to congratulate my players for a great performance. We definitely deserved more because we were the better team in that match.” He added: “Even with a player less, City Stars attacked and put pressure on Gor. we also had an amazing chance at the last minute when Kipkirui and Rodgers (Okumu) were alone in front of goal.” Against Tusker, City Stars drew 2-2 prior to facing Gor Mahia after trailing 2-0 at half-time. With the first leg of the league over, Alagic can now prepare the team for the second leg, which starts on Monday with a game against Sofapaka at Ruaraka. Sofapaka coincidentally lost their last encounter after succumbing to 2-1 to  Wundanyi Stadium in Taita Taveta.
