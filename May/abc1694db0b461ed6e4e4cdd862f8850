The Kenya Basketball Federation is planning a gradual resumption of Premier League action this weekend, KBF competitions secretary Joseph Amoko has said. Amoko said the fixtures will be released in the course of the week but does not expect to have too many matches on the reopening weekend. “I am planning to arrange for a few matches since we are running late. In addition, teams have not trained and need time to prepare adequately,” Amoko said. “I also need to sort issues including the venue in the hope that we will resume normal schedules next weekend.” Ambrose Kisoi, the KBF secretary, added: “All teams will be required to  undertake Covid tests not more than 72 hours before game and present the result an hour before game.” Besides, a list of team delegates for each matchday must be presented in advance for admission at the gate. No fans will be allowed to the match venues. With four continental assignments lined up for clubs and country in the coming months, it will be a race against time for the club and national teams to be at par with their opponents from region. Women champions Equity Bank and runners up Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) are involved in the FIBA Africa Club Championships. The national women and men teams are also scheduled to play at the FIBA Africa AfroBasket qualifiers and finals in July and August respectively.
