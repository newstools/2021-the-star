Vihiga Bullets head coach Edward Manoah has cautioned his charges against conceding goals early in the match given they might experience difficulties staging a successful comeback. Manoah spoke after their impressive five-match unbeaten run was brought to an abrupt end by hard-fighting tail-enders, Mt. Kenya United, in an abrasive National Super League encounter at Camp Toyoyo, Nairobi on Saturday. “The early goals our opponents scored threw us off the balance completely. Although we came back more focused in the second half, our opponents were more determined to defend their lead and thwarted all our attempts to score, and so we congratulate to them. “Going down is definitely very much part of football and all I can do at this juncture is to urge my players on. We have experienced an impressive five-match unbeaten spell prior to today's encounter but we will go back to the drawing board ahead of our next fixture,” he said. Two quick goals within the half-hour mark were all Mt. Kenya needed to carry the day and redeem themselves from a heartbreaking losing streak. Kevin Ndungu put the hosts ahead in the 21st minute before Eric Mmata doubled their advantage in the 33rd minute. Airo Godfrey drew a consolation for the visitors in the 35th minute. James Obat’s goal in the 55th minute was all Kibera Black Stars needed to collect maximum points against Kisumu All-Stars at Ligi Ndogo, Nairobi and ascend to fourth in the NSL standings with 29 points. The loss leaves All-Stars rooted in sixth position with 25 points. Coast Stima came back from behind to see off Migori Youth 2-1 at Mbaraki Stadium. Earnest Oyugi put the visitors ahead in the 30th minute but the advantage was nullified by two successive goals in the 38th and 42nd minutes by Kassim Mohammed and Clinton Ochieng respectively. In Bomet, Silibwet Lions hogged a walkover after Modern Coast Rangers failed to show up for their tie at the IAAF Stadium.
