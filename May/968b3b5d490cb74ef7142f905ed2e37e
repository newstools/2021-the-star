The debate on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) bill, 2020 resumed in the senate on Tuesday morning ahead of the vote. The lawmakers are expected to take a vote on the bill after three weeks of debate characterised by calls to amend the document. But before the vote, speaker Kenneth Lusaka is expected to issue a ruling on whether the House can amend the Bill to expunge 'unconstitutional and undesirable' as pushed by some members.According to schedule of business, the lawmakers will vote on the bill in both second and third reading stages on Tuesday. Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo threw her weight behind the Bill but urged for thorough scrutiny of the allocation of the proposed 70 constituencies. 'There were some constituencies that wee left out as far as allocation of constituencies is concerned. For example, Isiolo North should actually get an extra constituency," she said. The senate deputy majority leader however said that the BBI has protected some constituencies that would have been scrapped due to low population. Proponents of the Building Bridges Initiative will on Thursday know whether the proposed constitutional amendments can go to the referendum. Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jarius Ngaah, Janet Mulwa andÂ  Chacha Mwita are set to make their judgement on seven petitions challenging the BBI process. The petitioners in the case include economist David Ndii, Kenya National Union of Nurses, Thirdway Alliance, 254Hope, Justus Juma, Moraa Omoke, Isaac Aluochier and Muhuri. In February, BBI suffered a major blow after the High Court barred IEBC from preparing for a referendum on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. In a ruling delivered by a five-judge bench, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission was temporarily stopped from preparing for a referendum pending hearing and determination of seven petitions filed challenging the process.
