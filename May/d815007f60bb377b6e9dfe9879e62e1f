Lands Cabinet Secretary, Farida Karoney, has assured Kenyans that the National Land Information Management System cannot be interfered with. Speaking on Wednesday, the CS while responding to questions from Kenyans said measures have been put in place by experts to ensure Ardhi Sasa is safe and secure. "Our multi-agency team of cyber security experts has put in place all the requisite protocols to ensure Ardhisasa is tamper-proof," Karoney said. In the Twitter session under the tag #AskCSKaroney, the Lands CS noted that what is currently going on in the digitised system is conversion, and that some processes are not accessible through Ardhi Sasa, promising to have them gazetted, once complete. Karoney added that the process will soon move to counties bordering Nairobi. "Having launched Ardhisasa in Nairobi, the next stop in the Metropolitan Counties of Kajiado, Murang'a, Kiambu, and Machakos," she said. The National Land Information Management System, known as Ardhi Sasa, was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta on April 27. "The system will resolve the land problem as it will provide an updated, verified database of land records that are easily available," Uhuru said. Under the new system, Kenyans can search for land transactions, transfers and registrations online. Adhi Sasa will also eliminate fraud, corruption and manipulation of critical land records. Ardhi Sasa was developed locally by a team of young Kenyan techies over a three-year period in a multi-agency government arrangement championed by the president.
