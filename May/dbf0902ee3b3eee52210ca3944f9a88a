Safaricom has today unveiled a new data campaign that will see customers enjoy free data every day customised to their usage profiles. As part of the campaign, customers can redeem free daily internet offers tailored to their use by dialling *544# every day for the next 90 days. "The campaign seeks to empower more customers to take their offline passions online as part of the country’s digital transformation agenda," CEO Peter Ndegwa said in a statement on Wednesday. According to data from the Communications Authority, the country has 25 million mobile broadband connections meaning about 60 per cent of mobile phone users barely use the internet. “The 90-day free data campaign seeks to ensure that no customer is left behind by ensuring that all our customers can now access the internet, even at no cost,”  Ndegwa said. The growing demand for data has seen Safaricom roll out campaigns such as ‘Browse Bila Waas’ that rewarded subscribers with free 500MB daily bonus data with every purchase of a personalised no-expiry data bundle.
