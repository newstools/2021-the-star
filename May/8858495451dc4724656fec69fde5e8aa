Education CS George Magoha has blamed parents for the increase in number of candidates sitting for exams while pregnant. "When the hormones are starting to misbehave, by that time you should have told your child how to control her body," Magoha said. Mogoha announced that 652 candidates sat the KCSE exam in hospitals after delivery. This is an increase from 282 in 2019. He however noted that all the candidates got their results. Bungoma had the highest number of female candidates who sat their examination in hospital at 43 students followed by Meru which has 38, Nakuru at 36, and 31 in Nandi County. Mogoha urged parents to refrain from blaming the government for the increase in pregnancies and instead find solutions from the home setting. "Talk to your child. Your child needs your time and wisdom not your money," Mogoha said. Bungoma had the highest prevalence at that time with 45 cases followed by Kakamega at 16 while Meru had 16 cases and 16 in Makueni. According to the CS, the long school closure may have contributed to the high number of pregnancies in schools. The CS has instructed University Education PS Simon Nabukwesi to identify the contributors of the high number of pregnancies. Meanwhile, Magoha, while announcing the results on Monday at the Mitihani House in Nairobi said 2020 KCSE exam candidates performed better compared to those from the previous year. The CS said that all the 747,161 students who sat the exam will be absorbed in universities, colleges as well as TVET institutions. Magoha said that 893 students scored As in the 2020 exam, compared to 627 recorded in 2019. The CS also said that Turkana county had the highest number of overage candidates. Bungoma had the highest number of underage candidates. Underage candidates are those aged 16 years and below. Those who scored C+ and above were just over 143,000.
