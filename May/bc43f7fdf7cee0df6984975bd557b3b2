ODM leader Raila Odinga has lauded senators after passing the Constitutional Amendment Bill, 2020 on Tuesday. After 51 senators voted in favour of the bill, Raila posted on his Twitter account that the document will now move to the next process, adding, ‘Ball Mbele’. Senators allied to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila voted overwhelmingly for the document as those allied to DP William Ruto voted against it. More than two-thirds - 51 of the 67 senators voted in favour of the bill with only 11 voting No as one member abstained from the vote. A referendum is now nigh should the High Court allow IEBC to facilitate the process. Earlier during the day, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka ruled out the possibility of amending the constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020. Lusaka said the Bill is a product of a popular initiative and thus parliament has no power to tinker with the document. "Parliament cannot replace or usurp public views with its own," Lusaka said. On the typographical errors, he says the two speakers of Parliament shall correct the same before the document is taken to the president en route to a referendum. This comes less than a week since the National Assembly unanimously voted for the bill. Lawmakers on Thursday gave the BBI a clean bill of health with an overwhelming vote in support of the first amendment. MPs for the first time attained the required two-thirds majority to vote on a bill to amend the Constitution.
