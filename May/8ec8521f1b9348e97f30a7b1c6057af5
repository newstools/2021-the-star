Kisumu County Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o has asked Kenyans to ignore the rumours being spread on social media claiming that he is dead. The governor claimed on Saturday through his Twitter account that the people who are behind the rumours are his enemies. “There are disgruntled souls dead set to derail the speedy economic growth in Kisumu who would wish I were dead as early as yesterday,” Nyong’o said. He continued that; “The rumour on Twitter announcing my passing on is the evil genius of desperate opponents. It should be dismissed with the contempt it deserves.” The governor who is serving his first term in office has launched a number of projects that are meant to transform the face of the county. The 308km Olkaria- Lessos -Kisumu transmission project funded at a cost of Sh16 billion is on course, financed by the government of Kenya and Japan International Cooperation Agency. In January, the Kisumu county government and Laptrust signed a memorandum of understating on the Sh3.8 billion affordable housing project. More than 1,200 decent and low-cost units will be built under the Anderson- Ofafa Affordable Housing Project. Nyong’o and Laptrust County Pension Fund CEO Hosea Kili signed the MoU at Mama Grace Hall in Kisumu.
