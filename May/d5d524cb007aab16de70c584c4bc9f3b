Celebrated musicians couple Wahu and Nameless, in partnership with Eugene Mbugua from Documentary and Reality TV, on Friday unveiled the first season of their docu-reality series, 'This Love'. 'This Love' will premiere exclusively on Showmax today. The 13-part series will highlight Nameless and Wahu’s timeless love, colourful lives and legendary history, as well as the lessons they have picked up along the way. Speaking during the event, Nameless and Wahu also shared more about their upcoming joint album, also titled 'This Love', which they said inspired the docu-reality series. “As we strive to do this joint album, we also want to share the story behind the music. We want to give insights on what inspires us, what drives us, our thought process, personalities, our shared and different perspectives and our different temperaments,” the couple said. 'This Love' creator Mbugua teased what viewers can expect from the series. He said the series will delve into what’s happening in Nameless and Wahu’s lives in the present, while also taking viewers back to those moments that led them to where they are today. “Their story is also closely intertwined with that of the Kenyan music industry, and so the audience will get a window into some nuggets they did not know about their favourite stars both present and past.” Showmax East and Southern channel director Timothy Okwaro reiterated MultiChoice’s commitment to local content. He praised the couple for being pioneers in the music industry in Kenya and for staying relevant for more than 20 years. “It’s admirable how they (Nameless and Wahu) have managed to reinvent themselves and stay relevant even with the changing genres of the music industry in Kenya. We are happy to see them open up their lives to us for the first time, and most importantly, to have that happen on our platform,” Okwaro said. New episodes will be released weekly on Showmax.
