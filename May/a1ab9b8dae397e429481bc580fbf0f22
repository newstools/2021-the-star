A Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania has been diverted to Minsk, with Belarusian opposition figures saying it was done so a dissident journalist on board could be arrested. The opposition Nexta channel on Telegram said its ex-editor Roman Protasevich had been detained. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda accused Belarus of an "abhorrent action" and demanded his release. Belarus state media said the plane had been diverted because of a bomb scare. Opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who was beaten by Alexander Lukashenko last year in presidential polls widely denounced as rigged, also demanded Mr Protasevich's release. Since August's election the 66-year-old Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994, has cracked down on dissenting voices. Many opposition figures have been arrested or, like Ms Tikhanovskaya, fled into exile. Latvia's Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said Belarus's action was "contrary to international law" and the reaction should be "strong and effective". Germany demanded an "immediate explanation" from Belarus. In the UK, Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, said that "forcing an aircraft to land to silence opposition voices is an attack on democracy." The diversion of Flight FR4978 from Athens to Vilnius on Sunday was visible on the flightradar124 website. It showed the plane turning east to Minsk shortly before it reached the Lithuania border. Ryanair has not yet responded to a request for comment. Russian media quoted the Minsk airport press service as saying the plane had made an emergency landing following an alleged bomb scare. Belta, the state-owned news agency in Belarus, said Lukashenko had personally given the order for the plane to land at Minsk following the bomb alert, and that a MiG-29 fighter jet had been despatched to accompany the Ryanair plane. Nexta said no bomb was found on board and the passengers were searched, after which Protasevich, 26, was detained.
