Tanzania's President Suluhu Hassan will arrive in Kenya on Tuesday for a two-day state visit. State House spokesperson Kanze Dena-Mararo on Sunday said President Uhuru Kenyatta will receive his Tanzania counterpart at State House, Nairobi. Last month, Kenya sent Sports CS Amina Mohamed to Tanzania for talks on strengthening the relationship between the two countries. Suluhu said that her administration is determined to solve some of the issues existing between Tanzania and Kenya. Last month, Kenya's plans to jointly set up an oil pipeline with Uganda hit a wall after the land locked country teamed up with Tanzania. The deal was signed in the maiden weekend visit of Suluhu to Uganda throwing into jeopardy the 1500 kilometre pipeline project between Kenya, Uganda and South Sudan. During Mohamed's visit to Tanzania, Suluhu directed the Joint Permanent Commission (JPC) between the two countries to meet and come up with plans that can strengthen the relationship. The commission last met in 2016. Uhuru’s message delivered by Mohamed was that Kenya is ready for bilateral talks. It was at the meeting where Uhuru extended an invite to Suluhu to make her first visit to Kenya as the president. Suluhu was sworn-in in February, becoming the first female president in Tanzania.
