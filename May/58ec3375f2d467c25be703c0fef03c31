A 57-year-old pastor at a Kabete Anglican Church in Kiambu county was on Thursday night rescued from an armed gang that had taken him hostage. Police said two suspects were shot dead in the drama that unfolded. A pistol and other weapons were recovered from the suspects. According to the Director of Criminal Investigations, the clergyman identified as John Dinguri Chege, was hijacked at about 8pm by four armed men, as he drove home. After taking control of his vehicle, the gangsters commandeered it towards Kiamumbi area in Kiambu county. When police officers got wind of the incident, they pursued the suspects while a separate team laid an ambush along Kamiti Road, about 20 kilometers away. According to police, in a well executed plan to rescue the man of the cloth from the gang, the vehicle was finally intercepted some metres past Jacaranda estate in the same area which is near Kiamumbi. The suspects were ordered to surrender but they defied the orders, prompting a fierce shootout that left two of the suspected thugs dead. Two other suspects disappeared in the dead of the night with gunshot wounds, leaving the church Minister in the safety of the police officers. According to police, a Smith and Wesson pistol loaded with two rounds of 9mm calibre and a knife, were recovered from suspects. The hunt for the other two is ongoing. Police said they are investigating to establish why the pastor was targeted. “There must be something they were after. We want to establish the motive,” said an officer aware of the probe. Incidents of kidnapping have been on the decline after police dismantled some of the gangs behind the trend.
