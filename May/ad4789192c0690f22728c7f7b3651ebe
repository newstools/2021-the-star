Eight-year-old Michelle Jennifer Ouma stepped forward to answer a maths question at New View Academy in Kayole. She was just explaining when she collapsed, fell onto the floor and died. Teachers told the police the Grade 2 pupil collapsed as she answered a question. Reports of the death on Wednesday last week  came to light recently. Instead rushing her to a hospital, teachers kept Jennifer in a separate room hoping she would regain consciousness. An hour later she was still unresponsive. She was taken to Mama Lucy Hospital by three men who are said to have left the body there after realising she was still unresponsive. Jennifer was pronounced dead on arrival. Police are investigating if any crime was committed in handling the matter. A postmortem will be performed. Her mother Linda Achieng said she was called by police and informed her child was not well and she should rush to the hospital. “At the hospital I found about six doctors who questioned me on how my daughter was dressed and after I answered they opened the curtain where I saw her body lying motionless,” Achieng said. She was informed her daughter collapsed and died in class but it took longer to take her to hospital. Achieng said she had taken Jennifer to school in the morning and she was supposed to come back home with other neighbours. Police said they were informed the girl's body had been taken to the hospital by three unidentified men. Nairobi police boss Augustine Nthumbi said they have talked to at least 10 people who handled the case. Police visited the hospital and questioned staff present when the body was delivered. They reviewed CCTV footage of the three men who dropped off the body and left. Some residents staged a peaceful protest on Friday last week but police dispersed them. Nyumba Kumi chairman Joseph Shihemi said protesters were angry over lack of communication from the school. (Edited by V. Graham)
