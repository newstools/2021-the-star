"Right now I'm just enjoying getting to know him and being parents." When asked about proposing to Corazon, Frankie said, "This one is mine. Trust me." Corazon further added that Frankie is the best father of her child. "I made the best choice having him as the father of my baby because he has helped me from day one. I was so clueless but he had some experience, so he was really helpful. He is a great dad," she said. Corazon and Frankie are raising a son together. Speaking about post-partum depression, Corazon said she realised she will never be perfect as a mum and has accepted that as a first mum, she will tend to make mistakes. "I will never have everything figured out. It was my first time having a baby and it put a lot of pressure on me. But once I accepted that sometimes I will make mistakes, and that it might not be exciting like I thought it would be, it slipped away. I talked to my mum and Frankie’s mum." She described motherhood as an amazing journey. "It was hard at first but right now I really want to rush home to my baby. It is the most amazing thing, the best thing that happened to me and I want more," she said.
