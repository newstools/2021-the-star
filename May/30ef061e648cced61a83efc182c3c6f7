Police in Kisumu are searching for more than 30 youths for allegedly setting fire on two houses in a retaliatory attack on Thursday morning. The youths stormed Otera village within Nyalunya sub-location in Kisumu East subcounty to allegedly avenge the death of a man who was attacked in the area and died from his injuries. The youth was allegedly attacked while escorting a girl from their home turf. A house belonging to John Juma was reduced to ashes with all the household items. Among the properties was Sh140,000 in cash, clothes, four TV sets, one sofa set and other assorted items all estimated at Sh650,000. George Onyango also lost his property after his house was burnt. The value of damaged property had yet to be established. He was stabbed on the head and stomach with a sharp object. Kisumu county police boss Samuel Anampiu said that the arson attack was reported by Nyalunya assistant chief Bonface Modho. He said the group from Ofunyu village meted violence against some residents of Otera village and their properties. Anampiu said police officers were deployed to Otera village and quelled the violence. "We established that two houses were set ablaze during the morning incident. Injuries were also reported," the police said. Anampiu said Onyango is admitted to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital. The irate youths also smashed windows of neighbouring houses with stones as they escaped from the scene. One suspect, Brian Okoth, was arrested and identified as a member of the group. Anampiu said police were forced to fire in the air to disperse the irate youths. "The suspect will be arraigned on Friday," the county police boss said. Anampiu warned residents against taking the law into their hands and urged them to resolve conflicts through dialogue. Juma appealed for help to recover lost items.  (edited by o. owino)
