TSC CEO Nancy Macharia has announced that 37 teachers have died of Covid-19 complications. Macharia said the 37 include 24 principals, three deputy principals and 10 classroom teachers. "We don't want to continue losing our teachers. Kindly take the Covid-19 vaccine in centres," Macharia said. As of Sunday, TSC had 151,494 teachers vaccinated, constituting 48.9% females and 51.1% males. Macharia was speaking during the release of 2020 KCSE results at Mitihani House on Monday. She further said some teachers were involved in unethical behaviour. "They would screenshot the exams before disseminatingÂ them to candidates. We are very disappointed by this report," she said. A school principal went ahead and put the examination on his Whatsapp profile. "A senior teacher took screenshots and it was recovered as the cellphone was being taken to a candidate in hospital," she said. Macharia advised teachers against abetting exam cheating, saying TSC doesn't support any form of malpractices. Last month, 11 examination officials were arrested over attempts to expose KCSE examination papers. Education CS George Magoha said the officials who include centre managers and supervisors were from Homa Bay, Mandera, Kisii, Garissa and Kisumu. In Homa Bay county, they arrested two centre managers and a supervisor. Announcement of the results will pave the way for admission to universities, colleges and technical institutions. Knec data shows that 752,933 candidates registered to sit last year's KCSE exam in 10,437 centres. But only 747, 161 candidates sat the exam across 10, 567 examination centres. 31 subjects were examined in 77 papers. Last week, the marking of the exam ended with some examiners staging protests over their dues.
