Daniel Simiyu, alias Dantez 254, has released a single called 'Kombola.' This comes just weeks after the 16-year-old made waves with 'Alaa'. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, the Form 3 student at Bwake Boys' High School said the reception of the song also surprised him. "I was so excited. I featured Rekless, Odi wa Murang'a and VDJ Jones, and we made such a masterpiece." He said 'Kombola is "about praising a woman and appreciating her, her beauty and her shape". The Maliza Umaskini signee started as a gospel artiste. "I got into the secular side for money purposes," he said. Dantez, who is raised by a single parent, said his mother was reluctant at first when he got into the music industry but now supports his career.
