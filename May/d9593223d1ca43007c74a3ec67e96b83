Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai on Wednesday inspected the construction of the National Police Leadership Academy in Ngong, Kajiado. President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the construction of a leadership police academy and 210 housing units in Ngong earlier this year. The project which is funded by the Central Bank of Kenya at Sh1 billion is set to be completed by end of 2021. Upon completion, the academy will provide the National Police Service with modern facilities for the training of its senior leadership. Uhuru performed the ground-breaking Ceremony for Kenya Police Leadership Academy. These include; adequate accommodation for 220, classrooms and lecture rooms, a well-equipped auditorium with seating for 450, kitchen and dining facilities, and recreational facilities. In a statement, CBK said it is supporting the development of this project through a memorandum of understanding with NPS. Mutyambai also went to Karen Police Station in Nairobi where he inspected the progress of the ongoing Karen police canteen.
