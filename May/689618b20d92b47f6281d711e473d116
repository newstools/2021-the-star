 Celebrations rocked little-known Moi Naikarra Secondary School in Narok soon after Education CS George Magoha announced the 2020 KCSE exam results. Only six out of its 246 candidates will miss out on a direct university entry, making the school top in Narok county. Located near the famous Maasai Mara Game Reserve in Narok West subcounty, the school posted a mean score of 8.7. It had a 6.9 mean score in 2019 exams. This is the sixth consecutive year the school has improved on its performance. Principal John Kuyo led the students and teachers to the streets of Narok town to celebrate their tremendous achievements. Kuyo said the cooperation among all stakeholders and hard work from the students was the reason for their success. “The challenges of early marriages, teenage pregnancies, culture and Covid-19 did not deter us from achieving our dreams. Even when the schools were closed last year and most institutions resorted to online learning, we were not able to do so due to poor network which is being experienced in this area,” Kuyo said. He said that the school is known for transforming students who got below average marks in the KCPE exam to stellar performers. Kuyo said that he took over the management of the school 10 years ago when the institution was usually last in the county. He put in place structures that have improved performance. Meanwhile, former giant Narok Boys High School recorded improved performance, posting a mean grade of 6.0933 from 5.7785 in 2019. This is attributed to the changes in the management introduced three years ago by the Education ministry. School principal David Kirui swapped places with Isaac Seret, who moved to Koiwa High School. Before joining Koiwa High School, the experienced school head was in charge of Longisa High School in Bomet and dominated the region during his reign. Kirui, who is also vice chairman of the Narok County Heads Association, said that they are targeting a mean grade above seven.  (edited by o. owino)
