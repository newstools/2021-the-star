Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua has said the Building Bridges Initiative, is a poisoned glass of milk, and Kenyans have no business taking it. Speaking to KTN News on Wednesday night, Karua insisted that the entire BBI process was wrong. "What happened was exactly what used to happen under KANU where the state would use state machinery, the provincial administration. The signatures were coerced. People were not being given the BBI documents to read," Karua said. She said there was intolerance for those who were opposed to BBI, which was an outright denial of a balanced menu from which Kenyans would make a choice. Karua said she could only remember what was wrong with the constitutional amendment document; among them mixing up roles and delimiting constituencies without involving the people. "Trying to compromise the judiciary through a government inspector known as Ombudsman, returning the imperial president, removing vetting of top state officials by parliament," she said. The former gubernatorial aspirant noted that nothing stops the government from allocating the 35 per cent of the budget to the devolved units, since the constitution only sets the lower limit. Karua mentioned that if the promoters of the BBI  who include the president, were honest, they should have put the 35 percent in the June budget as a show of goodwill. "It is not there because this is just a bait," Karua said. Martha Karua who is part of a lobby group - Linda Katiba Movement, has continued to call out President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga who are promoters of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 Karua said the BBI project has been illegitimate and unconstitutional from the beginning and that the president was using the process to make it possible for him to exercise unlimited power. She maintains that the 2010 Constitution is transformative.
