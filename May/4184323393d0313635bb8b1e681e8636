Simbas head coach Paul Odera is keen to in-calculate core values into the national team as they seek to qualify for a first Rugby World Cup in two years time. The former Kenya U-20 coach wants the players to show respect, honesty, perseverance and leadership in a bid to assist the Simbas in their quest to reach France 2023. “Making the World Cup in France is something much bigger than just rugby for us,” Odera  said. “Our qualification will not only bring this country together but will also unite different races, tribes, ethnic and social groups together,” he noted. He added: “What's driving me is my passion and this is what I'm trying to get into my players, coaching staff and Kenya Rugby Union. The long and short of it is that we must transform this country through rugby because this is the only way we can earn success on and off the field," he added. The former international last month named a bumper 102 players for the opening qualifiers against Zambia and Senegal slated for  July. Covid-19  restrictions mean that the players will initially meet virtually before the squad is trimmed to 50 and then 30. There are also plans to hold a training camp in Stellenbosch, South Africa in June. The Simbas last played in September 2019, beating rivals Zimbabwe 36-15 in Nakuru with the Kenya Cup campaign suspended due to a spike in Covid-19 cases in March. And, although two of the three teams will progress to the next round, Odera is still worried that lack of match practice and conditioning could hurt his side. “Both teams are really are banana skins. This is because a majority of Zambia's team are in the military probably, they have been training. “Senegal at times pick heavily from their Francophone players currently playing in second and third division in France. I don't know if some are in the first division, but they are an unknown quantity and Europe is opening up now. "
