Deputy President William Ruto's firstborn daughter June Ruto is set to wed her Nigerian fiancé Alexander Paul Ezenaga today. The wedding will take place at 11.30 am at Karen 97A, Koitobos Road. An adult reception will follow at the same venue. June's fiance alongside his family members visited Ruto's family early this month for dowry negotiations and introductions. After the dowry ceremony, June posted her thanks on social media. "Finally: He who finds a wife finds a good thing, And obtains favour from the Lord. I thank God for the blessings in this memorable moment. Today has been an important day as I have my better half @AlexEzenagu. Sincere thanks go to God, my dad, mom, sister, friends and all relatives," she wrote. High-profile dignitaries from both Kenya and Nigeria are expected to attend the event.

He currently is an Assistant Law Professor at the Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar. He is known to specialise in international tax law, transfer pricing, tax planning, investment advisory and commercial law advisory and practice. June Ruto studied international relations at the University of Queensland, Australia, and also has a bachelor’s degree in diplomacy from the United States International University in Nairobi.
