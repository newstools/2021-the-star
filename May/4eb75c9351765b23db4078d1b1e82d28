A 26-year-old man on Wednesday night butchered his wife before he took his own life. John Kuria and his wife Diana Wekesa, 20, are said to have had separated a week ago over domestic issues before reuniting on Wednesday evening. The incident occurred at Kolonget village, Soy subcounty. The two are said to have been feuding often. Matunda location Chief Barbnabas Tireito said Kuria ejected his wife from their home and threw out all her belongings the week before, warning her never to come back. Tireito said Wekesa returned on Wednesday and a disagreement ensued. He said the assailant tried to strangle and suffocate his wife using a piece of cloth before he slit her throat using a kitchen knife. “We found her body lying in a pool of blood with a black piece of cloth tied around her neck and kitchen knife thrown beside her,” said the chief. He said after killing his wife, Kuria hanged himself and his body was found hanging from the rafter of the house which had been locked from inside. The two bodies were removed by officers from Moisbrige police station and taken to Kitale mortuary as investigations were launched into the incident.
