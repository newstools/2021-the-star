World Athletics president Lord Coe has told decision-makers to back the return of Parkrun “or risk losing it forever”. The weekly community running events take place in hundreds of parks across the UK, but were suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Organisers say plans to resume in early June “hang in the balance” with under half of its venues granting permission. “We should be proud of how ParkrunUK has helped make the world healthier and happier,” Coe tweeted. “It is now time to ensure it has a future. We must act to save this great health and wellbeing charity.” Culture secretary Oliver Dowden has said ministers will write to local authorities and landowners about allowing Pakrun to restart. “We will shortly be sending a very clear message and signal in writing to local authorities about our expectation that those events should proceed,” Dowden told the Commons on Thursday. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has also backed the return of the initiative. “My City Hall team stand ready to work with London Councils, the Parkrun team and volunteer organisers to help make this a reality,” he said. The Parkrun movement was founded in Bushy Park, London, in 2002 by Paul Sinton-Hewitt and is now active in 22 countries. Runners or walkers can take part in 5km events on Saturday mornings, while 2km junior events take place on Sunday mornings. Events are free and run by volunteers, but also rely on local councils and land owners to let them be staged. There are 729 different locations across the UK holding the weekly events and more than two million runners have taken part. Despite being given permission by the UK government to return on 5 June, and having support from Public Health England and Sport England, organisers say “a combination of obstacles ­— including misunderstanding of the roadmap [out of lockdown], reluctance, hesitation and unnecessary red tape — threatens to delay the return of Parkrun indefinitely”.
