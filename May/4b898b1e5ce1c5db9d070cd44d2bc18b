The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has urged Kenyans to formally report  experiences with fraudsters to the authorities for necessary action to be initiated. DCI said that it is in receipt of numerous complaints from members of the public who report to have fallen victim of a suspected fraud syndicate, operating within Nairobi’s Central Business District. The fraudsters operate from a vehicle (pictured) behind Kenya Archives, along Tom Mboya Street, posing as genuine marketers of unreasonably cheap smart phones, iPads, tablets and other flashy electronic products. "The well organized syndicate consists of young men and women, who pose as sales agents of a renown mobile telecommunication company," DCI said on Tuesday. They also purport to assist clients in upgrading their sim cards to 5G network. "Once they have the full attention of an unsuspecting would be buyer, they access the victim's mobile money transfer pin and other mobile banking details, after which they transfer money from the victims’ accounts to unknown accounts," DCI noted. Whereas detectives and general duty police officers have previously arrested the fraudsters after receiving complaints from victims, DCI pointed out that the victims hardly show up at the police stations or DCI offices to file formal reports, thus weakening the evidential aspect upon arraignment of the suspects. "As such, we appeal to members of the public who may have been hoodwinked by the fraudsters to report at DCI Headquarters’ Serious Crime Unit, to formally report their experiences with the syndicate for necessary Police action to be initiated," DCI said.
