Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) competitions secretary, Joseph Amoko has said this year's national league could spill over to 2022. He said they are waiting for the Ministry of Sports to announce the return to the sports roadmap before releasing the fixtures. "It is not clear as to when the activities will start again but the fixtures are ready and will be released as soon as the announcement is made," Amoko said. He said once action resumes, KBF  will engage stakeholders before coming up with a  decision on the best way forward. "It is not only the league that is of concern to us, there are also international events for both clubs and country." National women's champions Equity Bank and Kenya Ports Authority will be engaged in the FIBA Africa women's Club Championships. The national sides Lionesses (women) and Morans (men) teams will be involved in FIBA Afro-Basket qualifiers and finals in July and August respectively. "These are programs we must put into perspective alongside the premier and the lower division league matches. The league fixtures will continue from where we left when activities were halted. I will only make changes on the dates otherwise everything else remains the same." Amoko said his only prayers are once activities get the green light to resume, they will be able to go on uninterrupted.
