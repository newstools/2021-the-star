Residents of Kamagawi and Genga locations in Rangwe are facing an acute water shortage after unknown people vandalised pipes at the Kokinda project. Kokinda Water Supply project was built more than three decades ago to help end perennial shortages in the two locations. West Gem MCA Charles Awino regretted that the project was vandalised soon after he rehabilitated it. The project, which serves more than 200 families, was constructed by Amref to cushion the residents who had been walking long distances in search of clean water for domestic use and for animals. Awino said it had recently stopped working after the pipes got clogged but he catered to the cost of repairs.Â But at the weekend, vandals brought down a wall at and damaged pipes. He suspects the vandals were hired by his opponents. No arrest has been made in connection with the incident, but a local police boss said they were investigating.
