Jubilee party has opted for interviews rather than conducting nominations for aspirants of the Muguga ward and kiambaa constituency by-election. All aspirants for the seats have been asked to present themselves at the party headquarters on Saturday for the interview. Jubilee party secretary General said in a statement on Thursday that successful  candidates shall be presented with nomination certificate in accodarnce with the party Nomination Rules2010. "We regret any inconvenience caused by the change of mode of nominations," Tuju said. This seems to be a change of tactic for Jubilee party which has suffered major setback in its perceived strongholds after losing in the Juja, Rurii and Bonchari by-elections. The by-elections for Kiambaa Member of National Assembly and Muguga Ward MCA have been slated for July 15. Muguga's by-election comes following the demise of Eliud Ngugi, who passed on in March at the Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital. Kiambaa Constituency lost its MP Paul Koinange to Covid-19 related complications on March 31. Political parties have until May 17 to submit a list of persons nominated to contest in the two by-elections to the IEBC. Parties have the same period to present candidates intending to vie through direct nominations.
