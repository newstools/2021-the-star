Murang’a Seal coach David Mahira is hopeful his struggling side can claw their way out of the relegation mire with the National Super League season poised to return following the government’s decision to allow all sporting activities in the country resume. With nearly half of the campaign done and dusted, Seal find themselves second from bottom with sixteen points from as many games. “We were obviously disappointed that football was been suspended. This, however, was a blessing in disguise for us because we needed time to regroup and work out things. We would have loved to try and extricate ourselves from our current situation but the health of our players, fans and other Kenyans take precedent over anything else,” Mahira said. Seal have endured tough times since they clinched a historic place in the second tier league. Most of their key players have left to seek greener pastures elsewhere with the club now relying mostly on local talent from Murang’a County. “We have limited resources to keep top talent in the team. We have to find other ways to cope while remaining competitive and using local talent was our only option,” Mahira explained. Talanta lead the NSL standings with 32 points same as fast improving Police FC.
