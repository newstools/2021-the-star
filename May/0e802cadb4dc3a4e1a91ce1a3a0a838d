Illegal fishermen in Lake Naivasha have asked the county government for an alternative source of livelihood. The fishermen said they were driven to illegal fishing by unemployment and poverty, which have been worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. Their plea comes barely two weeks after security officers from the Kenya Coast Guards Services started patrolling the water body. In the last year, the number of youths involved in illegal fishing in the lake has risen to more than 500 raising fears that the fisheries sector could collapse. Speaking during a forum on Tarembete beach in Kasarani, the youths said the only solution to the problem is fish ponds. Samuel Oloo, one of the youths, said it has become difficult to get a job in the tens of flower farms in the area. “The decision to force the youths out of the lake is merely transferring the problem to the estates and streets as these people have to survive,” he warned on Friday. Simon Baraza said they were keen to work in ponds if backed by the county government. “Currently the lake is one of the most dangerous places to venture into due to the patrols and attacks by hippos but we don’t have any option as we also have families to feed,” he said. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mutua Kisilu said they will ensure law and order in the lake. “For a long time we have pushed to have coast guards seconded to the lake to address the issue of illegal fishing and we are glad that they are finally here,” he said. He admitted that the fisheries office was overstretched by the current crisis and termed the arrival of the guards timely. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
