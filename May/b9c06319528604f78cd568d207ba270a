President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to visit DP William Ruto at his Karen home over the wedding ceremony of his daughter June. Speaking when he was about to leave the parliament buildings on Thursday for the prayer breakfast, Uhuru said he will make the visit after Madaraka day. “Pongezi tena saana… you will tell them…nitawaona nikitoka Kisumu,” Uhuru told Ruto. Loosely translates to: (Congratulations again..tell them that I will see them once i'm back from Kisumu) It was a joyful day for Ruto and his family as he officially handed over the hand of his daughter - June - to her Nigerian husband Alexander Ezenagu. The invite only wedding ceremony was held at Ruto's private residence in Karen, which saw only close friends and family witness the two exchange their vows, with an adult reception following later at the same venue. June's wedding was filled with pomp and colour as guests graced the event in their top notch outfits. Uhuru was among the invited guests but he did not make it. Instead, the president went to Karen to award a Charter for the National Defence University. After that he is expected in Kisumu for a five-day tour of Nyanza on a blitz packed with projects to reignite handshake hopes among ODM boss Raila Odinga's supporters. The President is heading to Kisumu to lead the country in the June 1 Madaraka Day celebrations, but his visit is laden with political symbolism at a time when the handshake commitment appears shaky. While in Kisumu, the President will walk a tightrope and strike a delicate balance to renew hope the BBI reggae will resume, without attacking the Judiciary. The President will also inspect and launch a couple of government development projects in the county.
