Cyd Wambui is the new Kiss FM co-host for the drive show with Chito Ndhlovu. Speaking to Word Is, Cyd said this is her first job in the media and she counts it as a dream come true. "I signed my contracts on my 25th birthday. I was wondering what have I achieved so far, so getting the job I count as a dream come true," she said. Cyd said a few months ago, she was frustrated for not securing a media job two years since she graduated. "I used to listen to Caroline Mutoko at a very young age. I would imitate her voice and all. People who know me know how I am passionate about radio," she said. "Kiss FM is a big brand and I never expected I would ever work with them coz I always thought these big radio stations hire personalities with big names." She said she applied for the job over six months ago and forgot about it. "I was like, if this never happens, I will look for another job coz media is not for me. I promise to give them the best coz this is a passion. A girl who is on a journey. I want people to see me grow." Cyd says she is not tapping into the negativity that comes with the pressure but she is going with the moments. "My dad is happy that I can pay my rent. I am the firstborn of seven. My dad thought it was a waste of money. It's kinda a good pace for my siblings," she said. "My mum has also studied journalism and so she was so proud that I got the job." Asked what her fans should expect from her, Cyd said she wants to be a medium platform for creatives in Kenya. "Chito is very patient with me and willing to listen to my ideas. I watch him do his thing and so I am learning. I would use my phone to do my recording since my mantra is to use what you got to get where you want to get." Cyd is also passionate about being black. "I hate it when makeup artists try to make you look lighter when you have a darker skin tone because makeup should bring out beauty rather than changing what you look like."
