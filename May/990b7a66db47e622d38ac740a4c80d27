Culture is dynamic and should evolve and change with the times. That is why some practices, norms, beliefs, values, ideas and ideals that had meaning a century ago might not hold today. It is therefore saddening that at a time when Kenya is doing all that is possible to end female genital mutilation, some individuals are still secretly promoting the vice. At the weekend, Public Service and Gender administrative secretary Jebii Kilimo was in Kericho, where she decried the return of FGM among the Kipsigis. (See Page 10) She said some men are boycotting food prepared by their uncircumcised wives while uncircumcised mothers are sometimes circumcised by professional nurses during deliveries at local hospitals to retain their marriage status. She rightfully said the Kalenjin community should carefully choose and maintain cultural values that benefit them and do away with retrogressive ones. In 2011 Kenya passed a law prohibiting FGM and imposed tough penalties on perpetrators and those abetting the practice. Medical research has proven that FGM can affect a woman's mental health, lead to death through severe bleeding, urination problems, infection, menstrual difficulties and infertility. Jebii has been at the forefront against FGM and her efforts need all-around support to wipe out cultural practices that have been overtaken with time. Leaders, the provincial administration and the church must come out strongly to educate the public on the dangers of FGM.
