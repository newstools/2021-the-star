The National Hospital Insurance Fund is taking biometric data of Taita Taveta residents to help serve them better. The drive funded by the national government and Amref Innovation Africa is targeting 13,500 households. Deputy Governor Majala Mlagui said the health department has identified needy and vulnerable persons for enrolment to the NHIF cover under the Universal Health Coverage initiative. She said the registration will further weed out fraudsters in the health sector and hasten service delivery. Mlagui spoke during the launch of the drive at Bura health centre. “This move will also curb abuse at all service delivery levels. There will be easy identification of beneficiaries,” Mlagui said. After the one-week grassroots registration, others targeted will be captured at service points, Huduma centres and all contracted healthcare facilities in the county. The county government further targets to roll out campaigns to register all the residents on the NHIF medical cover. Mlagui said the registration is aimed at streamlining health services to the citizens. Universal Healthcare Task Force chairman Washington Okoth advised residents to register at government hospitals as the institutions would benefit from expansions cash. “The government is investing a lot in the expansion of health facilities across the country as part of the Big 4 Agenda,” Okoth said. “We, therefore, encourage Kenyans to consider public hospitals in this registration.” He said the facilities to benefit from the expansion will also be spread at the grassroots level. Health services executive John Mwakima said the department had incorporated the community health volunteers in the socio-economic mapping of households in UHC across the county. “CHVs are playing an important role in this exercise. They are our focal point in identifying and mobilising all deserving residents to be enrolled in UHC,” he said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
