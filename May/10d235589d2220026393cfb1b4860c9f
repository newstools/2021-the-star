The Education ministry has postponed the Form One selection exercise that was set to take place on May 28 and pushed it to June 15. Speaking in Nairobi on Monday, Education CS George Magoha did not give a reason for the postponement, but said there is no cause for alarm. He spoke at Joseph Kangethe Primary School. Magoha said the process will be free and fair. Placement of 2020 KCSE candidates to technical colleges will, however, begin on Monday. Those who qualified for university placement under government sponsorship have also been instructed to review their degree choices. They will be placed in universities in July. A total of 160,000 places have been identified in public and private universities. A lockdown, eight-month school closure and a half-hearted attempt at online learning did not stop the 2020 KCPE exam candidates from posting good grades. Candidates, parents, and education managers had worried the performance would be poor because of the Covid-19 disruptions. Stakeholders called for the examiners to factor in the unique circumstances, but the candidates weathered the storm and are all expected to transition to secondary school. It is the government policy to ensure 100 per cent transition. Last month, Magoha promised every candidate will get a place in secondary school as he announced the results on Thursday at the Kenya National Examination Council headquarters. “We are determined to work with the relevant agencies to ensure that no candidate misses a place in secondary school," Magoha said. Of the more than one million candidates, 8,091 scored more than 400 marks. Another 243,320 got between 301 and 400 marks. Some 586,886 candidate scored between 201 and 300 marks while 262,307 candidates had between 101 and 200 marks. Only 1,173 pupils had 100 marks and below. The results came exactly 23 days after completion of the examination and four months late after delayed commencement. The exam is usually administered in November and results released in December.
