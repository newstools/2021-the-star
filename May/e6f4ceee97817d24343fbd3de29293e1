The Jubilee party has unveiled candidates for the July 15, Kiambaa and Muguga ward by elections. In an announcement on Tuesday, the party Secretary General Raphael Tuju said Karanja Kariri Njama and Mung'ara Joseph Githinji were the successful candidates from the party nomination. "We present to you Mr. Karanja Kariri Njama and Mr. Mung'ara Joseph Githinji, who have been nominated to represent the Party in the upcoming by-elections in Kiambaa Constituency and Muguga Ward," Tuju said. According to the ruling party, Njama scored 78 per cent in the interviews conducted by the party in search of a suitable candidate to represent the party in the Kiambaa by-election, trouncing Munyui and Damaris who scored 61 and 59 per cent respectively. This comes a few days after Jubilee announced that it had opted for interviews rather than conducting nominations for aspirants of the Muguga ward and Kiambaa constituency by-elections. All aspirants for the seats were asked to present themselves at the party headquarters on Saturday last week, for the interviews. "We regret any inconvenience caused by the change of mode of nominations," Tuju said. Deputy President William Ruto led, UDA unveiled its candidates for the Muguga ward and Kiambaa constituency by-election on Friday last week. John Njuguna Wanjiku and Kamau Thumbi received their nomination certificates for Kiambaa and Muguga at the party headquarters, in an event presided over by Secretary-General Veronica Maina.
