World Rally Championship Safari Rally debut always elicits unique excitement and anticipation. This year will not be different when the motor rallying event returns to the global circuit after a long hiatus. Following confirmation of 52 entries on Friday, women entrants are already hankering for a taste of the rare WRC experience. Navigator Chantal Louis Young couldn't hide her incessant longing for WRC Safari. Chantal, who has previously co-driven Natasha Tundo and Samira Khan, will see her dream come to fruition when she calls the pace-notes for debutant Maxime Wahome. Chantal: "To see my name on an FIA WRC entry list is something I could never have had imagined! And to be participating in my home country is even better! Flying the ‘Young’ name high and hope to it proud! Granny and Grandad, Young this one is for you! "Linet Ayuko sounded equally enthusiastic about her partnership with Hussein Malik and said: "Dreams/goals do come true. From growing up watching the WRC Safari Rally to now being shortlisted (car no 59) to take part in it,  and compete against the rally greats is a great honour and after 19 years it's back in Kenya. "To God be the glory! I am trusting God for this rally. I thank Hussein Malik  for giving me the opportunity." Malik and Ayuko were the first casualties on ARC Equator Rally after their Group N Evolution 10 car crashed into a ditch. Damages to the "Version 6" prepared car were somewhat superficial, but Malik is back in the saddle trying to fine-tune it to Safari specifications. Sylvia Vindevogel will be another lady co-driver on Safari. She will navigate Giancarlo Davite who will be running on an Italian Licence. Giancarlo, who is based in Kigali,  was the Rwanda national rally champion in  2008, 2009, and 2011. He won the Rwanda  Mountain  Gorilla  Rally in 2000 and came second in the 2010 and 2011 editions. He has also crowned the KCB East African  Rally champion in  2009 and third in 2010.
