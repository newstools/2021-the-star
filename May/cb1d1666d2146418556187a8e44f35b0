After clocking a personal best of 2:02:57 to win the Milano Marathon on Sunday, Kenya's Titus Ekiru is keen on lowering it to 2:01:00. Ekiru expressed confidence that it is only a matter of time before he lowers his PB as he is currently in the best form of his life. "I will relax for some time when I return home and then sit down with my coach to discuss what's next. You never know, maybe in the future I will be able to run 2:01:00," said the 2019 African Games half marathon winner. Ekiru led a Kenyan 1-2-3 finish as he crossed the line ahead of Reuben Kiprop (2:03:55) and Barnabas Kiptum (2:04:17). It was the fastest time ever run on Italian soil as well as the fastest one for the month of May. Ekiru, who also set a course record at the 2019 Honolulu Marathon, said it was a tough race regardless, noting that the tough competition from other runners had prompted him to up his game. "At 20km, I was already in tune with the race and felt that I was getting better physically as time went by. At 30km, I decided to increase the speed a bit and then at 35k, I felt I could push myself more. I am glad that the strategy worked," Ekiru said. In the women's race, Ethiopia's Hiwot Gebremaryam had to pull out all stops to edge out Kenyan Rachael Jemutai to the tape in 2:19:35 compared to the latter's 2:23:10. Gebremaryam's time was also a new course record. Meanwhile, Kenyan Mark Lomuket ran a personal best of 13:01.68 to topple World 5000m Indoor silver medalist, Ethiopian Selemon Berega to win the men's 5000m race during the Olympic Chase Silver Meeting in Bergamo, Italy. Berega clocked 13:02.47 to finish second whereas Ugandan Oscar Chelimo finished third in 13:06.79. Another Kenyan, Emmanuel Maru finished seventh in 13:50.44. Focus shifts to the Doha Diamond League on May 28 where several Kenyans will be hoping to reap big.
