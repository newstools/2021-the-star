The National Transport and Safety Authority has announced that some of its online services will be interrupted from Thursday. In a statement issued on Thursday, the authority said that the interruption is due to the continuous service improvement strategies. It informed its stakeholders that it will be undertaking upgrade and system maintenance from Thursday evening to Monday. The services to be interrupted include the available services through tims.ntsa.go.ke (Smart DL booking/enrolment, PDL, Test Booking applications, Collection of Logbooks, and Number Plates), which are being hosted on www.ntsa.go.ke. The NTSA Mobile Application and the contact center will also be temporarily inaccessible. The collection of Smart Driving Licences at various centers and services on the Revamped TIMS - timsvirl.ntsa.go.ke will be available to the public. The authority has also started inspecting vehicles that are more than four years old in a move that spells trouble for motorists. The years are calculated from the date of manufacture. This means the National Transport and Safety Authority will inspectÂ almost all vehicles on the roads. There are more than 3.2 million vehicles on Kenyan roads. Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho said NTSA had on May 10 started to enforce the Traffic Act on the inspection of vehicles. Director of Administration at the ministry Paul Famba issued a memo to all heads of departments saying NTSA will enforce Section 16 (2) of the Traffic Act that requires inspection of every vehicle above four years from the date of regardless of ownership.
