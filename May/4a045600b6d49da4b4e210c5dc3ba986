Impeached Wajir Governor Mohammed Abdi has dismissed as unsubstantiated allegations levelled against him by the county assembly. Abdi on Wednesday said the case is politically instigated with malice and is a witch hunt, urging the committee to dismiss the allegations. "I would like to categorically say that I will fully cooperate with the committee and help to establish the truth that charges levelled against me are unsubstantiated, unestablished and do not meet the threshold required for impeachment of a governor," he said. Abdi said that he transformed the county and forged a good working relationship with the county assembly since he was elected in 2017. The county boss submitted that he is an established civil servant who has worked in various capacities, including Cabinet minister but has never been accused of misuse of public resources. The governor made his case moments after the county assembly, led by senior counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi made a case to the Committee to indict the governor. "The governor must be taken out of the political equation in Wajir. The evidence is overwhelming. The facts speak for themselves," the lawyer said.
