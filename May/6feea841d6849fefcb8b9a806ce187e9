IEBC has officially published 669 names of people who applied for the four available commissioner positions in the commission. The names were published in local dailies on Tuesday. In the list, the applicants institutions of higher learning, ID numbers, and their country of origin was showcased. Notable among those who have declared interest include; National Super Alliance CEO Norman Magaya, former NLC Vice Chair Abigael Mbagaya and IEBC Communication Manager Tabitha Mutemi. Others are; former Transition Authority chair Kinuthia Wa Mwangi, former Police Commission member Murshid Abdalla, former Judges and Magistrates Vetting Board Board VC Roseline Odede and KNCHR Chair Kagwiria Mbogori. The IEBC selection panel received 700 applications for the four vacant positions in the commission. However, only 669 applications are valid as some made multiple applications. Last month, the panel said interviews for the shortlisted candidates will be conducted for five days from May 31 and June 4, a timeline the Panel noted could slightly vary given the number of candidates. The Panel hopes to settle on the successful candidates and forward the names to President Uhuru Kenyatta on or about June 9. IEBC is currently operating with three commissioners after the exit of four commissioners after 2017 election. The commission currently has chairman Wafula Chebukati; commissioners Boya Molu and Abdi Guliye after their colleagues resigned. Those who resigned are; Roselyn Akombe, Paul Kurgat, Margaret Mwachanya and Connie Maina.
