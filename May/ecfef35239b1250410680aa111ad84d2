Nairobi City Park market is now ready for occupancy, the Housing department has said. In a notice on Tuesday, the department announced that the rehabilitation works have already been completed. The department said 689 traders that currently trading within the market will be allocated the market spaces (stalls) directly. It went ahead to mention the names of the traders, with their ID numbers and the type of businesses that they were venturing into. The businesses range from groceries, M-Pesa shops, boutiques, cyber cafes, fruit stalls to barbershops. The rehabilitation of the green spaces within Nairobi gained momentum with City Park being the latest to get a facelift. This followed the Michuki Memorial Park's refurbishing. At City Park, there has been a lot of clean up activities. Located off Limuru road between Parklands and Muthaiga and 10 minutes from Nairobi CBD, the park has a rich history. Among those buried in the park include freedom fighter Pio Gama Pinto and the second vice president Joseph Murumbi. The park, which is the oldest having been established in the 1930s, consists of a mixture of native forest trees, cultivated gardens and open spaces for recreation. President Uhuru Kenyatta on June 5 while commemorating the World Environment Day, directed the Environment ministry and the Nairobi Metropolitan Services and KFS to reclaim and conserve the public land.
