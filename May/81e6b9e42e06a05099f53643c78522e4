Popular Mugiithi DJ Muthoni Maina, alias DJ Sonnie, says thriving in a male-dominated career is not easy. Speaking to Word Is over the weekend, she said female DJs are underpaid. "I came to Nairobi to work as a house girl. I was introduced to my 'employer' but that night, alinipea rules mob za nyumba yake and singeweza kuzifuata," she said. "I decided morning ikifika narudi Nakuru (home), and that is what I did. After kurudi home, I got a job kwa milk bar, where I used to sell milk and tea, and I worked there for three weeks. I got paid and used that money to join computer classes." With her computer certificate, she secured a job as CCTV controller in one of the offices in Nakuru. Other hustles she did before becoming a DJ were at a carwash and a salon in Nairobi. "Before then, I also worked at JKIA as a CCTV controller again, but the management changed and I lost my job. Life was tough in the city without a job, and that is how I ended up being a DJ in the industry, " she said, adding that the industry is crazy and judging. "I once got a deal which was paying well and I decided to take it. I shifted to Nyeri two months tuka beef up na boss, and he fired me. I was so much affected," she said. "I'm in a new place where I know no one. I needed to survive but I didn't know how to. Juu ya stress nikaanza kuanguka." Speaking about the challenges, Sonnie said many thought doing Kikuyu music is old-fashioned. "I ignored everything and focused. Female DJs are also underpaid but passion keeps us going." She is currently working with Kameme TV.
