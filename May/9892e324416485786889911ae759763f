Village boys are preying on girls in Grade 4 because the minors are idling at home as they wait for schools to reopen in July. That's the view of an Embu bishop who wants the government to allow Grade 4 learners to resume classes. National Independent Church of Africa bishop Njeru Nyaga says cases of teen pregnancies will increase if the girls continue to stay at home. Grade 4 learners did not reopen early this month after covering their third term between January and March. Nyaga says the longer the children stay at home the higher the risk of them engaging in unwanted behaviour. He said the number of teenage pregnancies has increased in Embu, attributing it to a longer stay at home. Nyaga said parents are occupied with activities to cater for family budgets thus giving chance to children to stray. â€œChildren should go back to school to learn together with others and not only learning the curriculum-based education will benefit the learners but also learning through the discipline offered by their teachers. The government should let the learners resume classes," Nyaga said. He spoke on Sunday during an education event organised by the church.  Edited by P.O
