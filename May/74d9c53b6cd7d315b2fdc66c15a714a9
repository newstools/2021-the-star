Kenya's top-flight league will not travel its full length after all. This is after Football Kenya Federation announced on Monday they were pressed for time and under intense pressure from the Confederation of African Football to unveil the country's representative for the continental showpiece. According to a press release signed by FKF chief executive officer, Barry Otieno, Caf have given the local football body until June 30 to submit the names. “The federation is in receipt of communication from CAF directing that FKF submits Kenya's representatives for the CAF Interclub Competitions, latest June 30, 2021,” read the statement in part. “Consequently, and in consideration that the BetKing Premier League calender may not be concluded before the aforementioned date, due to the disruption occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, the FKF Leagues and Competitions Committee in a meeting held on May 7 resolved that FKF-PL representatives in the CAF Champions League shall be the team at the top of the table as at June 30, 2021," it read.
