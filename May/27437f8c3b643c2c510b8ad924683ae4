A woman has been charged with assaulting her husband’s lover a month after she left their Kangemi home in Nairobi. Margret Wandia is accused of assaulting Jane Wawira on May 14. According to court documents, Wandia had visited her former house to collect some utensils after agreeing with her husband Kimani. “Wandia went into the house and found another woman relaxing in their house,” the documents read on Tuesday. Police said Wandia asked Wawira if she knew that they were still married. “She then asked the complainant to give her the keys to the house so that she could get her belongings including utensils,” the court heard. An argument is said to have ensued which led to the assault. She however denied the charges before Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani who released her on Sh10,000 cash bail. The case will be heard on June 27.
