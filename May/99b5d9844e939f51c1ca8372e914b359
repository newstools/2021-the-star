Nairobi Metropolitan Services will take an inventory of county rental houses and tenants in an effort to collect rent arrears. The county is owed about Sh250 million by its tenants. It has at least 17,000 houses. They are required to clear rent arrears before June 30. NMS will partner with City Hall and KRA in identifying and mapping out the houses by month's end to update the inventory. Occupants will be required to provide the original and copies of their National Identity Cards, rental or tenancy transfer letter, KRA pin, latest payment receipt and other documents. The county has 17,000 houses in Maringo, Uhuru, Kaloleni, Jericho, Buruburu, Kariobangi South, Ziwani and Jerusalem. Tenants pay Sh2,000 to Sh20,000 rent monthly depending on the location. It has houses elsewhere. Over the years, tenants have failed to pay rent, which has reduced revenue collection. The Ann Kananu-led administration recorded Sh292.9 million in housing rents against a target of Sh300 million, from July to December 2020. This was a Sh51 million increase from the previous financial year. In May 2019, City Hall was owed Sh224 million for more than 16,746 houses. Officials said that rent defaulters were the biggest contributors to dwindling revenue collections. Most defaulters were in Maringo and Woodley estates. In October, Governor Mike Sonko waived Sh172 million rent arrears. He aimed to end eviction of tenants by cartels who would allocate housing to other tenants at a fee. A month later, NMS director general Mohammed Badi said Sonko had no authority to issue waivers as NMS had taken over the housing function. AFFORDABLE HOUSING The inventory will help NMS identify houses to be pulled down and replaced in Phase II of the Affordable Housing Programme. In January, Badi’s team announced it will put up  2,000 high-rise rentals and sale units in Eastlands in the second phase of the Nairobi Housing Urban Renewal programme. The public-private partnership project will provide affordable housing with reasonable standards of sanitation. NMS had identified 10 run-down county estates for the project. They are Bahati, Maringo, Jericho, Lumumba, Bondeni, Ziwani, Embakasi, California, Kariobangi North and Woodley. Many are low-rise buildings on large plots of land. The new apartments will consist of six to 16 multi-story buildings with one, two or three bedrooms. Public participation was held in the 10 estates in February. The Bahati Estate project will have 12,000 high-density buildings of six to 16 floors. They will have one, two and three-bedroom units and replace bungalows on the 50.4-acre estate. Another 10,000 units will be constructed in Lumumba Estate; 8,000 units in Maringo Estate; Kariobangi North Estate will have 1,500 units; Embakasi Estate 4,000 units, Bondeni 774 units; California 2,500 units and Woodley Estate 6,000 units . Ziwani Estate will have 4,782 units in eight multi-story buildings. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
