Former 'Machachari' actress Cindy, known to many as 'Mama Stella', has received help in managing her skin condition. Kenyaâ€™s Vitiligo Ambassador Wangui Njee visited Mama Stella at her home and educated her about vitiligo and government programmes that help people with similar conditions. The former MCA also gifted the actress some of the products needed for proper and effective skincare. Njee wrote on Facebook, "I promised to visit Mama Stella from Machachari and encourage her as a person living with vitiligo and I fulfilled my promise. "We met and talked, she is super amazing and funny and I was able to distribute sunscreen and aftersun to her." In her post, Njee appealed to filmmakers to help Mama Stella earn a decent living by offering her roles or opportunities to audition. "We get the sunscreen and after-sun free of charge from the government and they are available in all Level 5 and 4 hospitals across the country." In a past interview, Cindy appealed to Kenyans of goodwill to help her raise Sh150,000 to cater to her medical expenses and upkeep. Vitiligo occurs when pigment-producing cells die or stop functioning. Loss of skin colour can affect any part of the body, including the mouth, hair and eyes. It may be more noticeable in people with darker skin. Vitiligo treatment is expensive, as some people are forced to take medicine for the rest of their lives if they don't want it to spread across their whole body. Njee is a vitiligo champion who visits and creates awareness on the skin condition. In a past interview, she said, "Most people cannot afford the therapy. I give them advice on issues like getting free sunscreen lotions and other matters."
