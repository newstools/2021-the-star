Blogger Robert Alai has denied publishing defamatory articles against Mediheal Hospital and Fertility Centre owned by Kesses MP Swarup Mishra. Alai denied owning or operating a Twitter account, Facebook page, blog and website where the information was published. He was replying to a suit filed against him by the centre. Alai said the posts may have been made by a namesake or an imposter account. “I urge this court to note that in this era of social media there exists many people who share names on social media platforms, while others create pseudo or fake accounts and purport to be someone that they are not,” he said. “Having denied owning or operating the alleged accounts, blogs or websites, it is clear that I have been wrongly enjoined in this suit and the orders sought against me should not be granted.” Last month, the High Court issued orders stopping Alai from publishing defamatory words against Mediheal Hospital and Fertility Center. Justice Msagha Mbogholi granted the order after the hospital argued that Alai was spreading allegations that they are involved in trafficking of human organs. Mediheal said the claims had driven fear in current and potential patients, investors, partners, financiers and donors. The hospital was losing business and opportunities, hurting it irreparably. “Unless a restraining order is issued, Alai will continue to spread malicious falsehoods about the hospital leading to economic loss, and a dented image which for a hospital is quite critical.” The Mediheal Hospital and Fertility Center has facilities in Kenya, Rwanda and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
