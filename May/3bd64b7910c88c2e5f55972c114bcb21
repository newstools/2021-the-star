Churchill Show comedian professor Hamo says Jemutai is not only the mother of his children but his wife. In a Q and A session on Instagram, a fan asked Hamo if he has sorted out his differences with his baby mama. Hamo responded that she is not his baby mama but rather his wife. Another fan asked, "Will you marry Jemutai as your second wife? She is a beautiful woman and a go-getter." The comedian said, "Yes. We have come a long way." Hamo said even though they had a publicised fight, their love will still blossom. "It's people who love each other that fight." Jemutai said she had forgiven Hamo for the agony he caused her. The two lovers made peace with the help of intervention by their boss, Churchill.
