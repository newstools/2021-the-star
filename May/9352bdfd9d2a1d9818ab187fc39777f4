A game-worn jersey belonging to Michael Jordan from his sophomore season at the University of North Carolina was sold for a record $1.38 million (Sh147m) at Heritage Auctions over the weekend. It is the only known jersey photo-matched to Jordan's 1982-83 season with the North Carolina Tar Heels when he was named Sporting News' NCAA Player of the Year. It broke the previous record for a Jordan jersey when a full game-worn Chicago Bulls uniform from Jordan's 1986-87 season was sold for $480,000 (Sh51m)in October, also at Heritage Auctions. "As the final price tag proves, this jersey has everything any serious collector could possibly want," Chris Ivy of Heritage Auctions said. Jordan, a six-time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s, is a Basketball Hall of Famer who owns the Charlotte Hornets. Meanwhile, Russell Westbrook recorded the 181st triple-double of his career, tying Oscar Robertson's all-time NBA record, and hit the game-winning free throws with one second remaining in overtime to lead the Washington Wizards to a 133-132 win over the Indiana Pacers on Saturday in Indianapolis. Westbrook finished with 33 points, including Washington's final two points in regulation on a finger-roll in traffic, and game-highs of 19 rebounds and 15 assists. The Wizards (32-36) overcame a 12-point, fourth-quarter deficit behind Westbrook's history-matching night and 50 points from Bradley Beal. Edmond Sumner hit a mid-range jumper to give Indiana (31-36) a 132-131 lead with 1:03 to go in overtime. Justin Holiday blocked Westbrook's first attempt to recapture the lead in the final seconds of overtime. After a Wizards timeout, Westbrook drew a foul on his jump-shot attempt, and he sank the game-winning foul shots. Caris LeVert scored 35 points for his third game of 30-plus points in the past four and came in clutch for the Pacers in the second half. In another match, Georges Niang tied his career high with 24 points, Jordan Clarkson scored 21 and Bojan Bogdanovic added 20 as Utah Jazz cruised past Houston Rockets 124-116 in Salt Lake City.
