Several Kenya Defence Forces soldiers are feared dead after their patrol vehicle ran over an improvised explosive device at Baure in Lamu East. The IED is suspected to have been planted by al Shabaab militants hiding in Boni Forest. Reports indicate a dozen other soldiers could have been injured in the attack at around 9am Tuesday. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia said the exact number of casualties was unknown. Baure is inside the dense Boni Forest, where for six years the national government has been trying to out flush militants. Operation Linda Boni began in September 2015. The forest stretches from Lamu into Somalia. Macharia said a major security operation is underway following recent attacks and urged calm. â€œI still have no clear information or figures, but we understand the country lost a number of soldiers and others are injured. We do not have accurate details because the area has poor communication and its terrain is rough," Macharia said. Security sources said the soldiers were on routine morning patrol when their vehicle ran over the buried explosive. Two weeks ago on May 3, two people were killed and a third critically injured when their vehicle ran over an IED suspected to have been planted by al Shabaab. The attack occurred close to the Lamu-Somalia border near Border Point 27. On March 23, one person died when a water bowser headed to Usalama Camp ran over an IED. The Kenya-Somalia border wall is being constructed there. (Edited by V. Graham)
