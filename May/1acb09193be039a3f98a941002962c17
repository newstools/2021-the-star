The Migori county government has banned sugar cane hauling tractors with a capacity of over 16 tonnes after the Oria Riat bridge collapsed. Migori Governor Okoth Obado said sugar cane hauling tractors that carry excess loads will be impounded and a fine imposed. “We have already instructed local sugar millers that the order will be effected after a sugar cane hauling tractor was involved in an accident at the Oria Riat bridge at River Kuja,” Obado said. He was speaking at the collapsed bridge on Wednesday morning. Transport was disrupted after the bridge connecting Migori and Homa Bay counties collapsed as a truck ferrying sugar cane to Sukari Industries, a local private sugar miller, was crossing. “We are happy that nobody was injured during the accident. The driver was rescued and is in stable condition, but the bridge has to be rebuilt as it has affected many people,” he said. Residents said the collapse of the bridge will affect students learning at Otange Primary School, Otange Secondary School and Minyere Secondary School. Markets have also been cut off and residents are forced to trek 25 kilometres away to the nearest crossing point. “The river is deep, fast flowing because of heavy rains and it is infested with crocodiles. We want it repaired quickly,” villager Lucas Ong'ong’a said. Residents said the bridge, which was constructed in the 1970s, was narrow and did not have a middle pillar. On April 19, Migori Public Works executive Moses Chamwada wrote to Sukari Industries that trucks transporting sugarcane were affecting ongoing construction of the Uriri-Rapogi-Oria road, which is being upgraded to bitumen standards. “Overloaded tractors are increasingly using the same road leading to increased damage. The road has been designed to carry a permissible maximum axle load of 16 tonnes,” Chamwada said in his letter to Sukari Industries. Edited by A.N
