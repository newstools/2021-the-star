Comedian Prof Hamo no longer works for Royal Media Services-owned station Hot 96. Reports doing the rounds online allege Hamo was fired by Hot 96. The last video Hamo posted while at Hot 96 studio was on March 12, weeks before his parenting scandal with comedian Jemutai surfaced online. Prof Hamo joined Hot 96 back in September 2018 to replace Jalangâ€™o, who had been poached by Milele FM. He has been hosting the breakfast show alongside Jeff Koinange and another show called #TheRush. Other reports indicate Hamo parted ways with Hot 96 willingly following an internal memo from the media house barring employees from running campaigns or appearing on billboards. Speaking to Word Is, Prof Hamo said he is out of town and could not hear our question but promised to respond once he gets a good phone network connection. A few weeks ago, Jemutai called him out, saying he had rejected her and her children and that she is in a financial crisis, seeking help. Hamo later issued a statement on Instagram, saying he has been providing for his children since day one and there is no day they went without basic needs. "My wife sends upkeep for the children who don't live with us. This has been the agreement between my family and the mother of the children." Hamo added that he wished to protect his children and safeguard their privacy and not engage in mudslinging. "Sometimes people can get frustrated when they are not able to get everything they wanted, especially when unseen challenges arise," he said. After a heated exchange of words online, the two decided to sought out the issues privately until yesterday, when Jemutai posted that the comedian had asked for a DNA test to confirm Jemutai's children were his. Jemutai announced the results were out, and there was a 99.9 per cent match between the babies and Prof Hamo.
