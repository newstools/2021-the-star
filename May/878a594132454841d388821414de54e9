IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati now says he will write to DPP Nordin Haji to prosecute Kiambu Governor James Nyoro and his team over the chaos witnessed in Juja on Tuesday night. Speaking on Citizen TV on Wednesday, Chebukati said Haji should arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of the chaos. The electoral agency was forced to suspend vote tallying in Juja constituency after  chaos erupted. Chebukati blamed Nyoro for disrupting the process. The vote tallying resumed on Wednesday, 10 hours after the suspension. "At around 10:20pm tonight there was disruption of the tallying process at Mang’u HighSchool Tallying center in Juja Constituency by a group of individuals led by the KiambuCounty Governor Mr. James Nyoro," Chebukati  said. Earlier, three men stormed the center at Mang'u High school and caused a commotion raising concerns from parties involved. Police intervened and whisked the three away. However a melee ensued between Jubilee candidate Susan Njeri's supporters led by Nyoro and Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba and PEP candidate George Koimburi's supporters led by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata and Witeithie Ward MCA Julius Macharia. Governor Nyoro claimed that votes belonging to Njeri were dumped in a school in Juja calling for a halt of the counting and tallying. Nyoro said that unknown individuals were out to rig the elections in favour of Koimburi. "We don't give a damn! And we, and we don't care," the Kiambu Governor said.
