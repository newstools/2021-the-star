Kenyan champions Gor Mahia enhanced their dream for a 19th title after upsetting hosts Sofapaka 2-1 in a rivetingÂ  Football Kenya Federation Premier League match at Wundanyi Stadium, Taita Taveta County on Thursday. South Sudan international Tito Okello came on the end of Kenneth Muguna's cross to break the deadlock in the 27th minute, effectively putting the visitors in the driving seat. The goal rattled Sofapaka, who immediately launched a counteroffensive. Kenyan international Lawrence Juma almost levelled the terms a couple of minutes later, but his determined effort from a set-piece swerved just inches wide with K'Ogalo's custodian Gad Mathews already beaten. What should have been a good ending for Gor Mahia in the first half turned out to be a disappointment after defender Philemon Otieno was slapped with a yellow card at the stroke of halftime following a reckless play. Sofapaka came back from the break a rejuvenated side, and it wasn't long before their determined efforts bore fruits. Midfielder Titus Achesa restored parity in the 53rd minute to bring the hosts back into the game. A couple of minutes later, Sofapaka's coach Ken Odhiambo effected a double substitution in an attempt to contain the marauding visitors, bringing on Kepha Aswani and Kenga King'atua for Ambrose Sifuna and Nixon Omondi respectively. With a goal still not in sight even after ringing the changes, Odhiambo tinkered his lineup further by introducing Paul Kiongera for Timothy Otieno in the 63rd minute. And in the 74th minute, Gor's Portuguese tactician Vaz Pinto introduced youngster Alpha Onyango for midfielder Karim Abdoul. The decision paid off, given six minutes later, Onyango nodded in Gor's second from Okello's cross. Eager to consolidate the advantage, Pinto brought on midfielder Fred Nkata and centreback Charles Momanyi for Muguna and Frank Odhiambo. Moments later, Nkata collected the second yellow card of the match in stoppage time following an infringement.
