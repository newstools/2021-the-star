Garissa Governor Ali Korane is seeking elders' support to run for a second term. Korane on Tuesday hosted a delegation of about 500 elders from the Adan Gerri community of Abudwak subclan to seek their support. He outlined his achievements ranging from infrastructural development to job creation and empowering youth, women, elders and religious leaders. Korane said he needed a second term to complete the projects he had started. The governor also met elders of Awlihan subclan led by Sultan Hamud Sheikh and those from the Samawadal sub-clan. Elders from different clans in Northeastern play a major role in deciding who to be elected. Korane said the essence of the meeting was, among other things, to get their support as well as get community feedback and reinforce community participatory development. He said he was determined to ensure all communities are well represented and that development reaches all corners of the county. After taking office in 2017, Korane agreed with elders to divide top positions in the county into different clans. The county assembly speaker, the county secretary and the chairperson of the county public service board came from different clans. The governor said he tried his best in his four years in office and was set to achieve more once given another chance. "Last time I was nominated through unanimous decision that was an embodiment of strength, hope and aspiration for all. I have much respect for unity of purpose,'' Korane said. Abdi Mohamed, one of the elders who attended the meeting, said they were impressed by the development record of the governor. "We are unanimously endorsing his second term as the governor of Garissa county in the forthcoming elections,‚Äù he said. Several candidates have already expressed their interest in the governor's seat. They include former governor Nathif Jama, EALA MP Abdikadir Aden and former Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye.  Edited by A.N
