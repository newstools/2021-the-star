Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei has said that the Building Bridges Initiative draft Bill should not be brought back to parliament. Cherargei insisted that if there are any reforms needed, the document should be taken back to the people. The senator in an interview with the NMG said that the court ruling on BBI said that anything touching on constitutional reforms, must start with the people. "I have seen headlines that they want to bring BBI into parliament, let them not bring BBI back to parliament. Parliament has been captured by the state and the few of us who have withstood the tide of BBI has already been overrun by the state capture that is happening in parliament," Cherargei claims. Cherargei is one of the senators who have been against BBI since its inception. In a landmark ruling, the High Court bench led by Justice Joel Ngugi quashed the BBI process, terming the constitutional amendment process illegal, null and void. The judges ruled that the IEBC lacked quorum as stipulated in the law for purposes of carrying out referendum preparations, including verification of signatures, in a judgement that saw them give about 20 reasons why the process was illegal. IEBC has already filed an appeal against the ruling, insisting the judges were wrong and their judgement contradicts an earlier ruling on the commission's composition. "We shall be lodging an appeal in the Court of Appeal and itâ€™s for the simple reason, sometime in 2018, the High Court presided by Justice Okwany made a determination that article 250 of the Constitution is what applies to the Commission," Chebukati said. Proponents of the Bill, Uhuru and Raila are said to have brought together leading legal minds in constitutional law including Siaya Senator James Orengo and Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo as part of the BBI counsel.
