To celebrate World Biodiversity Day, the British High Commission and Wangari Maathai foundation on Friday hosted youth climate and environmental activists at Karura forest in an event aimed at amplifying the voices of young Kenyans and their solutions to mitigating climate change. The event also provided participants the opportunity to learn more about the role of urban green spaces like Karura Forest. Speaking at the event, British Deputy High Commissioner Julius Court said: “The voice of young people around the world is so important. The youth are a powerful catalyst for change and we are deeply committed to involving them in the planning and hosting of the UN climate talks in November.” The event started with an interactive discussion session in the Karura Forest Auditorium with talks centred on the UK-hosted UN climate talks in November and the youths' nature-based solutions to tackling climate change. This was followed by a nature walk through the forest where participants focused on the importance of urban green spaces. The youth participants at the event included students, environmental lawyers, climate journalists and founders of different foundations championing green a revolution. Also present at the event was Wanjira Mathai, the Vice President and Regional Director for Africa at World Resource Institute and Friend of CoP26. Prof Karanja Njoroge, Trustee, Karura Forest Environmental Education Trust  was also present at the event.  The Youth Cafe is the first in a series of events the British High Commission and Wangari Maathai Foundation plan to hold in the run up to the November UN climate talks. The Youth Cafes are one of the ways the UK government is engaging young climate activists to drive climate action in Kenya.
