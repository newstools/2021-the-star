Between 10 and 15 per cent of Covid-19 cases reported in Mombasa are derived from a second test of persons with a previous positive result. The report by the Mombasa county health department shows that the actual numbers might be 10 to 15 per cent lower. The department wants its data cleaned to ensure it reflects the true situation of the Covid-19 burden. As of May 16, the county had reported 11,281 cases out of which 11,186 are local transmission and 95 imported cases. Some 215 people had died with Covid-19, translating to a death rate of 1.9 per cent. Total patients discharged are 9,811, with 1,477 from the health facilities and 8,334 from home-based care. More males have been affected by Covid-19 compared to females. Some 7,646 (67.8 per cent) males and 3,635 (32.2 per cent) females aged 31 to 40 years were most affected. Mombasa health chief officer Khadija Shikely said in a notice that many home-based care doctors lack Covid-19 training. “We still have a large number of doctors and health professionals who are managing patients at home without proper training on Covid-19 and this leads to high risk of virus transmission,” Shikely said. She said that the number of Covid-19 cases is increasing at an alarming rate. It is important for everyone to ensure that the disease is handled with the urgency it requires, she said. Shikely urged health workers who are managing Covid-19 home-based care patients to make sure they register with the health department for training. “Home-based care is a multi-disciplinary approach, so let us work together to have better management, control and better outcome to curb the spread of Covid-19 in Mombasa,” she said. All home-based care patients have been urged to register with their relevant subcounty teams. Mvita subcounty has the highest number of positive Covid-19 cases with 4,415, followed by Jomvu 1,951, Kisauni 1,570, Nyali, 1,472, Likoni, 1,053 and Changamwe, 820cases.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
