The government should put money meant to improve infrastructure in learning institutions in the Constituency Development Fund, Tetu MP James Gichuhi has said. Gichuhi said the money should be taken from the Education ministry and given to the fund overseen by MPs as they understand the problems in their areas better. He said there is a huge chunk of money lying with the principal secretary for Education and should not be left to the PS and the Education Cabinet secretary. “This is because there is no fairness or justice in the distribution of that money,” he said. Gichuhi said MPs understand well the needs of all learning institutions in their constituencies including those that need classes, dorms or offices. He said reports from the ministry showed that some schools received Sh50 million, Sh20 million while others received nothing. Gichuhi spoke when he handed over a 51-seater bus funded by Tetu CDF to Kiandu Secondary School on Friday. The bus was donated as a present following good performance posted by KCSE candidates in the 2020 exams. The day school produced a student with an A- (minus) in the exams. “We recognised that the only way that we can work together with teachers, parents and students to boost their morale is to surprise them with a gift and that is what we have here (a bus),” he said. Tetu CDF is also constructing storey classrooms at the institution. The MP said the road leading to the school will be tarmacked and a basketball court constructed. A parent, Anne Wagaki, expressed her happiness and thanked the MP for paying for the bus and saving them from that burden. John Gatere said the bus came as a  surprise to parents, teachers and learners. He said the students relied on buses from other institutions when going for school trips but the problem is now behind them.
