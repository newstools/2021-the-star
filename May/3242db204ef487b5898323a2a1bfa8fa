Kenyan teams can gain a lot by playing in the Basketball Africa League (BAL), Ulinzi Warriors coach William Balozi has said. Balozi said since Kenyan champions will feature in the next edition of the continental show, he is keenly following the ongoing games in Kigali, Rwanda. “There is so much to be gained by playing in this championship,” Balozi pointed out, adding: “It involves the best clubs in Africa.” “We are aware that for us to be among the participating 12 teams in the next edition, we must first go through the qualifiers and we will give it our best shot.” By virtue of being the 2019 Kenya champions, the soldiers booked themselves a ticket to the qualifying rounds slated to tip-off in September. Balozi said they are waiting for the Premier League to resume to allow them hit the ground running in an effort to carry the country’s flag in the show. “I am watching these games daily on TV and my observations are that playing at such a level needs thorough preparations. We will be very serious once action resumes,” said Balozi. “The standards are high as we can all see from the teams in Kigali. This BAL initiative will no doubt help the growth of basketball in Africa.” The inaugural show, which replaced the FIBA Africa Club Championships, tipped off last Sunday featuring Petro de Luanda (Angola), Zamalek (Egypt), AS Sale, (Morocco), Hoops Rivers (Nigeria), AS.Douness (Senegal), AS Monastir (Tunisia), Petroilers (Algeria), FAP (Cameroon), GNBC (Madagascar), AS Police (Mali), Ferroviaro de Maputo (Mozambique) and hosts Patriots (Rwanda).
