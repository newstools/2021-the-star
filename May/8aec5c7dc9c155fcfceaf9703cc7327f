A Liberian national on remand for the past 18 months has asked for a review of his Sh100,000 bail, saying he is suffering. Emmanuel Dopoe, charged with obtaining  Sh170,000 from a businessman, says his health is poor as he is not used to the food served in remand facilities In a letter to the Kibera law courts, Dopoe says he has failed to raise the Sh200,000 bond or Sh100,000 bail he was granted to secure his release. His lawyer, Ochieng Jaoko, said the bail was harsh and his client was unable to pay. “Our client has been in custody at the Nairobi Industrial Area remand prison for a period of 18 months. Being a foreigner, he is having difficult time in custody as he is not used to the type of food served in our remand facilities,” Ochieng told the court. “The aforesaid is encapsulated by his numerous trips to the health facility facilitated by the prison wardens.” The charge sheet says Dopea and Glay Eric defrauded Francis Mweteri of Sh170,000 to help him clear goods held at the United Nations office. They are also charged with possessing papers that resemble those used in making currency. The two were also found to be in the country illegally. They denied all the charges before a Kibera magistrate. The matter will be mentioned via videolink next week for more directions.
