Retired judge Effie Owuor, the first judge who served in Judiciary, on Monday congratulated Chief Justice Martha Koome as she assumed office. Owuor said she served at a time when there were no toilets for women. Koome said it was through Owuor that many women continue to dream of possibilities. The CJ invited Owuor to speak during her assumption of office. Owuor started by saying it was a great day for Kenya and the Judiciary with every head of department being female. She said there have been many changes in the Judiciary since she first walked in half a century ago as a magistrate. "I didn't know 40 years ago I would speak about my sister who is leading the third arm of government. Back then even a place to go and powder my nose was difficult," Owuor said. She said the CJ at the time had to give up his toilet to make peace between her and male judges. Owuor said some lawyers would refer to her as 'my lady' and she refused that title, telling them she wasn't their lady. "Kenyans have not misplaced their trust. President Uhuru Kenyatta said he was honorued to appoint the first female CJ," she said. "This country has given power to not only a jurist but a friendly person, God-fearing woman and a balanced person. After you retire, I am sure we will say she was a gift." Meanwhile, Kenneth Lusaka, the Speaker of Senate, said Koome is God's choice and equal to the task. He assured that as the legislature, they will support her. AG Kihara Kariuki reminded the CJ that in discharging the mandate that Kenyans have bestowed upon her, the biggest task is to dispense justice. He quoted Quran and asked the CJ to stand firmly for justice.
