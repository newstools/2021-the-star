A Ugandan military court has released on bail 17 people detained five months ago while campaigning for presidential candidate Bobi Wine. The National Unity Platform (NUP) party members were arrested in December 2020 in the island district of Kalangala, a month before the election. They included members of Bobi Wine’s media, security and protocol teams. They are among 49 people arrested and subsequently charged with illegal possession of four rounds of ammunition. This was their third bail application - they were declined before on the grounds that they were potentially dangerous people capable of inciting violence. Eighteen others, who include Bobi Wine’s bodyguard Edward Ssebufu (also known as Eddie Mutwe) and his singing partner Bukeni Ali (also known as Nubian Li), were remanded until 8 June when the court will consider their bail application. Tough bail terms were set for those released. The Chairperson of the Court, Andrew Gutti, barred them from travelling outside the capital, Kampala, and Wakiso, a district that encircles it. Each are subject to a non-cash bond of 20m Ugandan shillings ($5,600, £3,900) while those who stood as their sureties to a non-cash bond of 50m Ugandan shillings to be paid should they abscond. They are also required to report to the court twice a month. NUP lawyer Benjamin Katana says about 97 party supporters are facing charges in different courts across the country. President Yoweri Museveni, 76, was sworn in earlier this month for his sixth elected term, after winning January's disputed poll.
