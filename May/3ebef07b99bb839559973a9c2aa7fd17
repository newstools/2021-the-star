Jamleck Muturi has officially taken over as the Teacher’s Service Commission Chairperson, replacing Lydia Nzomo whose six-year term came to an end in November 2020. Jamleck reported to his new office on Wednesday morning and was received by TSC CEO Nancy Macharia. His appointment was gazetted by President Uhuru Kenyatta on April 29 for a term of six years. He took the oath of office on Monday which was presided by Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu. Muturi was sworn in alongside Timon Oyucho who had been appointed by the President as a member of TSC for a term of six years. The President had nominated Muturi and Oyucho in March, and the matter was referred by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to the Education Committee for vetting. Nzomo was the first person to chair the TSC after it was made a constitutional commission. She took the oath of office in 2014. Oyucho had served as a TSC lawyer until his appointment. He led cases against Knut and was instrumental in neutralising the giant teacher’s union.
