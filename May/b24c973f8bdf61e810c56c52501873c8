Diamond Platnumz's half-sister Esma has thanked the singer for helping her with the upkeep of her kids. Esma said her celebrity baby daddy Petit is deadbeat. "I do everything by myself. I raise my daughter by myself, I thank God that since she was three months to now that she's six years, I have raised her. I cannot blame anyone because this is my child. I struggle for my children," she told Wasafi Media. Esma revealed that Tahiya, her eldest daughter, is taken care of by Diamond Platnumz, who pays school fees and upkeep. 'He says that's his firstborn. I have given that child to him already," Esma said. Esma, who runs a clothing line, says she is independent and content even without getting upkeep from the men she has sired her two kids with.
