Gospel star and mother of two Mercy Masika had a rough time during her first pregnancy, her husband David Muguro has said. Speaking in a recent YouTube interview with Picha Clear Films, Muguro said her struggles made them sleep on the floor of their new house. "Mercy could not stand the smell of wood or blankets at their new house, hence making them shift to the sitting room," he said. "She did not want to see anyone, including her sister. They used to irritate her and nothing made her happy." "We went to the clinic and we were told to be taking walks. She would then come and demand that I take her for the walks. "But the minute we started walking, something would happen. She would say the winds are too much, the people are too many, among other things." He added that the only thing she wanted was eggs. "The advice from people was too much on why she couldnâ€™t eat eggs. The confusion of never having been there and not knowing who to ask was too much," he recounted. David added that they had Somali neighbours and Mercy could not stand their perfumes, so they agreed they can only do their laundry at night. Luckily for them, the woman agreed, and that helped a little. During the interview, Mercy said she did not want to have kids after an aunt painted a gory photo of how painful childbirth is. During my first pregnancy, I was induced as I was in labour the whole night. "I was so scared as I was waiting for pain like what I see in movies but that did not happen," she said. "I was like 'uui watakurarua?' As a child you think, giving birth is such drama? I did not know how I gave birth. I only had some diarrhoea and some vomiting. "I threw up a lot and it was not fun. I could not sleep in my bedroom as the blankets and the smell of wood from my cupboard would irritate me. I also could not stand the smell of onions. I also had to use a particular bed sheet."
