Vihiga Queens will honour their match against Eldoret Falcons despite the latter saying they won't play, coach Alex Alumira has said. Falcons have indicated that they will be unable to host their opponents because players have not been vaccinated against Covid-19, according to club chairman Joshua Ariko. "The federation knows our situation because we have informed them. Our players have not been vaccinated and it is impossible to play on Sunday," Ariko said. However,Â  Alumira wants the fixture to go on as planned. "My team is prepared and ready to play after a long time and we will be there for the action. we were informed of the fixture early enough and I believe the match will go on," said the Queens' coach, who has won the last three league titles. The already-relegated Falcons have lost all their 10 matches and have zero points. Ariko has appealed to corporates to salvage the team from the financial crisis despite their poor run. Falcons also dished out the first walkover against Oserian midway in the season to add to the team's unending problems. Queens, on the other hand, have already secured a playoff as they seek to win their fourth consecutive title. The county-sponsored team has 28 points having registered only one draw against Nakuru West Queens.
