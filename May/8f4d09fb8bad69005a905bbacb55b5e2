Former US president Barrack Obama's family has mourned their Portuguese Water Dog, Bo who died of cancer. "Today our family lost a true friend and loyal companion. For more than a decade, Bo was a constant, gentle presence in our lives—happy to see us on our good days, our bad days, and everyday in between," Obama said. Via social media on Saturday evening, Obama said Bo tolerated all the fuss that came with being in the White House. "...had a big bark but no bite, loved to jump in the pool in the summer, was unflappable with children, lived for scraps around the dinner table, and had great hair," he said. "He was exactly what we needed and more than we ever expected. We will miss him dearly." Bo arrived at the White House as a 6-month-old puppy in April 2009. This was a gift from Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and his wife, Victoria, to the first children, Malia and Sasha Obama. The Obama's named the dog Bo because their cousins had a cat with the same name . Also, Michelle Obama’s father was nicknamed Diddley, after the musician Bo Diddley. The former first lady said :"This afternoon was a difficult one for our family. We said goodbye to our best friend—Bo—after a battle with cancer." She added:"We are grateful for the love you showed him over the years. Please hug the furry members of your family a little closer tonight—and give them a belly rub from us." Via a post on his Twitter, Michelle said that although Bo was originally supposed to be a companion for Malia and Sasha, “We had no idea how much he would mean to all of us.” "The dog had been a constant, comforting presence in our lives sauntering into their offices like he owned the place, a ball clamped firmly in his teeth,” she said. He was there for the traditional Easter egg roll on the South Lawn and when the pope came to visit, she said.
