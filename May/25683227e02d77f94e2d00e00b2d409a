Central Organization of Trade Unions Secretary-General, Francis Atwoli has rubbished claims that the signpost of road named after him was removed. In a statement on Friday, the Cotu boss said people should stop wasting time celebrating fake news. "Nothing was removed to make you happy, don’t waste your time celebrating fake news! God’s wish is Paramount," Atwoli said. His statement comes hours after reports that residents of Kileleshwa had removed the signpost erected on Thursday. A picture of the signpost on a lorry circulated on social media fuelling speculations that it had been vandalized. The Nairobi County Government named a road after Atwoli, in a ceremony led by the acting governor, Ann Kananu alongside other county officials. "I want to thank the leadership of Nairobi County, under @annkananu_ , for this great honour and recognition of services to the Government of the day, the community and Worker's at large," Atwoli said. The road in Kileleshwa, near Kenya High School, was formerly called Dik Dik Road. In June 2017, the National Addressing System Strategy Development and Implementation Committee proposed new rules prohibiting the use of names of living persons. The rules abolished any changes to existing street names. The proposed guidelines said the Cabinet Secretary for information and communications through the Communications Authority of Kenya, would have oversight responsibility regarding the national policy and standards on street-naming and property numbering. County governments would so be responsible for the implementation of the project renaming at the county level.
