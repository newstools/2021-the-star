Despite her serious face, it was a relief to see her smile as she officially took over the Judiciary leadership on Monday. Martha Koome, the first woman Chief Justice in Kenya, broke the glass ceiling after she was nominated by the Judicial Service Commission that interviewed ten candidates. Her assumption of office comes with a lot of promised reforms: employment of more judges and handling all cases in or under three years. This comes after 162 days of the Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu being in charge. It is a relief for the girl child whilst fighting for equal opportunities and especially during this hard time of the pandemic. With a lot of optimism, she took the advice given to her by former Chief Justice David Maraga. The Attorney General encouraged her to be as aggressive in fighting for justice in a way that everyone feels her leadership. It was a competitive space and we are happy to see a woman in such a position of leadership. She is not alone. Philomena Mwilu, the Deputy Chief Justice and Anne Amadi, the Chief Registrar of the Judiciary, are rallying behind her. We now hope to see a lot of changes in the judicial system. The present and the future is really women.  Wangari Njoroge Moi University Eldoret  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
