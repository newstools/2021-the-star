National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi has found Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro culpable of disorderly conduct. This follows the lawmaker's sentiments pointing to some MPs as sellouts, cowards, and conmen. The speaker on Thursday said any member was at liberty to move a motion for the suspension of the member. Speaker Muturi however exonerated Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria after the latter denied saying MPs were bribed to vote for BBI. Majority whip Emmanuel Wangwe moved a motion to suspend the member. Deputy Whip Maoka Maore seconded the motion after the speaker invoked Standing Orders 108. The MP will be barred from the precincts of the House, including his office for four days. Muturi urged MPs to treat one another with respect and avoid incidents that disparage any member. "Any utterances that disparages a member affects not only the member but the entire House. You wouldn't want to be part of the very House whose standing you have put into disrepute," the speaker said. Nyoro made the utterances during the Constitution Amendment Bill, 2020 vote last Thursday, and restated the same on Wednesday saying he had evidence members were compromised. Former Majority leader Aden Duale asked Nyoro to take lessons from Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi who was suspended in 2015 for leading a whistle protest at President Uhuru Kenyatta state of nation address. The MP can only be 'forgiven' by the Powers and Privileges Committee. The suspension means loss of privileges.
