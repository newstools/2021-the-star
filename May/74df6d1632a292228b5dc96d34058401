The Employment and Labour Relations court in Nyeri has suspended the removal of two members of Nyandarua County Assembly Service Board until a case filed by the duo is heard and determined. Justice David Ngugi ordered Nyandarua county assembly not to declare the positions vacant after Njoki Mureithi and Fr David Munyeki challenged their ouster. The judge issued temporary conservatory orders suspending gazette notice No 4596 published on May 4 removing the two from office. In the application filed against the county assembly with the board enjoined as an interested party, the two sought interim orders stopping the respondents from degazetting them or declaring their positions vacant. The two were ejected from office on allegations of absconding duties. They sought to have the two entities barred from recruiting or deploying any person to fill their positions. The assembly was ordered to make and file a response within five days and an inter-parties hearing date set for May 19. “The respondents and contemners are hereby given five calendar days to make, file and serve a response to this application,” the judge said. This deepens the wrangles at the Nyandarua county assembly whose speaker, Ndegwa Wahome, has been ousted three times in less than four months. The latest impeachment was last Saturday through a special sitting called purposely to eject the outspoken lawyer. The MCAs kicked out their speaker despite being reinstated by the High Court in Nakuru with an order barring them from ejecting him within six months of the court decision. Wahome has never accessed his office since December last year.
