Celebrated media personality Larry Madowo's dream was to become a Catholic priest. He had enrolled at the Saint Gabriel’s Seminary in Kisumu, where he undertook his O-Level Education. Madowo changed his mind about joining the priesthood and instead enrolled for a communications degree at Daystar University after high school. He told Evan-Lee Courie in an interview, “I ended up working in broadcast by accident. I thought I would be a lawyer or a Catholic priest, but I was clearly not cut out for either. "Then I imagined I would be a writer but instead, I got a traineeship position on TV at KTN Kenya when I was just 20. It started my love for television, travel and Twitter. Now I can’t imagine doing anything else.” Larry is currently working for CNN as a correspondent based in Nairobi.
