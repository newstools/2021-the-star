Former Kenya Sevens rugby player Alex Olaba will be remanded at Industrial area GK Prisons until his gang rape case is heard and determined. Magistrate Zainab Abdul on Monday cancelled initial bond terms issued to Olaba when he was first charged with the gang rape case. The magistrate said witness interference by an accused person is something that cannot be taken lightly. The prosecution had asked the court to cancel Olaba's bond terms after he was charged with conspiring to murder the complainant/main witness in his gang rape case. Olaba followed the proceedings virtually. Olaba was last Monday arraigned before Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi and charged with conspiring to kill a key witness in his gang rape case. Court documents say on diverse dates between April 14 and 22 within Nairobi county, jointly with others not before the court, Olaba conspired to kill a witness initialled in the charge sheet as K.A. Olaba also faced a second charge of conspiring to defeat justice. The prosecution said on April 22, he interfered with the trial process in the gang rape matter by attempting to cause the death of the key witness, K.A.
