The details of Arror and Kimwarer dams will be known in the fullness of time. It seems there is a conspiracy by the movers of power that this matter must not and cannot be known for now. It is true that President Uhuru Kenyatta and Jubilee would want the facts and file on the matter to be known right now to disparage Deputy President William Ruto, but that has not been done. If it was the intent of the government to have the former Treasury Cabinet secretary exposed, then it would have happened. It is not about whether Kenyattaâ€™s administration or Jubilee-allied forces want to tell us about Kimwarer and Arror. The thing is, are we serious, are we clear and sincere about transparency and reliability with respect to principles of governance and the rule of law? If we want to be true and real about Kimwarer and Arror, then we must be true as well about the health sector scandals, including at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority, to the Galana-Kulalu irrigation scheme. Kemsa must matter, Arror and Kimwarer must matter, Galana Kulalu must matter too. This matter should not be about witch-hunting a particular ministry or the Deputy President. The Jubilee government under President Kenyatta must be held to account for the limitation and follies of governance. We cannot blame Ruto or Uhuru but the Jubilee government as a whole. We must ask ourselves to what extent has the Jubilee administration, under Uhuru, let down Kenyans? Uhuru, Ruto and all the Cabinet secretaries must be blamed. Article 232 of the Constitution on values and principles of Public Service must apply to every person in the public service. Political affiliation matter the least.
