The Nyeri government has partnered with Aquaculture Business Development Programme to promote ‘eat more fish campaign’ in the county. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said through the campaign, residents are educated on the health benefits of eating fish. Residents are also taught how to cook and eat fish. The campaign also seeks to increase the number of fish consumers in the county and raise the demand for fish in the county. Some 438 small-scale fish farmers have also benefited from aquaculture inputs like liners, fencing materials, aquaculture hand book and fish menu books, donated by ADBP. "To enhance county fisheries, the programme will support them with cool boxes, harvesting nets and life saver jackets," Kahiga said. The governor said Wamagana fish factory is being privatised to enhance public private producer partnership. He spoke during the Annual Aquaculture Day celebrations held at Wambugu Agricultural Training Centre in Nyeri on Thursday. The day will be commemorated every May 20 in all the 15 ABDP implementing counties. Nyeri is one of them. The day is meant to create forums for stakeholders to exchange knowledge and skills, and showcase aquaculture innovations along the various aquaculture value chain. This year’s event was themed "Fish for All, All for Fish". "The day will reflect on the strides made in aquaculture sector farmed fish, in regard to increased fish production and productivity and adoption of new aquaculture technologies such as raised pond and aquaponics," Kahiga said. Others are the adoption of climate smart aquaculture, such as the use of lined ponds in porous soil areas and dry areas and to increase knowledge in fish farming. Also present were Kenya Fisheries Services director general Daniel Ndung'u, county Agriculture CEC James Wachihi, Kenya Fisheries Service board chairman Gonzi Rai and vice chairperson Jessica Gakinya.
