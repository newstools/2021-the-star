Nairobi, Nakuru, Turkana, Kiambu and Kilifi counties will get the lion’s share of the Sh370 billion allocated to all the 47 devolved units in 2021-22. Nairobi gets Sh19.24 billion, up from Sh15.91 billion this year; Nakuru receives Sh13.02 billion compared to Sh10.47 billion; Turkana will get Sh12.60 million against the S10.53 it got in 2020-21. Kiambu and Turkana will get Sh11.71 billion and Sh11.64 billion, respectively,  compared to Sh9.43 billion and Sh10.44 billion they received in the current financial year. The allocations are contained in the County Allocation of Revenue Bill, 2021. The Bill was tabled in the Senate for first reading on Tuesday by House Budget and Finance committee chairman Charles Kibiru (Kirinyaga). The proposed law allocates the Sh370 billion allocated to counties in the Division of Revenue Act, 2021. According to the Bill, Lamu, Tharaka Nithi, Elgeyo Marakwet, Vihiga and Nyamira will get the smallest allocutions, though with marginal increases compared to their current allocations. Lamu has been allocated Sh3.10 billion against Sh2.59 million it received this year; Tharaka Nithi will get Sh4.21 billion, up from Sh3.92 billion, and Elgeyo Marakwet gets Sh4.60 million, compared to Sh3.86 million this year. Vihiga and Nyamira get Sh5.06 billion and Sh5.13 million, up from Sh4.65 billion and Sh4.81 billio, respectively, if Parliament approves the Bill. The allocations are based on the third basis for revenue allocation passed by Parliament last year after months of a stand-off in the Senate. The senators had clashed bitterly as factions whose counties would lose revenue in the proposed formula putting up a spirited fight. It took the intervention of President Uhuru Kenyatta to pledge an additional Sh53.5 billion in share of revenue to ensure no county lost cash. “It is expected with successful implementation of the Third Basis from FY 2021-22 to 2024-25, county governments will now be able to plan, budget and spend in accordance with the areas of needs as envisaged in the formula as well as achieve their development needs,” The Bill reads. The formula provides for an eight-parameter formula, with the greatest weight placed on basic share (20 per cent), population (18 per cent), health (17 per cent), poverty level (14 per cent) and agriculture (10 per cent). Other parameters are land size (eight per cent), roads (eight per cent) and urban area (five per cent). Other big gainers in the Bill are Kakamega, which will get additional Sh1.9 billion, Bungoma (Sh1.7 billion), Uasin Gishu (Sh1.7 billion), Nandi (Sh1.6 billion), Kitui (Sh1.5 billion) and Kajiado (1.5 billion). Baringo, Bomet, Bungoma, Busia and Embu will get Sh6.36 billion, Sh6.69 billion, Sh10.65 billion, Sh5.12 billion, respectively. Others are Kakamega (Sh12.33 billion), Kajiado (Sh7.95 billion), Kericho (Sh6.43 billion), Kisumu (Sh8.02 billion), Kwale (Sh8.26 billion) and Meru (Sh9.49 billion). Siaya gets Sh6.96 billion, Narok Sh8.84 billion, Migori Sh8 billion, Mombasa Sh7.56 billion, Murang'a Sh7.18 billion and Nyeri Sh6.22 billion. “The proposals contained in the Bill take into account the fiscal framework set out in the budget policy statement for financial year 2021-22 and are intended to ensure fiscal sustainability,” the Bill reads.
