New signing Curtis Wekesa scored the all-important goal in the 40th minute as KCB edged Ulinzi Stars 1-0 in a friendly match at Lanet grounds in Nakuru. The outcome was a big relief for the bankers who are sharpening their teeth ahead of a crucial top-of-the-table Football Kenya Federation Premier League tie against Tusker at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on May 15. Tusker sit pretty at the summit of the log with 33 points, four ahead of the bankers who are placed second. On Wednesday, KCB head coach Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno said they had their eyes fully trained on clinching their maiden top-flight title. Their last league encounter was against Zoo Kericho at Utalii Grounds, Nairobi where they drew 1-1. And despite his counterpart at Ulinzi Stars Benjamin Nyangweso pleading for more time to prepare his side well enough before competition can resume, Zico said they were ready for action. “Time is never enough. It is upon us as individual coaches to try and do what is required. Nobody will be a hundred percent fit,” said Zico. Nyangweso had earlier in the week urged FKF to give top-flight teams at least two weeks to put their house in order before the league can resume. “All FKF-PL sides took a break from physical training after President Uhuru Kenyatta imposed a ban on sporting activities and our players are now too rusty to even start thinking of competing,” said Nyangweso. Nyangweso spoke to the Star hours after FKF announced they had put tentative plans in place to roll out top-tier fixtures on May 12.
