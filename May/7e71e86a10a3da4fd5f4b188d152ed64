Muslim believers are nearing the end of their fasting season, Ramadan. Believers did their last prayers of the holy month of Ramadan on Friday in different parts of the country before marking Idd-ul-Fitr next week. To celebrate the end of Ramadan with our Muslim brothers and sisters, the government declared next Friday a public holiday to mark Idd-ul-Fitr. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i in a gazette notice declared May 14 a public holiday in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2 (1) of the Public Holidays Act. The festival of Idd-ul-Fitr, the Festival of Fast-breaking, is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. Muslims celebrate Idd-ul-Fitr with prayers called "Salat Al Eid" in Arabic. Muslims will gather in mosques or open spaces and offer two units of prayer â€“ called "Rakat". The prayers are followed by a sermon, in which the imam asks for forgiveness, mercy, and peace for every being across the world.
