The trial of impeached Wajir Governor Mohammed Abdi in the Senate begins on Wednesday. The special Committee investigating the ouster said Wajir MCAs will lay their case on Wednesday before the governor takes the stand to defend himself on Thursday. The parties have been given until close of business on Tuesday to file their papers. They will also required to submit names of at most three witnesses they intend to use in the case. Committee chairman Okong'o Omogeni said the panel will then retreat on Friday to consider the submissions and file a report. They plan to table the report on May 17. "On Thursday, the governor will make his response to the charges as drafted by the county assembly and evidence provided. There will also be cross examination of the governor by the assembly lawyers," Omogeni said. Wajir MCAs impeached Governor Abdi two weeks ago for alleged gross misconduct, gross violation of the constitution and abuse of office.
