Police on Monday dispersed a meeting of prospective aspirants for DP William Ruto-backed UDA party at a Meru hotel. The area police boss said the aspirants had no permit to hold the town hall meeting. It all begun when a police officer asked the aspirants to follow the ministry of health protocols. But they kept claiming that they were in a hotel and did not warrant any response from the police. “We are in a hotel. You can’t tell us to get out of here. Are we not in a hotel?” They were heard asking. “Why are the police being used like this? Another was heard asking. As the confusion ensued, the area police boss arrived at the scene. “What is the meeting for? Do you have a permit from the police?  What you are doing here is wrong. Do you have a permit?” The police boss said as he spoke to SG Veronica Maina who was the convener. “This Is not allowed! He said adding that holding a meeting without the letter was not allowed. As the aspirants complained,  Maina told the police boss that she was a lawyer and did not need a permit for the meeting. “..I am a lawyer..let me call the registrar of political parties.. we don’t need a letter for this,” She said. But before she could answer, the police boss asked the aspirants to disperse immediately. “Stand up and go to other duties. Stand and leave! Go home right away before we throw tear gas at you,” the police boss said. “Leave.. I have said you need to leave.” But the crowd kept complaining saying they were also Kenyans. Even as the complaints rented the air, the aspirants stood up hurriedly as others asked if there was tea for them. They took their luggage and left the meeting hall.
