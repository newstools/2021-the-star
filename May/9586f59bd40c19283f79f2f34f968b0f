Deputy President William Ruto’s UDA party has launched a major membership recruitment drive in Rift Valley region where he is seeking to win three million new members to back him in 2022. Registration is free an can be done online to reach as many people as possible. So far the party has registered more than 300,000 members in Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Nakuru, Nandi, Elgeyo Marakwet, Turkana, Kericho, Bommet and Baringo counties. “We started two weeks ago and it's going well, with very high interest by residents of the region to be party of our national UDA movement, UDA Uasin Gishu coordinator Paul Kiprop said. Kiprop, who is a former chairman of the Wareng county council and a close ally of the DP, said UDA was a mass movement because of its plan to better the welfare of poor Kenyans in the next government. “The DP has been very clear on his agenda to put Kenyans first and that is why his thinking resonates well with very many Kenyans," Kiprop said. He said they had put in place structures up to the ward level to ensure registration is smooth. UDA plans to open a regional office known as the Hustlers Centre of North Rift to coordinate all all party activities in the eight North Rift counties. Another Hustlers Centre will be opened in Nakuru for South Rift. MPs who are also close allies of the DP and aspirants for the UDA ticket are mobilising residents to register as members. “UDA is the way to go and that is why we have Kenyans across the country registering en masse to join the party. It’s a party for all Kenyans," Soy MP Caleb Kositany said. The MPs have severed almost all links with the Jubilee Party through which they were elected. Jubilee has faced internal wrangles pitting two factions against each other, one supporting the DP, the other President Uhuru Kenyatta. Two weeks ago, the DP said UDA was his next option because Jubilee had been hijacked by people interested in wrecking it. He said UDA was a party of the Jubilee coalition. However, Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju wrote to the Registrar of Political Parties seeking to withdraw from completion of the coalition arrangement with UDA. The matter has not been resolved. (Edited by V. Graham)                                                    76yxz045rrrrrrrrrrrr- ty13*&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& Zy67pllllllllll
