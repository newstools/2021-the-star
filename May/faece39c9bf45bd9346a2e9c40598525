Political pressure continues to pile on Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo as he awaits the approval of his deputy governor nominee by the county assembly. A section of Nyamira leaders have called on the county boss to go for an alternative nominee even as he maintains that he will stick to his choice. Recently, ODM party proposed Charles Rigoro as the deputy governor nominee, but Rigoro was not considered by the governor. Most of the leaders have urged the MCAs to approve James Gesami as the deputy governor after the wrangles witnessed between the county assembly and the executive. “We have been taking our time in trying to convince the governor to go for an alternative person for the position. This might be a solution to unending wrangles in the devolved unit,” an MP, who did not want to be named, said on Monday. “It seems the governor is fully convinced on the capability of his nominee in terms of service delivery.” Nyaribo and MCAs met a month ago in the neighbouring Kisii county and ironed out their differences and promised to join hands and work for the residents. Nyamira governor has, however, maintained that he will stick to his deputy governor nominee despite pressure to drop him. He said the MCAs are the ones behind his mess of operating without a deputy governor. He cautioned them against ganging up with some elected MPs in undermining his leadership, threatening to block the MCAs from accessing the assembly. “The MCAs are the main challenge in the whole process of having a deputy governor. I will stick to my choice and if the MCAs continue with the drama, then we will not have an alternative but to bar them from accessing the assembly,”  Nyaribo said.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
