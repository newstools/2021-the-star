Nigerian musician Chidinma Ekile has quit secular music to become a crusader of Jesus Christ. Her Instagram handle has "I am a minister of Christ" written all over it. Her profile on the platform now reads: "I am an end-time soldier. My message is Jesus." Some of her hit songs are 'Kedike' and 'Yanga'. In one of her posts, she asked people to pray big prayers as God can do exceedingly and abundantly more than what we ask for. "A woman with a past can touch God in the present who is able to change the future. You can lack a shoulder to lean on but you will never lack a ground to kneel on and pray."
