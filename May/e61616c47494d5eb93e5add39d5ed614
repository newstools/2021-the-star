Having already qualified for the playoffs, high-flying Thika Queens are hungry to finish the league unbeaten for the second time when they take on Makolanders on Saturday, chairman Fredrick Chege has said. The Zone 'A' leaders are in imperious form having amassed 30 points from 10 matches and will be keen to extend their faultless run at Stima grounds as the Women's Premier League enters the homestretch. Thika won their first league title in an unbeaten run in 2016 under coach Richard Kanyi and the team has always looked the part despite competition from current champions Vihiga Queens. "It is a nice feeling to have qualified for the playoffs with four matches. Our aim is to finish the season undefeated like in 2016. We have a lot to play for and the team will fight for maximum points in all the remaining matches," he said. At the same venue, second-placed Ulinzi will tackle tail-enders Mathare Women. Ulinzi, the WPL newbies have had a fruitful season under coach Joseph Mwanza and will be fighting for their eighth win of the season. Mathare are staring at relegation should fortunes not change. Mid-table teams Kayole Starlets and Zetech Sparks have a date at Ruiru grounds. Placed fourth and fifth respectively, the pair are separated by two points. Gatundu-based Gaspo Women will savour their chances at the Ligi Ndogo grounds hoping to get the better of Ramadhan Vijago's Kibera Soccer Ladies. Redhot Ruth Chebungei will look to add to her 13 goal tally this season when she leads Wadadia's attack against Oserian in one of the three Zone 'B' matches scheduled for this weekend. WPL first-timers, Nakuru West Queens welcome Kisumu All Starlets. The reverse fixture saw the two teams register a scoreless draw and whoever wins this encounter will be firmly in the grip for a playoff slot. Nakuru have 18 points to rank third â€” one behind their opponents. In another match, SEP Oyugis play Trans-Nzoia Falcons.
