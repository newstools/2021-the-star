Naivasha residents took to the streets to protest against the decision by their MP Jayne Kihara to reject the BBI Bill in Parliament. With Naivasha to get two extra constituencies from the law changes, the residents accused the MP of focusing on politics instead of development. Through their political, religious and women leaders, the residents held a peaceful demonstration through the streets of the town before addressing the press. Kihara who is a close ally of DP William Ruto was among MPs from Rift Valley who voted against the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Political leader Ndegwa Nguthiru said the BBI changes would benefit Naivasha residents. He noted that Naivasha was one of the largest constituencies in the country, with the highest population, hence its division timely. “We want to disassociate ourselves with Kihara who decided to reject the BBI Bill without consulting the people who voted her into office,” he said. Nguthiru added that the handshake had brought peace and stability in the country, adding that Naivasha residents were behind the government and the President. Maendeleo ya Wanawake  Naivasha chairperson Esther Nyokabi faulted the MP's move. She said Naivasha was one of the beneficiaries of the BBI, adding that they were confident the Bill would pass during the referendum. “We voted for our MP to represent our interest in Parliament but she has decided to go in the opposite direction,” she said. Youth representative Alvin Maiyo the legislator's actions do not speak for the constituency as they were behind BBI. “It’s wrong for our MP to use her political interests to vote against a document that will benefit hundreds of Naivasha residents,” he said. -Edited by SKanyara
