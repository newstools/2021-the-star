Bomet county will discontinue support for needy students who perform poorly in the course of their studies, Governor Hillary Barchok has said. The governor said there have been cases of sponsored students failing to meet expected targets in the examinations despite the county investing in them by catering for their needs while in school. Noting it was wrong for a students receiving full scholarship to perform dismally in the national examination, the county chief said his administration will start monitoring all beneficiaries to ensure they post good results. Barchok said the county was spending a lot on the students by ensuring prompt payment of fees but some end up misusing the privilege, hence the need to stop the support and divert it to other hardworking learners. “It is not right for a student who has been picked from among hundreds of others as a beneficiary, to misuse the opportunity by not attaining the best grades. That is why we have said we are going to stop their support,” he said. “From now on, we shall be asking school heads to furnish us with the report cards of sponsored students so that those who fail to accomplish their targets lose the funding.” Barchok was speaking when he received the top performers in the 2020 KCSE exam from across the county. His remark came following reports that some of the sponsored 2020 KCSE exam candidates scored D grades. The governor said the selection process of needy cases will soon start, with the number set to increase from four to 10 from each of the 25 wards. Urging the needy students to apply for the scholarships, Barchok said the scheme targets only the underprivileged. Among those invited was the best improved student nationally Dennis Cheruiyot from Kimargis Secondary School in Bomet Central. He had a B-, despite having scored 190 marks in the KCPE exam. -Edited by SKanyara
