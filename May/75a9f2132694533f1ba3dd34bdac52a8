National boxing team head coach Benjamin Musa has implored his charges to refine their speed, precision and movement as preparations for Tokyo Olympics enter the homestretch. Musa spoke on Monday after 19 Hit Squad members were subjected to the mandatory Covid-19 tests at Moi Stadium, Kasarani, ahead of a planned bubble training camp. “We came back from Russia with a lot of expertise. The tournament gave us ample time and opportunity to gauge our boxers and rectify some glaring shortcomings,” said Musa. Four Kenyan boxers participated in the nine-day Konstatin Korotkov International Boxing Championship in Russia where they flexed muscles with some of the best Tokyo-bound European champions. The Tokyo-bound quartet returned home from Russia with three trophies and two bronze medals after finishing the tournament as the second-best African team, behind Morocco. “There was a lot of improvement compared to the Africa Zone 3 Championships in Congo. We still have a number of areas to work on for the remaining one month before we travel for the games,” said Musa. Musa said he had observed some marked improvement in his charges and more so the Africa Zone 3 Boxing Championship gold medalist Elly Ajowi, whom he is convinced has made great strides in gaining both composure and confidence. “Ajowi looked more relaxed and confident in Russia compared with how he was in Congo," said Musa adding that captain Nick Okoth now looks better in the ring against south pole opponents. “Nick also showed some brilliant techniques against a south pole opponent. During his first bout with a south pole opponent, he struggled a lot. But this time round, he dealt with his opponent quite impressively and only a slight mistake cost him the bout," said Musa. Musa hopes they'll get a chance to compete in one more tournament before their trip to Tokyo.
