 Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru on Tuesday disbursed Sh32.8 million as bursaries to assist needy students in secondary schools, colleges and universities. Some 7,867 beneficiaries are in secondary school, 1,514 in colleges and 1,195 are university students. Waiguru said the funds will enable students to remain in school as the new term begins. “My government remains committed to supporting the education of our children, the improvement of academic performance in our county and ultimately, the lives of our youth,” Waiguru said. She spoke at her residence where she issued the bursary cheques to the beneficiaries. She said the beneficiaries were identified through a vetting process by bursary committees. The governor said the bursary will also assist students from vulnerable households that were badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Waiguru encouraged the beneficiaries to work hard. The disbursement was the last tranche of this year’s bursary allocation of Sh113 million that will benefit 40,000 students. Waiguru said the county government will continue to support needy students. She said about Sh150 million has been allocated for bursary in the next financial year.  Edited by P.O
