Kenyatta National Hospital will from July close its doors to walk in patients and attend to referrals only. This comes as the Nairobi Metropolitan Services is set to open all its 24 hospitals to the public. Nairobi Metropolitan Service director general Mohammed Badi on Wednesday  said his team together with the Ministry of Health have reviewed the referral system strategy within Kenya. “To implement this strategy and Nairobi being the pilot, effective from July Kenyatta National Hospital will close its doors to walk-in patients,” he added. This means that all Level 5 , 4 and 3 hospitals within Nairobi will now move in to cater for all walk-in patients in the county. Badi added that in partnership with acting Governor Ann Kananu, all efforts will be done to ensure that all the 24 hospitals as pledged by President Uhuru Kenyatta will be fully operational. President Uhuru Kenyatta had earlier noted that construction of the 24 hospitals proved development can be made accessible anywhere in Nairobi with very little money. “The Public can now access health services without having to travel all the way to Kenyatta National Hospital and I am proud of the good work NMS director-general Major General Mohamed Badi and his team  have done in building these facilities in remote areas within Nairobi," he said. Last year in August, Uhuru directed Badi to construct 24 health facilities at a cost of Sh2 billion. The additional hospitals were to help reduce the burden in KNH , Mama Lucy, Pumwani and  Mbagathi hospitals. NMS was mandated to build 19 health facilities each for Sh70 million and  five would be rehabilitated for Sh300 million. Ten out of the new facilities are Level 2 hospitals while the rest are level 3. Uhuru has already commissioned four of the 24 hospitals; the Uthiru-Muthua Hospital is a level 3 while the other three — Kiamaiko, Soweto and Ushirika — are Level 2 facilities (dispensaries).
