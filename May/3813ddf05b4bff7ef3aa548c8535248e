Nyamira senator Okong'o Omogeni will chair the 11-member committee formed to investigate charges against impeached Wajir Governor Mohammed Abdi. The committee members unanimously elected the senior counsel soon after the House approved the formation of the team on Thursday. Nakuru senator Susan Kihika was elected the vice chairperson of the committee. Senators Sakaja Johnson (Nairobi), Mwangi Githiomi (Nyandarua), Christine Zawadi (nominated) and Mithika Linturi (Meru) will sit in the committee. Other members are Hargura Godana (Marsabit), Fredrick Outa (Kisumu), Agnes Muthama (Machakos), Petronilla Were (nominated) and Issa Juma (Kwale). The panel will investigate the allegations leveled against the governor by the MCAs who voted to impeach him last Tuesday. Some 37 out of 47 MCAs voted to impeach the county boss for alleged gross misconduct, gross violation of the constitution and abuse of office. Earlier, a total of 28 voted in favour of the committee route, 14 voted in favour of plenary while Siaya Senator James Orengo abstained. “In accordance with chapter 6 of the Constitution Article 73, I want to declare a conflicting interest. I happen to have acted against this governor in a petition before the Supreme Court. “Therefore, for that reason at the time when my name will be called, I'll abstain based on having acted against him,” Orengo said.
