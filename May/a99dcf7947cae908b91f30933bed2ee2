A 26-year-old man drowned himself in a borehole at their home at Karia-ini village in Lari subcounty following a disagreement with his girlfriend on Monday. He reportedly suspected his girlfriend had started dating another man, and it had become difficult to get a date from her. Resident Samuel Kimani said the couple had exchanged of insults before the man drowned. Lari deputy sub county police commander Charles Opondo said the man was discovered in  the 80-feet deep borehole by relatives, who started screaming attracting the public. “Our officers visited the scene and called the fire brigade to assist us in retrieving the body,” Opondo said. The police boss said they have started investigations to establish what really caused the man to drown himself or if he accidentally  in the borehole. Locals led by Voice of Men and Children have condemned the action and urged young people not to act out of anger. Vomec national chairman Bishop James Njenga said young people, especially boys, don't have mentors as most men have become drunkards. “We are in a crisis as a community especially in Kiambu county. Very few men are counselling their children, especially boys because they are still abusing dangerous drinks. What advise can such people give to our youth?” Njenga posed. He urged clerics to start a campaign to encourage young men to seek help from the church to live positively. “When people go to church, they make good decisions, take time to think, they do not abuse alcohol or other drugs and at the end, our society will be rich with people who can give advise and nature others,” he said.
