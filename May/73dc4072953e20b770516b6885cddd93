The US has announced the suspension of its security assistance that has been benefiting the Malian Security and Defense Forces following the detention of the transitional leaders. The US Department of State’s spokesperson NED Price said in a statement on Wednesday that the US has strongly condemned the current situation in Mali. “We are now suspending the security assistance that benefits the Malian Security and Defense Forces that we had continued previously pursuant to available security,” part of the statement reads. The US will also consider targeted measures against the political and military leaders who participated in impeding Mali’s civilian-led transition to democratic governance. Mali interim President Bah Ndaw, Prime Minister Moctar Ouane, and Defence minister Souleymane Doucoure were on Monday arrested and taken to a military base in Kati outside Bamako, hours after two members of the military lost their positions in a government reshuffle. They were released on Thursday, as the former junta Col Assimi Goïta declared himself the country's transitional president. The US has also said that it supports the decision made by African Union and ECOWAS and that it is working closely with the local transition monitoring committee and other international actors to seek an immediate solution, including restoration of a civilian-led transition. It further said that the democratic civilian-led government presents the best opportunity to achieve security and prosperity of the country as well as the region. The US said that the Malian transition government’s commitment to a civilian-led transition and democratic elections in 2022 had set the stage for Mali’s continued engagements with international partners to advance democracy, human rights, peace and security efforts.
