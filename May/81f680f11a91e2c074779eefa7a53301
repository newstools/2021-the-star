Being silent is not being foolish. Is owning property in this country a problem? These were the words of former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko a day after the EACC said he was part of a multi-million shilling graft probe. The anti-graft agency told lawmakers on Tuesday that Sonko was among county bosses who accumulated wealth but cannot explain how they made Sh11.5 billion. The others include former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, impeached Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu and Samburu county boss Moses Lenolkulal. "I started owning, buying and selling property when I was in school and before I became the Governor. Mutashangaa...... labda muulize hao wengine," Sonko said in his defence on Twitter on Wednesday. "Kwani what have you done to the former @EACCKenya boss who was involved in the Kemsa Covid Billionaires scandal? What have you done to one of your current bosses who was involved in the grabbing of a County school playground in South C?" Sonko went ahead to ask what had been done to EACC's former and current bosses who were involved in the fraudulent sale of Integrity Centre. EACC chairman Eliud Wabukala said the commission is chasing unexplained Sh500 million held by Lenolkulal and Sh8 billion by Kidero. Last year, Sonko was charged with the loss of Sh357 million from City Hall. “For honourable Waititu, former governor for Kiambu, EACC is looking for something like Sh2 billion and for honourable Sonko, former governor for Nairobi, EACC is looking for something like Sh1 billion,” Wabukala said. The four have all denied EACC's claims that they acquired the wealth illegally. The chairman spoke during a meeting with the Senate Justice and Legal Affairs Committee to discuss the status of the fight against corruption by the agency.
