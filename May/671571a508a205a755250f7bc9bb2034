Impeached Wajir Governor Mohammed Abdi has received order stopping the swearing-in of his deputy as county chief. In a notice on Tuesday, the court suspended the swearing-in of Ahmed Mukhtar as the governor. "That pending the hearing and determination of this application ..the court be pleased to grant a conservatory order restraining the 4th interested party from gazzeting the date, time and place of taking the oath of office..." it read. The courts certified the document as urgent pending the hearing and determination of the case filed by Abdi. However, the order was obtained after Mukhtar had already been sworn-in. Mukhtar was on Tuesday afternoon sworn-in as Wajir governor. Mukhtar, 39, assumed office following the impeachment of Abdi on Monday. Speaking at the county headquarters moments after taking the oath of office that was conducted by High Court judge Said Chitembwe, Mukhtar promised to prioritise key sectors of  health, education and water that he said were ailing. “As I assume office today, I am fully aware of the full responsibility that has been bestowed upon me. The people of Wajir are craving for efficiency and  good governance. I will strive to do my best in that regard,” said Mukhtar.
