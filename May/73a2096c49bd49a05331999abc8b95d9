Al Jazeera journalist Catherine Soi has paid tribute to her husband and former KTN sports presenter Robert Soi, who died on Wednesday. In a tweet, she said her heart is broken ‘into a million pieces’ following the untimely demise of her lover. “My heart is broken into a million pieces. He was always our Roberto. Will forever be my Robs. My person has gone and I thank God he went knowing I've always had his back no matter what," she said. "Rest with the angels, baby. Say hi to our dads. I'll see you there @R_SOI.” Robert died at the Nairobi Hospital after spending a week in the ICU. A close source told Word Is he had been scheduled for surgery at the time of his death. The veteran sports anchor built his career at KTN in the early 2000s before moving to CGTN.
