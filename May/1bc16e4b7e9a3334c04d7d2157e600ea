ODM party leader Raila Odinga has received an award from Mizani Africa for his contribution towards achieving democracy in Kenya. Raila was also honoured on Thursday for promoting national cohesion and integration for the greater good of the Kenyan nation. Also awarded was Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir. Raila has received countless praise for coming together with president Uhuru Kenyatta to create peace in the country through a handshake. The handshake deal of March 9, 2018, ended six months of hostilities between Jubilee and Nasa following the disputed 2017 presidential elections. The handshake has caught many international eyes  as the two leaders were invited to the United States of America (USA) to deliver a talk about it. “The handshake is a unique thing and other people want to hear more about it,” Raila said when announcing about the invitation.
