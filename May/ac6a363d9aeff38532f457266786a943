The Anti-Corruption Court has ordered Nakuru West MP Samuel Arama who was acquitted of graft charges in 2019 to be placed on his defense. Magistrate Felix Kombo had acquitted Arama and two others saying they had no case to answer. However, Justice James Wakiaga on May 20 ruled they be put on their defense. Wakiaga said Kombo erred both in law and fact when he arrived at his decision to acquit the three. Arama was acquitted alongside Charles Birundu and Kennedy Onkoba. Two other suspects, Muiru Mwaura and Daniel Nyantika, were put on their defense Wakiaga said it was clear that the magistrate erred as there was adequate evidence presented before the court which would have warranted putting the accused persons on their defense. The judge said they should explain how a land title was registered in Arama’s name. “I hereby order that the lower court file no ACC No. 20/2021 be placed before the Chief Magistrate Anti-Corruption court who shall assign the same to another magistrate rather than Felix Kombo for further trial and determination,” Wakiaga ruled. The DPP had appealed the ruling by Kombo to acquit the accused. Justice Wakiaga allowed his appeal and ordered that the accused be placed on their defense ruling that the burden of proof by the DPP is on a balance of probability and not reasonable doubt. “I have noted from the record of proceedings and the ruling that it did take into account the evidence on the relationship between the accused herein before the date of the alleged transfer of the property,” Wakiaga said. He also held that the magistrate did not consider the evidence on how Arama forcefully took possession of the suit property. The DPP had argued that the trial court did not consider that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proof by establishing its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The case will be mentioned before chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti on June 15 for allocation to another magistrate.  Edited by P.O
