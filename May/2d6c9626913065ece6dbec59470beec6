Nyamira residents will be forced to wait longer to have a Deputy Governor  after the High Court halted the vetting of Dr James Gesami for the post which was scheduled for this Friday. The order was issued on Thursday hours to Gesami’s vetting by the county assembly’s appointments committee. A petition challenging  Gesami’s suitability for the post was filed by a resident, Patrick Atambo on  March 8, 2021. “It is hereby ordered that the interim conservatory order be and is hereby issued staying the process of nomination and or processing a nominee to the office of a Deputy Governor, County Government of Nyamira pending the hearing and determination of the application,” stated the order. This could further sink the hopes of the ex-West Mugirango legislator of becoming a deputy governor in the Amos Nyaribo-led county government. Speaker Moffat Teya, while in an interview in a local vernacular radio station on Thursday evening, said the order caught him by surprise as the Assembly and the mandated committee had put everything in place for the exercise. He however said he would obey the court orders and that dates will be announced later after the hearing and determination of the case on  June 8. “The order has caught me unaware, my office received it Thursday, it’s a surprise to me as everything had been put in place ready to vet Gesami for the DG post. We will have to wait until  June 8 for the determination of the case filed by a resident,” added Teya. This is the second time Gesami was set to face the appointments committee panel  after the first one was unsuccessful after he failed to present some crucial documents. -Edited by SKanyara
