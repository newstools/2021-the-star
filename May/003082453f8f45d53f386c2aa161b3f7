Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o has given property owners 100 per cent waiver of all outstanding interest and penalties on land rates. This is to cushion them from the effects of the Covid-19 crisis. The waiver is valid from May 17 to June 18. This was announced in an advert in the local dailies signed by county finance boss George Okong'o. "Governor Nyong'o is pleased to announce to all property owners a 100 per cent waiver on all outstanding interests and penalties on land rates," he said. Okong'o urged all property owners to take advantage of the waiver to clear outstanding arrears. He said the original amount will be reinstated and legal redress shall be instituted when the time elapses. "Take advantage of this waiver and avoid further penalties," the announcement reads. The finance boss said deposit slips have to be presented to subcounty revenue officers for database updates.
