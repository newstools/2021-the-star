Police in Homa Bay are looking for people who abandoned a car ferrying bhang at Ngegu market in Rangwe constituency on Thursday. At least 605 rolls of bhang with a street value of Sh65, 500 were found inside the vehicle. Homa Bay county police commander Esther Seroney said the rolls were stashed inside the boot of the vehicle. Details of the destination of the vehicle and where it had travelled from were still unclear. The vehicle stayed in the market for more than the expected duration for a strange vehicle. This made some residents suspect that something was wrong with it. They notified police at Rangwe police station who impounded it and the bhang. “The concerned residents liaised with our officers who rushed to the scene and found the narcotic drug in the vehicle,” Seroney said. It is suspected that the drug peddler abandoned the car because it had developed a puncture in one of its wheels. Seroney said they were looking for the owner of the car who is expected to reveal the persons who were transporting the drug. “Investigations are going on to help apprehend the suspects,” Seroney added. The vehicle was towed to Homa Bay police station where the bhang was kept to be used as evidence against the suspects who are on the run. Edited by Henry Makori
