The Kenya Bureau of Standards has confiscated unbranded pressure pipes and waste pipes manufactured by Vintz Limited and Astral Limited in Oloitoktok town, Kajiado County. “The pipes are certified but Kebs stickers had not been branded on the pipes as per the requirement of the standard,” Kebs said. Kebs adopted five new standards to boost the safety and quality of food additives in the market early this month. Kebs' Managing Director Bernard Njiraini said that the newly approved standards will provide a basis to ascertain the quality, purity, and safety of the food additives. Njiraini had also said that the Standardisation Mark permit, which is a mandatory requirement for placement of goods in the Kenyan market, is issued to manufacturers for products that have complied with established standards. “Under the revised SM scheme, the issuance of Standardisation Mark Permits will be based on factory inspection and product sampling for laboratory tests, “said Njiraini. KEBS has developed a guideline document for remote assessment activities to complement the traditional on-site assessment activities during extraordinary events or circumstances such as the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic as part of the business continuity strategy.
