The Migori county Kenya National Union of Teachers has endorsed a lineup crafted to kick out nominated MP Wilson Sossion as secretary general of the trade union. On Wednesday, the council that brings together Migori, Rongo, Kuria East and Kuria West branches said it will support Collins Henry Oyu who seeks to unseat Sossion in June polls. Oyu is from the Nyanza region and so is Kennedy Nyamwanda who was also endorsed for the assistant national treasurer post. “We have crafted a team that will bring synergy and revamp all the 110 branches that have collapsed because of bad leadership by Sossion,” said Paul Girwa, the council treasurer. Girwa blamed Sossion leadership for the mass exodus of members. He said the union boss has a bad relationship with the Teachers Service Commission. “Sossion used the position of the secretary general to auction teachers from the country for his personal gain; we will work on sending him home,” Girwa said. Caleb Opondi, the county secretary general, said the move to back the two comes with a team crafted in all regions nationally. “We have created a team from all regions in the country for a regional balance that will change the leadership to revamp the union,” he said. In the team's proposal, the national chairman slot will go to Patrick Karinga from Central, the national treasurer will be James Ndiko from Eastern, the deputy secretary general will be Otieno Agola from Nairobi, while the first vice national chairman will be Stanley Mutai from Rift Valley.
