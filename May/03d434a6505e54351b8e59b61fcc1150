Relegation-threatened Makolanders will play their hearts out when they take on Thika Queens in the Women's Premier League, coach Mike Okang'a has said. The women's league is set to resume on May 22 and Makolanders, who are second from bottom on the table in Zone 'A', have their work cut out against an unbeaten Richard Kanyi-tutored side at Stima grounds. Makolanders have won just two matches in 10, with two draws and six defeats to muster just eight points and leaving the team in dire need for points in their battle against the axe. Before action was halted, Thika were on the rampage, scoring 37 goals and conceding just nine times to become the league's best scorers and second-best in defence. Defending champions Vihiga Queens' have conceded just five goals. In the first leg encounter between the two teams, Makolanders lost 2-0 but Okang'a believes his side can put in a better performance. With just four matches left, the tactician believes getting a result against Thika could be a turning point. "We will tackle every match with belief that we can win. Thika are undefeated but that does not mean they are a superior side. They conceded four against Zetech but finally won. Anything is possible. My players must fight to the death if we are to save our season," he said. "No team is in shape owing to lack of training but this won't be an excuse. My  focus is to try and make the girls match ready." Elsewhere, bottom-placed Mathare United will face Ulinzi Starlets on the same day. A day later, Zetech Sparks will entertain Kayole Starlets as Kibera Soccer play  Gatundu-based Gaspo.
