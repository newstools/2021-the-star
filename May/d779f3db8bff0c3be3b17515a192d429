Diamond's baby mama Zari Hassan has thrown shade at former Miss Tanzania Wema Sepetu over a recent comment she made about her. A fan reached out to Zari on Instagram with reports that Wema had talked ill of her weeks after Zari said she was clout-chasing by reporting that her dog had gone missing. "Zari mbwa wako hajapotea kama wa Wema? Alafu wema alikujibu vibaya BossLady," posted the fan. Zari fired back, stating that she can offer the actress some free food because the actress is too slim. "It's Ramadahan na natoa msada. She could use some free food, naona kabakisha kichwa tu. Iyo njaa, let her eat some food, she will be fine." In a quick rejoinder, Wema hit back, saying she was brought up well and taught not to argue with her elders. "Kugombana na watu wazima ni kujitafutia laana... Na mimi nina heshima sana kwa wakubwa zangu... Pia ni mskivu... Nafanyia kazi ushauri." This is not the first time Zari and Wema are embroiled in a public fallout. A few years ago, Zari alleged that Wema broke her marriage with Diamond. She said the act of Diamond getting cosy and showing an intimate closeness with Wema at a music launch party was one of the reasons she dumped Diamond. "Diamond and I have broken up. In other words, it is done! I blocked him since videos showing him cosying up to his ex-girlfriend went viral online." Wema once said she used to envy Zari Hassan when she hooked up with Diamond Platnumz after their breakup as she felt like Zari was living her dream life with Diamond.
