Controversial bishop and political commentator Godfrey Migwi has joined politics and is set to seek an elective post in 2022. According to a billboard post, the House of Hope minister Migwi will be vying for the Mathioya parliamentary seat, which is currently held by Peter Kimari. Speaking to Word Is on Tuesday, Migwi said he wants to be a voice for the voiceless in society, adding that he will continue serving in the church. "One of the many things I am planning to do is building the technical institute for our youths and also heavily supporting the education system," he said. "I will ensure there are new classrooms and renovate those that are damaged and make sure that any child of our constituency, poor or rich, will be in school, learning." It is not clear which party Migwi will use for his stab in politics. He promised to mention that later. He becomes the third candidate to declare his interest in the seat after the current MP Kimari and former MP Clement Wambugu. Migwi hosted a religious show, ‘Kwenjera uma wa mandiko’ (Analysing the truth of the word), every Wednesday on Kameme Radio alongside man Nyari and Kamlesh before he was sacked a few years ago. Bishop Migwi is one of the clerics who have been campaigning against the Building Bridges Initiative, and he has from time to time called out leaders who support the bill. A few months ago, he called on President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga to stop forcing the BBI referendum on Kenyans. He said they should instead give Kenyans copies of the report to read and understand its contents and what it means for them. Other notable clerics to join politics include Pastor Pius Muiru and Bishop Margret Wanjiru. Speaking about his relationship with Deputy President William Ruto, Migwi said they are friends and he will support him politically.
