Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has gazetted a special sitting of the Senate on Monday to consider a House Committee report on the impeachment of Wajir Governor Mohammed Abdi. Lusaka published the sitting in a gazette notice on Thursday. The senatorial impeachment Committee chaired by Nyamira senator Okong'o Omogeni retreats Friday to file a report on the investigation of the Governor's impeachment ahead of Monday's sitting. The hearing on the impeachment case was concluded on Thursday evening. Thursday’s session started at 10.20 am with the second witnesses for the county assembly taking the stand for cross-examination. MCA Ahmed Bare testified on Wednesday but could not be cross-examined by the Governor's lawyers because time had elapsed. In his submission, Bare who seconded the impeachment motion against the governor in the county assembly alleged the governor's wife and children were involved in the procurement irregularities that now threatens to sink the county boss. Wajir MCAs on Wednesday sought to place the wife and children of embattled Governor Abdi at the center of what they called a "tender graft web" that threatens to ensnare him. In a blow-by-blow account, the MCAs detailed how Kheira Omar Maalim— the governor’s wife whom they described as the ultimate leader and de facto authority — allegedly has been influencing tenders and receiving kickbacks.
