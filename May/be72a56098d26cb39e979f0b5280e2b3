Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has said he will defend his gubernatorial seat in 2022. Kiraitu who spoke in an interview with a vernacular TV station said he feels strong and will be back to his official duties next week. The governor has not been in the public limelight after he went into isolation and specialized treatment after contracting Covid-19 on March 19. Some of his political opponents have asked him to retire from politics and leave it for the young. Calls for Kiraitu to quit running in 2022  increased after he was diagnosed with Covid-19. “People should not get tired of me let them carry their disabled person who would show them the way,” he said. Kiraitu who has never lost for six consecutive elections said in 2022 he will campaign as if it was his last. “There is no other campaign, I will be more vigour,” Kiraitu said. On the installation of Speaker of National Assembly  Justin Muturi as Mount Kenya spokesman Kiraitu said Muturi is qualified. “He is more qualified than others who have shown interest. People should stop being jealous,” Kiraitu said. He dismissed rumours that Muturi is possibly being groomed by President Uhuru Kenyatta to succeed him. Kiraitu said there is a need for Meru to form its own political party and they are working out on a new outfit to accommodate the Meru bargaining power in the national political arena. On the BBI, Kiraitu said the country needs constitutional amendments no matter how long it will take following a recent court ruling terming BBI unconstitutional.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
