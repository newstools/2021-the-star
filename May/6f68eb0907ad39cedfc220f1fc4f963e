The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has said that it will appeal the ruling stopping it from conducting a referendum due to lack of quorum. Speaking in Juja on Monday, IEBC chairman, Wafula Chebukati, said the commission will file an appeal on the ruling made on Thursday last week. "As a commission we have engaged our lawyers and discussions are ongoing... in the course of this week, we shall be lodging an appeal in the Court of Appeal and it’s for the simple reason, sometime in 2018, the High Court presided by Justice Okwany made a determination that article 250 of the Constitution is what applies to the Commission," he said. "It applies to all commissions and independent commissions and states clearly that we should have a minimum of three commissioners and a maximum of nine." The ruling by a five-judge bench led by led by Justice Joel Ngugi on Thursday said that the IEBC lacked quorum as stipulated in the law for purposes of carrying out referendum preparations, including verification of signatures. The bench issued a permanent injunction restraining IEBC from conducting the referendum. According to the judges,  the commission requires at least five commissioners to make quorum, not three as its currently constituted. In August 2018, Justice Okwany dismissed a petition that challenged the IEBC's composition following the resignation of four commissioners. The High Court judge said the commission could not be termed unconstitutional because some commissioners had resigned. "No evidence has been produced to show that the president received their resignation notices in writing," said Okwany.
