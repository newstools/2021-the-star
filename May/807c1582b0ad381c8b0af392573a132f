A Kibera court has allowed the police to continue holding an assault suspect. Police constable Teresia Wambui filed an affidavit, saying she was investigating a case of murder that resulted from an act of assault. Benjamin Semeiyan was arrested on suspicion of being part of a gang that assaulted a caretaker at a construction site after an argument. David Nyongesa Wakhungu, aka Kolombia, was attacked on June 18, 2020, at a construction site in Ngarusa village, Kajiado county, after a disagreement. He died at Kajiado Level 5 Hospital. A postmortem showed he succumbed to his head injuries due to blunt object trauma. Wambui asked to detain Semeiyan for 14 days. Court prosecutor Allan Mogere told the court that the days were important for the detectives to do conclusive investigations. Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto granted the order. The detective told the court that the deceased was working as a caretaker at a construction site at Ngarusa village together with others. She told the court that Kolombia was assaulted and killed after an argument. “An argument began between the deceased person and his colleagues which culminated to him being assaulted by the crude weapons and he succumbed to his injuries,” the detective said. She told the court that chief pathologist Johansen Oduor did the postmortem and found out that he died by a blunt object that caused head trauma. The detective told the court that the suspect was among the people who attacked Kolombia, hence she wanted him to help them arrest more suspects. She also sought 14 days to do a search at the suspect's house to make more recoveries and take him for a psychiatric test. Kuto granted the order and directed that the matter be mentioned at the end of the period.
