Harambee Stars left-back Eric ‘Marcelo' Ouma says he has been inspired to step on the gas pedal after receiving reports that three English Premier League clubs are keen on securing his signature. In an interview with Fotbolldirekt, Ouma confirmed he was aware of talks surrounding his future at the Swedish top-tier club, AIK, but maintained no talks had been opened for a possible transfer deal. “I've been made aware of the fact that three English Premier League sides have been following up on my performance. That can only serve to motivate me to keep going. I believe hard work is what attracts them to me. In the meantime, I'm focused on giving out the best on the pitch to enable my team to win matches,” Ouma said. Scouts from three English premiership clubs were deployed to keep tabs on his performance during their league match against Hammarby a couple of weeks ago. Amid the transfer speculations, the player's agent Ibrahim Jamal said they would definitely consider making a move should the offer tabled prove to be enticing enough.
