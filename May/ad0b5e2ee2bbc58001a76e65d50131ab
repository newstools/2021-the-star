Unionised lecturers at Kisii University on Wednesday began a strike to push management to honour a slew of collective bargaining agreement dated some of them dated back 2013. At least three CBAs are yet to be honoured according to union officials. The union issued a notice on Wednesday to all lecturers to boycott classes until the university cedes to their demands. "The decision to get this far is largely due to the failure by the university to honour the pact on paying us the money," said George Andima, UASU, Kisii University branch boss. The lecturers want the university to meet all the 'tenets of all signed internal CBA dated 2013-2017' before they return to class. The university management is further accused of failing to remit staff cash to Saccos, banks, insurance and pensions. "We have engaged the University Vice Chancellor John Akama severally on the matter but to no avail. At a certain point during the meeting, Akama denied knowledge of the collective bargaining agreement. He denied denied knowledge of the documents yet it was signed by union officials and the government. This is sick ," said Andima. UASU Secretary General Dr Charles Mukwana told Kisii University Vice Chancellor Prof John Akama to quit. He said he has no moral authority to continue amid failure to pay the lecturers what rightfully belongs to them. Mukwaya said the picketing will continue daily until the 'university begins to respect the rights of workers'. He said the CBA was negotiated nationally from which the university received Sh6.6 billion which should be used to pay the lecturers.
