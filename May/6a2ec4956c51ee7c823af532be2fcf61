A woman is fighting for her life in hospital after nine dogs attacked and mauled her on Friday night in Kitengela. The woman, according to eyewitnesses, was attacked a few metres from her home as she walked from the market at 8pm. Her neighbour, Wilson Kisemei, was informed by residents of the attack and when he arrived at the scene, he and found that the woman was still breathing. “She had been attacked badly and her left hand was mauled and the flesh eaten by the dogs. I rushed her to Kenyatta National Hospital,” Kisemei said. He said the middle-aged woman was attacked by nine canines and was saved by a passerby who used stones and sticks to fight the dogs. After the woman was rushed to KNH, residents descended on the dogs and killed four out of the nine. Other dogs disappeared into the darkness in the expansive Nkurrunka area. The woman’s husband was at the KNH on Saturday morning to sign an approval for the amputation of one hand as the doctors said she had been placed in ICU.
