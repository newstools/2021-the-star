The UK has pledged to continue supporting counties that make up the Lake Region Economic Bloc. Kisii county has already benefited from the partnership between Kenya and the UK after receiving funding for the construction of a safe open air market in Daraja Mbili. The market is complete and ready for use. On Monday, Kisii Governor James Ongwae held a meeting with UK Deputy High Commissioner Julius Court and UK Defence adviser Brigadier Ronnie Westerman. The meeting was part of a continuous engagement that has attracted various programmes, particularly the Sustainable Urban Economic Development Programme, which has transformed many municipalities in the country. “One of the achievements of LREB has been the direct export of fresh produce like bananas and vegetables from the region to the UK,” Ongwae said. As a result of this cooperation, Kenya Airways has committed to provide cargo freight services to transport the products to the UK. Ongwae, also the vice chair of the bloc, appreciated key achievements of the bloc that followed his visit to the UK and the signing of an MoU by President Uhuru Kenyatta last year. The governor appealed to the UK government to support a bill in the Senate that seeks to give regional blocs legal identity so they can benefit from the joint ventures. Ongwae also weighed in on the Kenya-UK alliance on workforce development in the health sector. Through the partnership between Kenya and the UK, Kisii University and Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital are expected to benefit from training arrangements and exchange programmes. The envoy called on governors from the region to make use of the newly built Kisumu port. Devolution across the counties has attracted various development partnerships that have transformed counties in the country.
