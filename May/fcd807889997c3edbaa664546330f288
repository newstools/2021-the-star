Chief Justice nominee Martha Koome on Thursday recommended legislative intervention to help resolve the stalemate among the three arms of the government. Koome said there is need to have harmony between the Judiciary, Legislature and Executive. She however noted that the current set up does not offer a middle ground to bring the arms together in case of conflict. Appearing before the vetting panel -Justice and Legal Affairs Committee - the Court of Appeal judge told MPs to consider coming up with a Bill to create an arbitration body. "There is no organ to help us with the stalemates. We should work together on a Bill to create an organ to enhance working relationship and in case of stalemate deal with it," Koome said. "I am very good at negotiations and a peacemaker, I will employ all my skills." The CJ nominee also dismissed four affidavits filed with the Committee against her nomination. Some seven affidavits were also filed in support of the former Fida chairperson nomination to succeed retired Chief Justice David Maraga. On the BBI proposal to create a Judiciary Ombudsman, Koome told the Committee chaired by Kangema MP Muturi Kigano that she is open to any intervention that will ensure accountable and efficient judiciary. Koome told MPs that she is against the push to lower the sexual age of consent. Koome said the age for sexual responsibility should remain at 18 years which is the international standard."Anyone under the age of 18 years is a minor and should be treated as a child who still requires guidance and care," she said. "I will not recommend lowering the age for sexual responsibility."
