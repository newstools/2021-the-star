Coast-based singer, Nyota Ndogo has explained why her Danish husband Henning Nielsen was angry over the pregnancy prank she played on April Fool's Day. Speaking in a Live Instagram interview with Mpasho, the mother of two said her husband was agitated by her pregnancy prank because they had not agreed on having children. According to Nyota, Nielsen did not want to have children since he felt that her two children and his own three children were enough. “We talked about having children, he said we have five of them, we don't need another one. By five children, he meant my daughter and son, and his own three children," she said. "He then argued that he is an adult, with grandchildren. He said, ‘I want when I retire and come to Kenya, we travel all over the world, and not baby sitting’." Nyota Ndogo recounted how she pranked her husband only for the prank to go wrong. “We used to talk twice a day. So I called him in the morning, I remember he was brushing his teeth, I told him I was pregnant. He said ‘Hmm! What?’ then hung up. I did not say anything else.” Nyota earlier on begged her husband to come back to her or else she will die single. “Please come back to me. Mimi hata sio pesa, nalilia love. Nilikua na act don’t care cause nakula nalala vizuri najilipia bills zangu mwenyewe, but one thing nakosa from you ni love. Kumbe pesa sio kila kitu, muimu kupata mtu unaempenda na wewe kwako nimefika mwisho, yaani kama hurudi ntajifia single." She added in another post that she will not get tired of begging her husband to give her attention. She said the Dane has blocked her and the only option left is to call him on social media, hoping he will come across her plea when it goes viral. In an interview, the 'Watu na Viatu' hitmaker said her Danish husband was also set to permanently relocate to Kenya.
