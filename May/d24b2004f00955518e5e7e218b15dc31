Schools, which opened for the 2020 third term on Monday, are expected to close on July 10, 2021 and proceed on a one week holiday break, Education CS George Magoha has said. During the release of KSCE 2020 results on Monday at Mtihani House, Magoha said they deliberately created a tighter academic calendar that enables the ministry to accelerate the completion of school terms. "All the classes, including the 14 new Grade 5 learners and Form One Class, will start the First Term of the 2021 academic year on July 26,2021," Magoha said. He added that the upshot of this accelerated calendar will be that students will have five examinations next year. "The 2021 KCPE and KCSE will be held in March 2022. In December 2022, we will administer the 2022 KCPE and KCSE, and also the Grade Six Summative Examination for the pioneer CBC Cohort," he said. On Friday, the Education Ministry outlawed plans by a section of private schools to have learners in Grade 4 report back to school ahead of reopening. Schools reopened on Monday for third term of 2020 the last stretch in the road to recover the time lost following the shutdown of learning institutions in March 2020. Learners expected to report to their schools are those in PP1 and PP2, Grade 1 – 3, Standard 5 – 7 and Form 1 to Form 3. Some private schools had directed parents to prepare their Grade 4 learners for reopening. Magoha put those seeking such adjustment on notice saying no Grade 4 learner should report back to school.
