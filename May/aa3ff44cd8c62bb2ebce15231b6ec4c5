Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has lashed out at activist Boniface Mwangi over his remarks on the people of Kirinyaga county. In a statement on Wednesday, the governor said that the activist cannot use her name "to get funding", and he  should respect people and their families. "Do not insult the people of Kirinyaga.. they voted for development that they can now see... Respect us and our families!" Waiguru said. Her statement came hours after Mwangi in a tweet directed at the people of Kirinyaga county on Tuesday asked if the person they elected had brought them development. Waiguru went on to point out to Mwangi the award she received on Tuesday - being named the second best performing governor - by a Mizani Africa survey. "Our concept is simple, the #KirinyagaRising vision; empowering our people through improving service delivery and inclusive development. I always believe in leaving a place better than I found it," she said. In the Mizani awards, the first position was scooped by  Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki with a percentage of 79.7. Nandi Governor Stephen Sang came third with 79.0 per cent and Mombasa's Hassan Joho was fourth, with 78.9 per cent. Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o, Kiambu's James Nyoro, and Taita Taveta's Granton Samboja ranked fifth ,sixth and seventh.
