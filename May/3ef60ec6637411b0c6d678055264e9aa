Harambee Starlets' first-choiceÂ goalkeeper Annet Kundu is set to sign a short-term deal with her current team Ael Champions with the hope of a big-money move in the near future. Kundu, who is currently out of contract, said she will extend her stay at Ael upon her return to Cyprus in July adding that playing for champions Apollon FC will be a dream come true. Apollon qualified for the Champions League and 23-year-old Kundu would like to test herself in the European competition. "I am out of contract and not in a hurry at the moment to consider my future. All I know is I will return to Ael earliest July to sort my contractual situation by signing a short deal. The short contract will give me a chance to assess my options," she said. Kundu, who helped Ael to finish fourth in the league, added: "There's no better place to showcase your talent than Europe's premier competition which has always been my dream. I also habour ambitions of playing for Apollon which is a top team. The team oozes quality and experience" Kundu, formerly of Eldoret Falcons is currently doing individual training to keep fit. She said if the opportunity to play elsewhere in Europe comes by, she will jump ship as soon as possible "I attend gym sessions three times a week. I know it's not enough but it's better than seating idle," she concluded.
