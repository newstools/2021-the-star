YouTube Music on Thursday released a schedule of performances and music-industry related events in celebration of Africa month. In the lead up to its Africa Day concert, in partnership with MTV Base Africa, YouTube Music is celebrating the continent’s popular culture with performances by popular artistes from Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. Starting on Thursday, Kenyan boy-band Sauti Sol and Nigerian Afrobeats star Fireboy DML will all deliver LIVE performances of their most popular hits, which fans can enjoy via livestream on each of the artistes’ YouTube channels. In addition to performances, YouTube Music has partnered with Afro Nation, Slikour Onlife and Leading Ladies Africa to host a series of industry panel sessions focused on African Music. The virtual sessions will focus on topics; The Global Impact of Afrobeats, The Acceleration of Amapiano and Women x Music. “For more than a decade now, YouTube has helped artists develop and export the African sound to music lovers, fans and listeners worldwide while also enabling collaborations across the continent and around the world,” Manager Director, EMEA Emerging Markets Alex Okosi said. He added, "As a result, it’s only natural that the platform, where cultural movements grow and build, plays a central role in the celebration of this important month for the continent as a whole. The past ten years have shown, without a doubt, that Africa loves YouTube and YouTube has found a true home in Africa." YouTube Music’s celebrations of Africa Month will culminate in the Africa Day Concert in partnership with MTV Base Africa, and hosted, for the second year in a row, by world-renowned actor and activist Idris Elba. The concert, which will take place on May 25 at 7PM CAT on the MTV Base YouTube channel, will feature trailblazing African stars performing on multiple stages from across the continent.
