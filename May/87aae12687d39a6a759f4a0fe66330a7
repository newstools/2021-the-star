Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis on Wednesday donated 363 hybrid Galla buck goats to farmers to improve their animal breeds. “This is part of my government’s agendas to improve animal breeds in Baringo to earn farmers more money in the competitive livestock market,” Kiptis said. Kiptis spoke at Kimalel Goat Auction grounds in Baringo South. Various groups drawn from Baringo North, Tiaty, Baringo South, Mogotio and Baringo Central subcounties received the goats. The governor warned the beneficiaries against selling or slaughtering the goats, saying they are meant to serve as reproductive ‘seeds’. Farmer Joseph Barkolwo welcomed the initiative, saying goat farming has helped him put food on the table and pay his children's school fees. “We want to move away from the old goat breeds which take up to two or three years to mature and adopt modern breeds that would take no more than six months,” he said. Barkolwo urged farmers to ensure the goats are shared out evenly to reach every farmer across the county. “We expect double digits of Galla goats of about 700 by next year,” he said. Governor Kiptis said his administration is committed to supporting the value addition of the livestock sector. He said he is working to ensure the completion of the Maoi slaughterhouse and Mogotio hide and skin tannery. Present were Deputy Governor Jacob Chepkwony, Livestock executive David Koima, chief officer Winnie Bore and Lands executive Thomas ole Nongonop. Bore assured the farmers that all the goats donated have been vaccinated against diseases. Edited by A.N
