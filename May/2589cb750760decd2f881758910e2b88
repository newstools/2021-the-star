Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli has condemned those behind the vandalisation of a road named after him along Kileleshwa, Nairobi. Atwoli via Twitter on Sunday said vandalisation is impunity and primitiveness. “In a country that believes in the rule of Law there are procedures and processes to be followed when unsatisfied,” he said. “ I am against anarchy. However, the police will look into that.” Two days ago, Atwoli rubbished claims that the signpost of a road named after him was removed. In a statement on Friday, the Cotu boss said people should stop wasting time celebrating fake news. "Nothing was removed to make you happy, don’t waste your time celebrating fake news! God’s wish is Paramount," Atwoli said. A picture of the signpost on a lorry circulated on social media fuelling speculations that it had been vandalized. The Nairobi County Government named a road after Atwoli, in a ceremony led by the acting governor, Ann Kananu alongside other county officials. The road in Kileleshwa, near Kenya High School, was formerly called Dik Dik Road. In June 2017, the National Addressing System Strategy Development and Implementation Committee proposed new rules prohibiting the use of names of living persons. The rules abolished any changes to existing street names. The proposed guidelines said the Cabinet Secretary for information and communications through the Communications Authority of Kenya, would have oversight responsibility regarding the national policy and standards on street-naming and property numbering.
