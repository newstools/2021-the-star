Directorate of Criminal Investigation duo of Carolyne Sirengo and Josephine Wafula have been challenged to live up to their dreams of donning the Malkia Strikers jersey despite being dropped from the squad. The duo were part of Paul Bitok's 20-strong provisional squad that has been in a bubble training camp for more than one and a half months at the Kasarani Indoor Arena. The Kenyan queens are putting on final touches to their preparations ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in July. Sirengo (middle blocker) and  Wafula (libero) were axed alongside Prisons' experienced Joan Chelagat and KCB's Jemimah Siang'u as the management trimmed the squad for a trip to Brazil before it was cancelled last week. "It was tough for them but looking at the squad, it is full of quality. The national team coaches spoke to me before making the decision and I accepted their verdict," said DCI coach Daniel Bor. The national team management said the decision to drop the quartet was 'tough'. Bor has, however, urged Sirengo and Wafula to put aside their disappointment and focus on improving their weaknesses for future consideration. "Being called up to train with senior players was a good experience for them. This is not time to dwell on their setback since they still have time to prove a point and rightfully earn their slots in future," said Bor. "Giving up is not an option. They need to work extra hard. They are still young  but competitive and I trust them to be decisive for us when the league resumes." Among the areas earmarked for improvement include reception, back court defending and ball retrieval.
