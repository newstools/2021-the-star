Fletna Kenya has signed actor and model Khula Budi as its new Beauty Brand Ambassador. Fletna Kenya is an e-commerce website that sells nature-rich products. The former Mr World Kenya, who is also a fitness model and male grooming enthusiast, will be featured in a new integrated campaign for the men's line, Tea Tree products, from June 2021. Khula's product will also be among those featured on the website. Carolyne, Fletna Global CEO and co-founder, said Khula Budi is strong, passionate about what he does. Speaking about the partnership, Khula said, "It's amazing to partner with a skincare line that, for the very first time, thinks about men. I have been getting secret conversations and DMs on how I take care of my skin." Adding, "Men don't have to shy away from taking care of their skin anymore. Wash that face, moisturise, tone it, cleanse it and feel better." Aleksander Krensic, co-founder, Fletna Global, said, "We are always happy to work with entrepreneurs like ourselves to help both brands grow. We are also super-excited to be expanding Fletna's offering for men." Khula was the Mr World Kenya 2018 and emerged second in Africa after losing to South Africaâ€™s Fezile Mkhize, the 2019 Mr World Africa.
