Garissa leaders have appealed to the two governments, donors and well-wishers to help mitigate the effects of drought, especially lack of water in the county. Speaking on their behalf in Garissa town on Sunday, Modogashe MCA Ali Gure said the situation is dire and thousands of people need relief assistance. He said schools and hospitals in the Lagdera sub county could be shut down due to lack of water and the worsening drought. “Our people are suffering. We have been relying on water trucks to supply water to the residents but they are not enough to serve thousands of residents who are now in dire need,” Gure said. “I want to call on the two governments and well-wishers to help us with more water supplies.” Gure alleged that the recent border clashes between Garissa and Isiolo may have been fueled by lack of enough water and pastures for their animals. “The security challenges in Lagdera and Isiolo borders are adding pain to the people,” the MCA said. “People are fighting for the few water wells in the area. These problems may escalate if we do not move fast to address the water shortage.” On Sunday, Garissa Governor Ali Korane said the area had experienced low rainfall leading to a shortage of water and pastures for their livestock. The National Drought and Management Authority has already issued an alert over the deterioration in livestock body condition and milk production. In its January report, the authority said that storage and water sources are depleting by the day due to the failed October-December rainfall. Like the neighbouring counties in North Eastern, Garissa did not receive adequate rainfall during the last October – November short rain season. As a result, most of the earth pans did not collect water, and most grazing lands did not grow any pasture.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
