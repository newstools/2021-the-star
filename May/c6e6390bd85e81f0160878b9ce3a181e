Heavy rains will continue to soak most of the country this weekend, the Meteorological  department has said. Kenyans have been advised to be on the lookout for possible floods and landslides. In a statement on Saturday evening, Met director Stella Aura said the downpour will mostly be at night and in the afternoon of both Saturday and Sunday. Aura said residents of Central, Nairobi and parts of Eastern Regions should expect showers and thunderstorm on Saturday night. She said most counties will experience some sunny intervals on Sunday. She said the rains will intensify in Western, Nyanza, Central and South Rift Valley regions which will have rains from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon. The government has asked Kenyans to be extra cautious while on road. Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna said in a Tweet, "Met says it’s going to rain heavy tonight. Everyone using the roads either as a driver or pedestrian is advised to observe extra caution. Avoid passing through moving waters." Heavy rains are currently being experienced across the country. Last week, a home and a farm were destroyed by a landslide in Wanjerere area of Murang’a county. Murugu Mboko, the owner, said he noticed cracks developing in his farm two weeks ago and reported the matter to the local administrators. Springs of water flowed from the cracks. Murugu was advised to relocate. And two days after he left his home for safe grounds, his house and part of his farm were destroyed by a landslide.
