Comedian and divorcee Muthee Kiengei says the end of a marriage is unfortunate but not enlightening. Kiengei was married to media personality Keziah wa Kariuki but they divorced a few years ago. In a Facebook post, the father of two asked people to always pray for their marriage. He was responding to the publicised divorce between Bill Gates and his wife of 27 years Melinda Gates. Kiengei wrote, "Either rich or poor, divorce has nothing to learn about. It's the unfortunate thing that happens between a happy vow that later turns sour," he said. "A lot happening in their [Gates'] lives, more than we can read, and remember we are reading what they wrote. Being a victim of their situation, I will only say this... If you are married, always pray for your marriage."
