Several workers were on Thursday evening trapped after the new multimillion-shilling Nyamira county assembly -which is under construction - collapsed. Residents and traders are in the process of evacuating the construction workers. Police officers had a hard time trying to get residents away from the building. Three of the workers have been evacuated and rushed to Nyamira County Referral Hospital. According to the residents who were at first responders to the scene, construction was ongoing at the time the building collapsed. Two floors of the five-storey building were complete and the the third floor was in its final stages. A total of Sh367 million had been allocated for the building. The number of workers trapped in the building is still unclear. Red cross officials, traders and residents are currently trying to evacuate the workers. So far seven construction workers have been safely evacuated. According to Dr Silas Ayunga who is the County director of medical services, the seven people are in stable condition. "We have admitted them and they are in stable condition. We are also optimistic that they will be ok with time," he said.
