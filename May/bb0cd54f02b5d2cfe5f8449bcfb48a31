Over 3.8 million Huduma Namba cards are currently being distributed countrywide, the government has said. In an update published by the Interior Ministry on Friday, the government urged Kenyans to pick their cards whenever summoned to. "Once the card is produced, a text message is sent to the number used during the registration period," the Ministry said. "The message prompts the owner to select the preferred collection centre, after which another notification is sent when the card is delivered and ready for collection." In April, the government said that only 10 per cent of released Huduma Namba cards were collected. Government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said out of about two million released cards, only 200,000 had been collected by April 1 since the roll out of mass distribution on February 2. According to him, most Kenyans delay in choosing the location where the card should be sent despite getting messages on their mobile phones. "The options are actually in a link. You click the link and you will be given options. So you choose an area that is convenient to you," Oguna said. Oguna said Kenyans have three days to respond to messages calling them to collect their cards after which the message link will disappear. "When the message disappears and your card is ready, we go back to records, find out where you registered and send the card to a bureau near where you registered," he said.
