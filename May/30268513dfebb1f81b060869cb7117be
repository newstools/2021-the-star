Crowne Plaza Nairobi Airport has defied Covid-19 shock that hit the sector to be named among top 10 hotel destinations in the world. The ranking emanated from customers’ reviews. The Hotel earned great traveler reviews on Tripadvisor over the last 12 months. According to Tripadvisor’s chief commercial officer Kanika Soni, Choice Awards highlight the places that are consistently excellent - delivering quality experiences time and time again even while navigating changing customer expectations and new ways of working. Based on a full year of reviews from customers, this award speaks to the great service and experience hotels provided guests in the midst of a pandemic. Congratulations to all the winners,’’ Soni said. “Although the past year has been characterized by uncertainty, especially for the tourism industry, we were able to adopt to the challenges by implementing an IHG Clean Promise and utilizing technology to prioritize our guests' safety,’’ the hotel’s general manager Barnabas Wamoto said.
