Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has called for calm, as the government tries to find ways of getting more Covid-19 vaccines. In a statement on Thursday, the CS said that those who took the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be worried about missing out on the second shot because the vaccine offers up to 70 per cent protection. "We have not heard from anywhere of people dying because they did not get the second dose," Kagwe said. He went on to assure Kenyans that all who have been vaccinated will get their second dose. Kagwe noted that AstraZeneca is least likely to remain the vaccine of choice in Africa due to the delays that are being experienced, as he also highlighted the measures that the government has put in place. "The government is holding discussions with other manufacturers of vaccines like the Johnson and Johnson among others." "Our other measure is to take back doses from Counties where uptake has been low and redistribute them to Counties where the demand was high," he added. CS Kagwe emphasised the need for African countries to have the capacity to manufacture their own vaccines, insisting that the continent must stop relying on aid from developed countries. This comes a few days after Health Director-General, Patrick Amoth in a statement said that the administration of the second dose of the covid-19 vaccines will be done in 12 weeks. The initial expected time was between eight to ten weeks. The Ministry of Health had earlier issued a new directive, saying that the exercise will begin early June.
