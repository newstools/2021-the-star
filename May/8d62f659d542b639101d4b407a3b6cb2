The polio vaccination campaign that started in 13 high risk counties will be conducted in strict adherence to the Covid-19 containment measures. The Health ministry says unlike in previous exercises, where vaccinators would open the mouth of the child, it is the mothers and guardians who will be required to do so. The vaccinators will then drop the vaccine in the mouth. Similarly, the vaccinators and the mothers will be required to be properly masked by covering the mouth and nose at all times to avoid endangering the lives of the children during the vaccination. “Our social mobilisation and vaccination teams will be observing strict safety measures, including reducing physical contact during the polio vaccination drive. We cannot afford to endanger the lives of the children as we vaccinate them against polio,” head of Public Health Dr Francis Kuria said. “In this campaign, those fears should not hinder us from getting the child vaccinated. We are urging that parents and guardians are this time round asked to open the mouth of the children so the vaccinator will only drop the vaccine in the mouth,” he added. The ministry has called on parents, guardians, communities, religious leaders, community elders and all those living in the areas where the campaign is taking place to ensure that all children aged below five years receive the  vaccine. The exercise targets 13 counties and a population of more than 3.4 million children below five years in the respective counties. The counties are Garissa, Mandera, Isiolo, Wajir, Kitui, Tana River, Lamu, Machakos, Kiambu, Kilifi, Kajiado, Nairobi and Mombasa. The exercise targets 249,391 children in Garissa, 255,885 in Mandera, 51,206 in Isiolo, 180,714 in Wajir, 175,425 in Kitui, 85,020 in Tana River, 25,104 in Lamu, 233,770 in Machakos, 330,465 in Kiambu, 327,338 in Kilifi, 234,197 in Kajiado, 965,243 in Nairobi and 323,620 children in Mombasa. According to Health CS Mutahi Kagwe, though Africa was declared polio free in August last year, there have been reported outbreaks in 21 countries within the region, including Kenya. “Kenya’s case success in the eradication of polio is undermined by neighbors who have continued to report outbreaks leaving our country at high risk of polio transmission. Data from the ministry shows that a polio outbreak in Garissa county in 2013 led to two deaths and left 14 people paralyzed. The ongoing phase one drive will end on Wednesday with the second round of the vaccination expected to start from June 19 to 23.
