The matatu industry has been one of the most affected by government measures to mitigate the rate of coronavirus infections. One of the strategies suggested in the public transport sector has been cashless transactions to reduce transmission through exchange of paper money. However, many matatu operators are yet to embrace these technologies, such as M-pesa, forcing many commuters to provide cash instead. Certain matatus even have a clear, written notice informing passengers they do not accept M-pesa transactions. So why are many operators apprehensive about a cashless technology, which connects billions of users worldwide? One of the reasons is the cunningness associated with Nairobi. M-pesa allows money senders to reverse a wrong transaction by calling the customer care and providing details of the same. The possibility of unscrupulous passengers pulling this stunt puts off many operators from this technology. Also, many Kenyans are riddled with debt from Fuliza and are unable to receive money in their accounts for fear of the same being used to repay their debt. Among these millions of Fuliza debtors are matatu operators, who may not be able to withdraw cashless transactions should the money received be swallowed up by Fuliza. The slow uptake of M-pesa in the public transport sector is symptomatic of the challenges of change implementation. Barriers to change implementation often result from lack of understanding about the benefits of change and perceived negative impacts of the same. Maybe it is time for stakeholders to collaborate on an elaborate awareness campaign to convince naysayers that technology is meant for their benefit and not detriment.
