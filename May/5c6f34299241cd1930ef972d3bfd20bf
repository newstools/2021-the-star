Infrastructure projects will get the hugest chunk of next financial year’s budget in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s race against time to seal his legacy. The National Treasury has proposed Sh353 billion to various ventures in the roads, transport, energy, ICT, housing and public works sectors. Other big spenders will be education Sh202 billion, Sh183 billion for national security agencies, and Health Sh106 billion. Agriculture and food security will account for Sh40.6 billion; Sh93 billion for the environment, water, and natural resources sector, and Sh37.8 billion for social protection.
