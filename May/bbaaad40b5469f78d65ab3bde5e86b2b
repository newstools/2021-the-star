A postmortem on Tuesday revealed that a 15-year-old girl died after her parents beat her, triggering an asthma attack. Police said they plan to charge the parents and the victim's elder brother with manslaughter in the death of Christine Makena. She had run away from home and not gone to school. A postmortem indicated the cause of death was soft tissue injuries, a chest infection and a suspected asthma attack. She had a history of asthma. The autopsy  was carried out at the Coptic Hospital in Nairobi by government pathologist Dr Dorothy Njeru. Her father Frankline Ntwiga Marangu, her mother Benedetta Mbeni Muthoka and elder brother Ian Marangu were produced in court on Monday. Police were allowed to hold them for three days while they investigate. They are expected in court on Thursday, May 27, when they are likely be charged with manslaughter and take a plea, officials aware of the probe said.
