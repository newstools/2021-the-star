A  man who was beaten by a mob in Limuru over suspicion of defiling a student will remain in custody until May 17 when he will take plea. Peter Mbiriri Njoroge, 34, was arraigned on Wednesday but did not take plea after he told the court that he was feeling unwell. Njoroge had bandages on his head, arm and his right hand index finger. He told Limuru chief magistrate Evelyne Olwande that he needed time to complete his medication and recover following the beating by a mob on Tuesday. The magistrate accepted the request and directed the accused to be locked up at Tigoni police station pending plea taking on May 17. Njoroge was attacked by a mob after a secondary school girl he had offered a lift in his car raised alarm claiming he had sexually assaulted her. It was reported that the accused had offered the Form 3 student a lift from Kabuku  to Limuru town, but he diverted and went to a tea plantation. Limuru subcounty police commander Eilen Mola on Wednesday said the suspect drove his car to Mabrokie tea plantation where he threatened to inject the student with poison if she screamed or turned down his sexual advances. The accused is then said to have defiled the girl. “The student was scared because she had been threatened with being poisoned,” the police boss said. Mola said after the assault, the student bravely threw the syringe outside the car, and started struggling with the suspect. She managed to grab the ignition keys and threw them in the tea plantation. “The vehicle went off and the girl started screaming for help while the man beat her. Tea pickers who heard the screams came to her rescue and beat the suspect,” she added. Police arrived shortly and rescued the suspect. They took both the victim and the suspect to Limuru hospital where the student was treated and discharged while the suspect was taken to Tigoni police station.  -Edited by SKanyara
