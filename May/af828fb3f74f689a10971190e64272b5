National champions Ulinzi Warriors have their eyes set on retaining their crown and leaving a mark in the Basketball Africa League (BAL). Coach William Balozi said they have been training daily, though individually, to help them remain fit, focused and all ready to go whenever called upon. "The boys are running daily and doing individual exercise to keep fit. They are just waiting for the announcement to commence action," Balozi said. Apart from the league, Ulinzi also remain focused on the continent's newest event — the BAL. "Apart from focusing on retaining our crown, we also want to leave a mark in the BAL. We are not going there just to add up the numbers but to compete," he added. "This is a tough tournament that has some of the continent's top clubs and we must be adequately prepared if we are to leave a mark." He said the soldiers, who have already lost one league tie — away to Kisumu Lakeside — will go out to show their true colours. Warriors recently elevated national team guard Eric Mutoro to team captain, assisted by his back court mate Tiberius Menya. The inaugural BAL show, which was postponed from last year due to Covid-19, tips off this Sunday in Kigali, Rwanda with a total of 12 teams. Home team Patriots handled by Kenyan tactician Ben Oluoch will take on Hoopers Rivers of Nigeria in the much-awaited opener. The show parades national champions from Angola, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal and Tunisia who got straight tickets to the finals tour. The other six teams — from Algeria, Cameroon, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique and hosts Rwanda — secured their tickets by qualifying in the elimination rounds in Kigali in November 2019. Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) were the country's representative in the event but they were eliminated despite not losing a game. The porters arrived late for the tournament and missed their opener against Uganda's City Oilers, who got a walk over.
