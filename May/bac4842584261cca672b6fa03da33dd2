The Covid-19 pandemic has been blamed for the delayed completion of the Sh599 million Mokowe customs jetty in Lamu. The project being undertaken by the national government since 2019 was supposed to have been completed by December last year before it was pushed to February this year. However, four months on, there is no sign that the jetty will be completed any time soon. The Mokowe Jetty is the largest in the region and is the only pickup and drop off point for people and cargo coming and leaving Lamu island. Chief structural engineer in the State Department of Public Works Hillary Nyaanga however said the works are 65 per cent complete. He gave a new date and said the jetty would be ready by August. “The pandemic has disrupted our schedules for completion for quite some time but we hope that by August the jetty will ready, ” Nyaanga said. Apart from the Mokowe jetty, the government has so far undertaken and completed construction of three other key jetties in the region that had been structurally unsound for years. They are the Mtangawanda Jetty which cost Sh72 million, the Sh48 million Manda Airport Jetty and the Sh35 million Lamu Mangrove Terminal Jetty. This year, the government announced plans to construct a new jetty at the Lamu King Fahad County Hospital to aid the movement of personnel and patients coming in and out of the facility. Jetties are a crucial element of Lamu’s water transport system as they are the main entry and exit points for passengers and cargo coming to Lamu Town and adjacent islands. The Mokowe Customs Jetty, for instance, has been given a modern face and includes a large waiting bay and a mini-petrol station. It also includes specially designed ramps to accommodate physically challenged people.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
