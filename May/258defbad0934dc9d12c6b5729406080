Kibera Soccer Ladies coach Ramadhan Vijago wants the four players set for trials in the United States of America to improve their overall performance in order to quickly adapt to the American system of play. Captain Lilian Mmboga (midfielder), Lona Nyabuto (midfielder), Laventine Lihemo (striker) and defender Pauline Akinyi are set for trials in the US at the end of the season. The Kenya Women's Premier League is expected to resume before the month ends and Vijago has challenged the athletes to channel their energies in enhancing their basics to stand a chance of impressing while overseas. He said they should hit peak condition and maximise on the opportunity presented by their partners. "Opportunity comes once and they should grab it. The team will be back on the field soon and I expect them to set the ball rolling upon resumption. They have to get their basics right and hard work is the only way. Time is not on their side and they should get their act together sooner," he said. "They will have to adjust to a new environment, which becomes hard at times," said Vijago, who has guided the slum team to sixth position in the eight-team Zone 'A' league. Kibera have registered only two wins in 10 matches coupled with three draws and five losses where they are closer to the drop than the playoffs. Four matches were remaining for the regular season to end before the league was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. The top teams for both Zone 'A' and 'B' will advance to the playoffs.
