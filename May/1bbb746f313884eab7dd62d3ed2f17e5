Spain-based Kenyan star Mercy Wanyama wants the Kenya Lionesses team-mates to intensify individual training and fitness ahead of the  FIBA Africa Afro-Basket Zone Five qualifiers. She said this will ensure they do not spend too much time on conditioning ahead of the FIBA Africa Afro-Basket Zone Five qualifiers scheduled for Cairo, Egypt from July 5-10. The Cortegada centre, who is currently in the country, said she is all set to hit the ground running as soon as the government gives the team greenlight to assemble. Kenya Basketball Federation last month unveiled a 25-man squad to prepare for the Zone 5 qualifiers as they await government’s go ahead to start training. Wanyama welcomed the young talents named to the team, saying all they need to do is work hard and learn from their seniors counterparts. “The main difference is the stage and level of competition which they will overcome through guidance and mentor-ship in training camp,” she pointed out. “They should also come mentally prepared to carry the expectations and dreams of over 45 million Kenyans.” She, however, warned that the competition has grown over the years and they will have to be at their best. Mercy, the younger sibling of football stars McDonald Mariga and Victor Wanyama, was one of the shining light in the 2019 Africa women’s Championships in Dakar, Senegal. She was the third best rebounder in the tournament as well as team’s top scorer alongside and captain Hilda Indasi. Other diaspora players Kenya is banking on are USA-based Felmas Koranga, Olivia-Nelson Ododa, Clara Rotich, Victoria Wanjara, Brenda Adhiambo, Rose Ouma (UAE) and Purity Auma (Bangladesh).
