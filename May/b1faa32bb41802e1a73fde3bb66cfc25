According to the recent worrying trends of enforced disappearance, torture, bludgeoning and killing of people suspected of anything, Kenya has become one large crime scene that should be cordoned off and investigated. Administration of criminal justice has deteriorated to the point that we only need to point at you and say you are a criminal and the next day, we'll abduct you, torture you, kill and dump your body in some remote thicket. Things are worse than the pre-Philip Ransley time in 2009 when police would target over 500 youths from a particular region and execute them. It is worse now. In fact, the enforced disappearances and murders are no longer done using bullets because they have noted we are catching up. It has become easier to trace the bullets back to the person who pulled the trigger. They are now using bare hands to strangle the victims. The main suspect in this case are only twoâ€”the police and organised criminal gangs. I don't see any other. There is need to establish an independent judicial inquest to investigate these two suspects before everything degenerates further. The independent probe can be instigated by IPOA and supervised by the Judiciary. Or the Judiciary can move on its own motion. This is not a remote possibility. These independent investigations should be thorough to bring these powerful suspects to book in the interest of the rule of law. The situation also calls for the establishment of the Coroner's service to investigate cases of torture as provided for by the law. It is important to underscore that the said law is yet to be operationalised, despite having been passed by Parliament and enacted into law by the President in 2013. Either way, we must find sustainable ways to bring the police and/ or any other perpetrators of these crimes to justice in line with the law.
