The Laikipia government has recorded a steady growth of locally sourced revenue despite Covid-19 pandemic having affected the country's economy. Between July 2020 and April 2021, the county collected Sh676 million compared to Sh542 million recorded between July 2019 and April 2020. This is a Sh133 million increment, representing a 24.5 per cent increase. Between July 2018 and April 2019, the devolved unit had the best revenue collection of Sh664 million In comparison to the current financial year, this records an increase of Sh11 million representing a two per cent increase. Speaking after the swearing-in of Laikipia County Revenue Board chairperson Alice Kimemia, Governor Ndiritu Muriithi attributed the growth to resilience and commitment by residents. "The reason residents are committed to pay their taxes is because they can see tangible change happening to our infrastructure in our towns and rural access roads," Muriithi said. "We thank the people of Laikipia for their commitment to their development. We are on track on achieving our annual revenue target of Sh1 billion." Through the ambitious smart town initiative, the administration intends to upgrade 10 trading centres with proper roads, green spaces, drainage and street lighting. Kimemia took over the board's leadership from Wangari Wachira who was recently appointed to the Agriculture Executive post. In his recent reconstitution of his Cabinet, Muriithi appointed Wachira to replace Lucy Murugi who has been on sick leave. She was appointed as senior advisor to the governor. The county boss had earlier nominated Wachira to replace ousted Education CEC Tabitha Mbiriri but a Nyeri court restrained her vetting by the County Assembly. After a performance appraisal exercise in September last year, Muriithi relieved Mbiriri of her duties together with the Chief Officer Annette Muriuki after the department allegedly posted poor results. -Edited by SKanyara
