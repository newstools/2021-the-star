A man from Marsabit county is on a mission to traverse 25 counties on a bicycle to create awareness of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. Fredrick Ochieng', 25, has begun a second phase of his anti-coronavirus campaign and seeks to cycle from Tana River to Turkana through 23 other counties. These include Kilifi, Mombasa, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Makueni, Kitui, Machakos, Kajiado, Narok, Bomet, Nyamira, Kisii, Migori, Homa Bay, Vihiga, Kakamega, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot. In August last year, Ochieng cycled through 14 counties from Moyale near the Kenya-Ethiopia border to Busia near the Kenya-Uganda border in 20 days as the country bore the brunt of the pandemic. Speaking to journalists in Kitui Town on Friday, he said he began the journey on May 10 and expects to complete it by July 16. Ochieng said his initiative had been inspired by widespread failure by Kenyans to observe the guidelines laid out by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization to combat the pandemic. “Most Kenyans still think Covid-19 is a hoax and have failed to support measures by the government to fight Covid-19. They no longer wear masks nor wash hands or maintain social distancing which is key in preventing the spread of the deadly disease,” he said. Ochieng said that he would not tire to remind Kenyans about the deadly disease and ways to curb its spread across the country. He said he was forced to leave his wife and two children behind to take up the mission. “Lack of funds to cater for my upkeep and accommodation along the way has also been a major challenge but I thank Kenyans of goodwill for their support so far,” he added before proceeding to Machakos county.
