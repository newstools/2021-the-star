Brian Kanyori Wangui, a Form 2 student, has been spending time with his grandmother in Kikuyu area of Kiambu during the ending school break. On April 15, he was sent to buy chicken feeds from a local shop in Kikuyu but took longer than usual. When confronted, he took off from home. For over two weeks now, he is not home and his family is worried. Every effort to trace him only adds to their frustration. A search for him at the homes of the familyâ€™s relatives have not borne any fruit. The family is frustrated and stressed. "We have tried our best to look for him. It is very sad for me not to know where my son is for over two weeks now. All efforts to trace him have not helped," his mother Susan Wangui said, sobbing. "I have asked his classmates and friends in the area but no one has seen him," Wangui told the Star. She said that her firstborn son was asked why he took two hours to be back home from the shop in a place that takes 30 minutes on a round trip. He walked away without giving any explanation. The family lives in Nderi area of Sigona Ward, Kikuyu constituency, Kiambu. Brian was wearing black sweat pants, a navy blue jumper and open black shoes. He is a student at Githiga Boys High school. The mother of two said Brian has never run from home before, no matter what mistake he did or the scolding he got. Wangui said they reported to police two days later on April 18. The report was recorded at Kikuyu police station under OB number 36/18/4/2021. The family can be reached through the following contact should the boy be spotted anywhere.
