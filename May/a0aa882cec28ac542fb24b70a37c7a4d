The late veteran Afro-fusion singer Achieng Abura's son Prince is dead. Prince was diagnosed with sickle-cell anaemia soon after his birth. His death was announced through an M-Changa message posted on Facebook. "Today I announce with a humble heart the passing on to glory of Prince Abura in his sleep. I just want to thank all who supported this worthy course. He was to graduate at Riara University in September," it read. "May God remember you in your time of need. More updates soon as we close this fundraiser. To donate securely to the Prince Abura Sickle Cell Fund, a treasurer-controlled fundraiser, M-Pesa: Paybill No. 891300 Account No. Abura." In October 2016, after Achieng’s death, Prince had some complications that resulted in him being admitted to Aga Khan Hospital. Kenyans donated millions of shillings in an online campaign that aimed to raise the Sh4 million required for his treatment. However, reports said hospitals in the UK did not admit Prince because he wasn’t covered by National Health Services. "Unfortunately, it seems they will not admit Prince unless he is covered by the NHS, which could only happen if Prince was enrolled in a college there. The cost of seeking sickle-cell treatment without this coverage is beyond us," the fundraiser chairperson said then. "We immediately set about looking for alternatives and have been in touch with the Indian High Commission to see if they have any leads that can assist us to pursue treatment in India."
