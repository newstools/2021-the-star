The Political Parties dispute Tribunal PPDT on Monday dismissed an application by Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala who sought to set aside his removal as Deputy Minority Leader. In his Complaint before the Tribunal, Senator Malala had sought for conservatory Orders injuncting his removal as the deputy Minority Leader. In dismissing the Complaint, the PPDT upheld a preliminary objection filed by the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) . Through its lawyer Samuel Makori, the Party argued successfully that the Senator had failed to invoke the set down procedures for Internal Dispute Resolution Mechanism that was provided for. This means the decision by NASA Senators on March 24, 2021 wherein they had nominated Senator Stewart Madzayo as the Deputy Minority Leader now stands. In April, PPDT handed Malala a reprieve in staying the decision by NASA senators to dethrone him as Senate deputy Minority leader seat. He told the court that his removal was unprocedural, unilateral, unlawful and violated the NASA coalition agreement between ODM and four political parties, hence null and void. NASA senators on March 24 replaced Malala with Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo of ODM at the height of the upheavals among the coalition’s partners. The Kakamega Senator’s troubles intensified after he supported the ANC candidate in the Matungu MP by-election. He sued ODM with Madzayo, ANC, and Wiper, Chama cha Mashinani, Office of Registar of Political Parties, and Ford K.
