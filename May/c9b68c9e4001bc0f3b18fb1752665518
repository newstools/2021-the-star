Ex-lovers Bongo star Diamond and his baby mama Zari have gone viral after being pictured wearing wedding-themed clothes as they were surrounded by cameras, probably for a music video they are shooting. After the event, Diamond shared a video at Zari’s mansion. Later on, he spent time with his kids, having bought them Range Rover toy cars. Back home his other baby mamas Tanasha and Hamisa Mobetto celebrated each other on Mother’s Day. Tanasha wrote, "Happy Mother’s Day to you, Mama Dylan." Hamisa responded, "Thank You Mama NJ." Diamond is in South Africa recording his second album. He has been insisting he is single while Zari, on the other hand, has been flaunting a man, ‘Dark Stallion’, who is reported to be her current boo.
