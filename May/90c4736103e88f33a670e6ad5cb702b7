Former Kelele Takatifu member Moji Short Baba over the weekend walked down the aisle with the love of his life Nyawira Gachugi in a secluded event at Sovereign Suites. Moji had recently held a traditional wedding with only a few people invited. Speaking to Word Is, Moji said he decided to put his life private away from his career. "Kazi yangu ni kuimba but away from that, I am a private person. If I made it public, people would have blamed me for not inviting them," he said. "I met my wife in church three years ago and it has been an amazing journey walking towards this direction." He added that he would have wished to invite most of his close friends but due to the coronavirus pandemic restrictions, he was only able to invite a few of them. The two shared pictures of their wedding on Monday, making it public that they are officially husband and wife. The singer added that he is happy to have found the love of his life, and he can't wait to see what God has in store for their life going forward. "Been waiting to use this verse for a long time. 'He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favour from the Lord. Proverbs 18:22' @nyawiragachugi, I am glad I found you! And I can't wait to see what God has in store for us!" NyawiraÂ  also took to Instagram to say she has officially become a Mrs and she is happy that her forever has begun. "1.05.2021. The girl became a Mrs. Forever began." Moji is set to release an EP later this month.
