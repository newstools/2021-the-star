The Ameru community in Garissa Monday held a demonstration to protest against the killing of their tribesman allegedly by a senior officer. The demonstrators barricaded the road leading to the Garissa police station before they were dispersed by officers. Transport along the Garissa – Nairobi highway was briefly disrupted, with business closing for fear of goons looting their shops as the police engaged the demonstrators in running battles. Speaking to journalists outside the Garissa police station, the Ameru association chairperson David Mutea said they were not satisfied with how the police were handling the matter. They called for speedy investigations into the killing of Denis Kimathi, a carpenter. “Our people came to record a statement yesterday but they were denied access to the station,” Mutea said. “We want the police to move with speed and investigate this matter so that we can have justice for the family of the deceased.” Mutea said that the police were dragging the matter to cover one of their own. Witnesses said an alteration ensued between the officer and the man over a woman in a bar on Sunday at 3 a.m. The officer, allegedly overpowered during a scuffle, drew his pistol and shot Kimathi in the hip. The man tried to run for his life but collapsed 200 metres from the scene because of excessive bleeding. His body was taken to the Garissa Referral Hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem. Garissa county criminal investigations officer Noah Katumo said that a probe into the matter have already begun. “The cartridges have been sent to Nairobi for forensic examinations. We have taken statements from three eyewitnesses and we are progressing well in the investigation,”  Katumo said. The DCIO boss urged the residents to be calm as they continue with the investigations. Investigators will get to the bottom of the incident and whoever will be found culpable will face the full force of the law, he said.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
