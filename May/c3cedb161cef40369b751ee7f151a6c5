The High Court in Meru has referred the petition that sought nullification of the impeachment of Wajir Governor Abdi Mohammed to Chief Justice Martha Koome, for the formation of a three-judge bench for determination. Justice Patrick Jeremy Otieno on Monday said he was in agreement with the petitioners that there were court orders which took effect when Mohammed was removed from office. "It is hereby directed that the matter be heard by more than one judge and it shall henceforth be dealt with after the Chief Justice exercises mandate under articles 165(4) of the Constitution", the orders read. The judge also directed that court orders issued on May 18, 2021, remain in force. On May 18, the court stopped the replacement of Mohamed Abdi Mohamud as Wajir Governor despite his impeachment by the Senate. Justice Otieno also stopped the swearing-in of Wajir Deputy Governor Ahmed Mukhtar as the new county boss until a case filed by five county residents is heard and determined. The judge further suspended implementation of the Kenya Gazette notice of May 17, which announced the Senate's resolution to remove the governor on abuse of office charges. Justice Otieno certified the application filed by Aden Ibrahim, Omar Jele, Bishar Ahmed, Safiya Mahammed and Yussuf Ibrahim as urgent. Through their lawyers, the applicants wanted the Senateâ€™s resolution nullified as it was conducted while there was a court order stopping it. They argued that the High Court issued orders on April 29, stopping the Senate from discussing the resolution by the County Assembly of Wajir to impeach Abdi.
