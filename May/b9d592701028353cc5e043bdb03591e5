Mitangani residents in Bamba division are living in fear of attacks by elephants from the Tsavo East National park. The elephants have marauded their homesteads and farms in search of pasture, hence affected learning in some schools as pupils have been forced to report to school late and leave early over safety concerns. Franklin Kalume, a teacher at Midoina Primary School, said as a precautionary measure, they have advised their pupils not to go to school early because the elephants move when it's dark. “The elephants are all over Bamba and some parts of Vitengeni division,” he said. Kalume said they had to take the initiative after a group of pupils bumped on a herd of elephants on their way to school. “Some of the pupils returned home while one came to school. The tension is high in this area,” he said Other schools that have been affected include Mitsedzini, Kavunzoni, Jira and Mnago wa Dola primary schools. Robert Gona from Nzovuni said the elephants have also crossed to the area. Chengo said farmers can no longer attend to their farms due to the fear of being attacked. “They have been spotted several times. The Kenya Wildlife services officers patrol the area whenever we send them messages but they have not been able to send them away,” he said A KWS officer said the elephants have crossed to the area in search of pasture. “It is very dry in the parks that’s why the animals have crossed to this area. They are relatively calm and have not harmed anyone,” the officer said. “People will have to live with them for the time being. Even if we drive them away now they will come back.” He advised residents to stop shouting or attempting to drive the beasts away when they see them. A large area of the western side of the Bamba division lies in the buffer zone of the Tsavo East national park. The area is prone to human-wildlife conflicts.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
