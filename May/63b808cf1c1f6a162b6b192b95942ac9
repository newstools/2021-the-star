*2:52pm: Updates Senate Speaker communication to the House Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka on Tuesday declared the seat held by nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura vacant. This is following a decision by Jubilee Party to expel him after he was accused of campaigning for a candidate of a different political outfit. "...the seat of the Member of the Senate elected under Article 98 (1) (d)of the Constitution and held by Hon. Isaac Mwaura Maigua became vacant, with effect from the 7th May, 2021," Lusaka said in a gazette dated May 10th , 2021. Lusaka officially communicated to the House a vacancy following Mwaura's expulsion. He said he gazetted the vacancy after thorough consultation and receipt of various items as provided for in the Constitution. Mwaura had suffered a major setback after the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal endorsed a decision by the Jubilee Party to expel him on the grounds of disloyalty and pledging allegiance to another outfit. In March, Mwaura got a reprieve after the High Court in Nairobi slammed brakes on his expulsion from the Jubilee Party. Justice Hedwig Ong'udi  temporarily suspended the decision by the ruling  party to expel Mwaura pending hearing of his case. Meanwhile, Lusaka said the revocation of Mwaura's nomination and his participation in the House during the morning session on Tuesday when he voted in favour of the BBI Bill does not invalidate proceedings of the House.
