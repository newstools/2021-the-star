Mugithi singer Mary Gioche, alias Kareh B, says she learnt the Kikuyu language by listening to radio and attending church services. Speaking to Word Is, Kareh B said high school was hell as her schoolmates would gossip about her and she could not understand. "After joining Kikuyu theatre later, people also laughed at my mispronunciations and it was a challenge for me." She said her determination to learn bore fruits. "I was determined to learn, I started listening to vernacular radio stations and attending Kikuyu church service, bugging my friends to help with tenses. "It's been a journey but currently, I am better and can even connect words and sing in my mother tongue." Kareh B is one of the big names in Mugithi industry thanks to her many collabos with Jose Gatutura. Among their most well-known collabos is "Tuirio twega". Kareh B is also a stage and film actress who has featured on shows like 'Tahidi High' and also in Gĩkũyũ plays.
