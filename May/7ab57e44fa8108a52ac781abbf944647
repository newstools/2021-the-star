The Swedish government has adopted a new development strategy for Kenya for the period 2021-2025. Foreign Affairs CS Raychelle Omamo and the minister for International Development Co-operation of the Kingdom of Sweden, Olsson Fridh, held bilateral talks, with the aim of the two countries working together. The Swedish government intends to continue working with Kenya on issues concerning gender equality, climate change and other environment related strategies, urban development as well as democracy and human rights. Omamo and the Swedish minister agreed to establish a joint technical and economic cooperation with a view to enhance bilateral trade, investments between the two countries and to implement development cooperation in a more structured way. "We also agreed on the need for increased exchanges at various levels as a catalyst to deepening relations between the two countries," Omamo said. On the current situation in the region and the refugee situation, the two governments agreed to encourage dialogue amongst parties in conflict given Kenya’s important role in the region as a promoter of peace and security, and globally through its seat on the UN Security Council. The ministers also discussed global as well as multilateral affairs and pledged to maintain the close relationship in the multilateral arena so as to most effectively manage global challenges and opportunities. "Kenya´s hosting of the UN’s environmental hub was greatly appreciated. Sweden and Kenya would work together to ensure that the planned events in Nairobi (UNEP@50) as well as in Stockholm (Stockholm+50) would be successful," the CS said.
