Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho's stepsister Mwanaisha Ali Joho scored a mean grade of B+ in the 2020 KCSE exam. Mwanaisha sat for the test at the Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayeed Secondary School. Deputy principal Rishad Rajab said she was among the best girls in the institution. Governor Joho’s D- grade in the national examination has been a subject of ridicule. He has said it should be an inspiration to many that your grades do not determine who you become in life. Teachers and students at Sheikh Khalifa described Mwanaisha as a humble, disciplined and dutiful student. “She was a hard-working student and despite coming from a prominent family in the region, she always kept a low profile at school,” Rajab said. Mwanaisha, who is media-shy, did not wish to talk to the press. Sheikh Khalifa had 224 candidates for the 2020 KCSE exam. Rajab said they had a class of 116 girls and 108 boys. He said the girls’ performance in the examination was better than boys. “When schools were closed because of Covid-19, we had online classes, but our boys did not pay full concentration during these classes and that is why our girls are leading,” he said. Rajab said that the teachers worked closely with the candidates. Sheikh Khalifa had one A plain, 29 A- (minuses), 59 B+, 39 B- (minuses), 25 C+, nine C plains and three C- (minuses). The best student at the coast was Sheikh Khalifa’s Assya Abubakar with an A of 82 points. Assya, who wishes to study medicine, said she had hoped to score an A- (minus). “I had scored a B in the mock examinations. I did not hope to score more than an A- (minus) in KCSE, but I thank God for his grace,” Abubakar said. She said the teachers played a critical role in delivering the good results.
