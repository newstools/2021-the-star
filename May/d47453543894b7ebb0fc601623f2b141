The debate on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 resumed in the Senate on Thursday morning ahead of the planned voting in the afternoon. This comes even as a section of senators continues to push for an amendment of the document to realign it with the constitution. According to the order paper, the Bill would proceed to the third reading stage on Thursday afternoon where members would vote on it. Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said that there were no amendments proposed in the second stage. The speaker said that there are amendments that have been proposed by the committee of the whole. He assured the House that he will make a ruling before the committee of the whole stage. "It will be a well-researched ruling, well reasoned. I am not a speaker by accident. I have a competent team and I will give a reasoned ruling," Lusaka said. The two Houses of Parliament are this week deciding on whether lawmakers can amend the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 after the heated debate last week. While MPs appear to agree the House cannot change the bill, a near-unanimous call by senators to correct ‘typographical and referential errors’ and expunge ‘unconstitutional’ clauses could give the proponents sleepless nights. In the Senate, Speaker Ken Lusaka has gazetted three days of special sittings beginning Tuesday to among others conclude the consideration of the bill. Though the Constitution provides that the bill would proceed to a referendum whether or not Parliament approves it, revelations of conflicting versions and the clamour to amend the document pose serious headaches to its proponents.
