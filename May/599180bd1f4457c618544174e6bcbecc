This is it. This is the moment we've all been waiting for. The brand new car is finally going to get it's owner! After months of waiting, the big day is here. More than 10,000 Kenyans participated in the campaign, now belatedly concluding. The event will be held today from 10am-1pm at the Trade Mark Hotel. It was scheduled to take place on March 27 but was postponed due to the revised measures announced by the President last month to combat the spread of Covid-19. ParticipationAll that was required was a simple registration on the Kiss 100 website (https://kiss100.co.ke/kissmyride/ ) leaving correct details and then making sure you're tuned in to Kiss 100 every day to listen if your name will be called out on air. Everyday 9am, 2pm and 5pm, there was a draw. If you had successfully registered and your name called out on air, you had exactly 15 minutes to call and claim your entry. That entry will be a key which gave you a chance to win the car. Today, all entrants will be invited to try whether their key opens the car. Whoever's key opens the car will be the lucky winner who walks away with a brand new car. All we can say is good luck to the entrants! See you at The Trademark Hotel from 10AM today.
