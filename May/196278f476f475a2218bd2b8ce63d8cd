The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company has announced there will be an interruption of water supply to customers served from Kabete and Sasumua Treatment works. The interruption is set to start on Thursday from 6 am to Friday at 6 am. The company stated that the shutdown will facilitate the repair of the Sasumua treated water transmission pipeline at the Aberdare forest and the interconnection of the Kabete Resorvoirs outlet pipes with the relocated distribution pipeline along Waiyaki Way at the communication Authority Headquarters due to the ongoing construction of Waiyaki Way-Rironi road. "Once the works are completed, it will enable release of the road section between Communication Authority Headquarters and the junction of James Gichuru and Waiyaki Way to the Waiyaki Way-Rironi Road Contractor," Nairobi Water said in a statement. Riruta, Kawangware, Dagoretti Corner and Ngando are the areas along Naivasha Road that will be affected. In areas along Ngong Road, Kilimani, City Mortuary, Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi Hospital, Coptic Hospital, State House, Department of Defence Headquarters, Lavington, Kileleshwa, Kibera, Forces Memorial Hospital, KEMRI, Golf Course Estate, Kenyatta, Karen and areas along Gitanga among others will have water interruptions.
