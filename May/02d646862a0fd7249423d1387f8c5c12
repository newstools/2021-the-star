Airtel Networks Kenya Limited customers will continue to enjoy reduced cash withdrawal charges across all bands and free transactions while sending money within the Airtel network. In a statement on Thursday, Managing Director Prasanta Das Sarma said they will revise its Airtel Money tariff effective June 3, 2021. "The new changes will affect charges on cash withdrawals from Airtel Money agents and the cost of money transfer to other networks," Sarma said. The new tariff will see Airtel customers continue to enjoy reduced cash withdrawal charges across all bands and free transactions while sending money within the Airtel network. The cost of sending money (person to person) to other networks has also been revised. All Airtel customers will still transfer up to Sh100 to any customer on any network free of charge. There will be no daily limit to the number of such transactions. All transactions from Airtel Money wallets to customers’ bank accounts will also remain free of charge. Airtel has also simplified its mobile money tariffs by reducing the transaction bands from the previous 20 to 12 bands. This will make it easier for customers and agents to understand and interpret the transaction costs. The service charge on cash withdrawals has also been reduced across all bands to encourage more customers to transact on Airtel Money. For example, withdrawing Sh500 will now cost its customers Sh22 from Sh27. Airtel Kenya, Managing Director, Prasanta Das Sarma said: “We have reviewed our Airtel Money transaction fees to enable our customers to continue enjoying affordable prices while transacting through their mobile money wallets.  Our customers can now easily transact without fear of excessive charges, as a result of the reduced withdrawal costs from agents.”
