A ruling on whether senators can amend the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 will be made before the lawmakers take a final vote on the bill. Speaker Kenneth Lusaka said he will give a detailed ruling on the matters after a section of senators pushed him to pronounce himself on whether the House can amend the document. "At the second stage, there are no amendments that have been proposed. I will make a ruling when the bill gets to the Committee of the whole house. I will give a researched and detailed ruling," he said. Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua triggered the push on the floor on Thursday morning. He sought to know from the speaker the fate of a raft of amendments he has proposed in a letter to the speaker last week. "I have tabled five amendments. I request that you give a reasoned ruling on each of the proposed amendments to know where we stand on this issue," Wambua said. Wambua, Irungu Kangata (Murang'a), and Cherargei (Nandi) have all are written to the speaker seeking his nod to introduce the amendment. Nairobi senator Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi), Mutula Kilonzo Jr (Makueni), and Moses Wetangula (Bungoma) supported Wambua's call for a ruling from the speaker. " I know you have deferred many rulings, this one you will not defer. This one, you have to rule," Mutula said. According to the order paper, the Bill would proceed to the third reading stage on Thursday afternoon where members would vote on it.
