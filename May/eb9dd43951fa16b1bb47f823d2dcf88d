Singer Tanasha Donna says she will get married in 2023. In a post she shared, Tanasha highlighted the qualities she is looking for in a man she will get married to. "Dear future husband 2023, we can build this legacy together, but bear in mind I don't play games. Either you're mine or you're not. If a girl is flirting with you, you better tell her bye, or I'll tell you bye," she wrote. In a different post, she thanked all her fans who have been part of her growth. "If you were ever in my life and made me smile more than anything... I just wanna say thank you from the bottom of my heart." Tanasha and Diamond broke up last year in February but the two are raising a son together.
