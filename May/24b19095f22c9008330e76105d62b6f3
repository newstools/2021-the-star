Small-scale tea farmers in Bomet want the government to eliminate hurdles hindering the implementation of reforms in the sector. They said delaying the implementation of the tea reforms would defeat the intention of ensuring farmers access markets and get value for their money. They said they don't want to wait longer to get better returns from their crop, yet that is what informed the reforms being undertaken by the Kenya Tea Development Agency. The farmers, led by Cheruiyot Baliach from Konoin, also urged new factories' directors not to collude with cartels in the sector. “We want to enjoy the fruits of these reforms beginning July, we do not want any further delay on this otherwise we shall lose the meaning of these reforms,”  he said. Baliach said tea farmers depend on the crop to feed their families and pay their children's school fees.
