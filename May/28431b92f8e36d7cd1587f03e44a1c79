The Selection Panel for Appointment of Commissioners to the IEBC has received over 700 applications for the four vacant position in the electoral agency. Speaking to journalists, the panel's chairperson Elizabeth Muli said they will publish all the applicants' names next week before it embarks on shortlisting. The panel advertised for the positions through a Gazette notice dated May 1, and interested applicants had up to May 17 to apply. “The selection panel wishes to inform the public that at the close of the application period, over 700 applications were received for the four vacancies in the position of IEBC member,” Muli said. “Pursuant to the provision of paragraph 3(1) of the IEBC Act, 2011, the selection panel will commence the shortlisting exercise and shall therefore publish the names of the short-listed candidates.” Muli was accompanied by James Awori, Gideon Solonka, Elizabeth Meyo, Joseph Mutie and Faridun Abdalla who are all members of the panel. After short-listing, the team will invite public views on the suitability of the candidates. Last month, the panel issued a road map that will see the filing of the four vacancies by June. According to the panel’s timeline, interviews for the shortlisted candidates will be conducted for five days from May 31 and June 4. The panel however noted it could slightly vary given the number of candidates. The panel hopes to settle on the successful candidates and forward the names to President Uhuru Kenyatta on or about June 9. “The selection panel reiterates that the timelines it has provided are provisional and ambitious but are also achievable,” Muli said last month. IEBC is currently operating with three commissioners after four commissioners exited immediately after the 2017 General Election. The commission currently has chairman Wafula Chebukati, commissioners Boya Molu and Abdi Guliye. Those who resigned include Roselyn Akombe, Paul Kurgat, Margaret Mwachanya and Connie Maina.
