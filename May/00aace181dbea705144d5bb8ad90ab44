More than 80 families in Mombasa and Nairobi are set to benefit from food donations worth more than Sh300,000 to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadhan. The donation by DIB Bank of Kenya on Thursday was made to organizations in Nairobi and Mombasa to be distributed among vulnerable members of the community. The donations were made to Good Hope Markazil Banatil Islamia Centre, a children’s home in Kariobangi which hosts and supports 110 orphans, the WAQF Commission of Kenya and Masjid and Markaz Assalaam Trust in Mombasa. “At DIB, the well-being of people is an important value we uphold and we aim to play our role in support of the community,” DIB Bank Kenya CEO Peter Makau said during the handover at Markazil Banatil Islamia Centre. “We are delighted to be here in Kariobangi to touch these children’s lives especially as they mark the end of the holy month of Ramadhan,” Makau added. This is the third year that DIB Bank Kenya Limited is partnering with the Muslim community to cushion the vulnerable as they celebrate Ramadhan. Last year, the Bank donated food to three different institutions in Nairobi and Mombasa. As the world battles the Covid-19 Pandemic and many are grappling with the harsh economic situation, DIB Bank has continued supporting its customers and the needy. The Bank has also recently expanded its banking services to include PesaLink money transfer which is an efficient and convenient mode of payment. The government declared next Friday a public holiday to mark Idd-ul-Fitr. The festival of Idd-ul-Fitr, the Festival of Fast-breaking, is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. Muslims celebrate Idd-ul-Fitr with prayers called "Salat Al Eid" in Arabic.
