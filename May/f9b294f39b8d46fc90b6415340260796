Kirinyaga residents have been urged to move to safer grounds and be on the lookout for floods and mudslides. County meteorological director Peter Wambugu said the ongoing heavy downpour will continue for the better part of the month. He advised those living in the uplands and lowland areas of Mwea to move to safer grounds. “We expect the rains will increase in the remaining days of the week. However, we predict the amount of rainfall will subside in the third and fourth week respectively. We therefore urge all residents to be on the watch out. Wambugu further advised residents to stay away from rivers as they are swollen to avoid loss of lives and property. Parents with children, who have to cross rivers daily to and from school, have been urged to look for alternative routes for the safety of their children. Motorists plying through various roads within the county have been urged to adhere to traffic rules to prevent accidents. “There will be minimal visibility and the roads will be slippery. Motorists using Mwea-Embu highway, Kutus-Kagio-Sagana road and Kutus-Kerugoya-Karatina road should drive cautiously," Wambugu said. Farmers have also been advised to take advantage of the ongoing rains to plant trees and harvest water for use during the dry season.
