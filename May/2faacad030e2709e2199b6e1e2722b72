A notorious suspect known for stupefying unsuspecting revelers in Kiambu County and its environs, has been arrested alongside her accomplice. Irene Irungu who plies her trade as ‘Michelle’ for fear of her true identity being unmasked, has been arrested after being on the run for many days. Her accomplice Peter Wambugu was also arrested. The suspect who operates in various clubs within Kiambu looking for her next victim has been described as notorious for spiking revelers’ drinks with a drug that tranquilizes them for up to to 12 hours. After the victims are knocked down, Irungu robs them of their money and other valuables. “She has perfected her art in what is commonly described as ‘wekaing Mchele’ to the point of acquiring dozens of SIM Cards, where she deposits money stolen from stupefied victims’ bank accounts,'' DCI Director George Kinoti said. After she successfully transfers the money, she then withdraws it without raising any suspicion. “Irene is suspected to be heading a syndicate of notorious criminals who prey on unsuspecting revelers, making merry in drinking joints within Ruaka and its environs in Kiambu county,” he said. Detectives based at Kiambaa have previously received reports from tenants who have lost every household item they owned, including their clothes, bedding and utensils, after they entertained a reveler whose description fits that of the suspect. Dozens of SIM cards, mobile phones and wrist watches suspected to have been stolen from her ‘Mchele’ victims were recovered from her custody. The suspects are currently at Karuri Police station, as they wait to be presented before court on Monday. Also recovered from her was the drug used in stupefying her victims, suspected to be used in the treatment of panic attacks.
