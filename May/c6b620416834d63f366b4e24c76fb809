Two people died on the spot after a lorry rammed into a boda boda shed near St Joseph's Primary School junction in Webuye along the Malaba-Eldoret highway. The morning accident caused a traffic snarl-up of about an hour. The two who died were women who were sheltering from the rain in the shed. Eight boda boda riders and the driver of the lorry escaped unhurt. Bungoma East police boss Valerian Obore said the driver lost control of the lorry and the vehicle veered off the road ramming into the boda boda shed. Obore said they have launched investigations into the incident. Obore said the driver of the lorry has been arrested and is helping police with investigations. The police boss urged drivers plying the northern corridor highway to be careful and vigilant during the rainy season to avoid such accidents. The bodies were taken to Webuye County Hospital mortuary. Edited by A.N
