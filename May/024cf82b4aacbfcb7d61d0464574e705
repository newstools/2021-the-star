A police constable was arrested on Sunday after he allegedly fatally shot a love rival with an AK-47 rifle after a confrontation in Embakasi, police said. Police said the Sunday night shooting occurred outside a butchery in Kitindo area. Constable Titus Kirui is said to have accused Charles Karugu, 32 of taking away his girlfriend, police said. Witnesses told police that Kirui from Vila police station followed Karugu to the butchery where a confrontation erupted. Karuga was shot in the chest. The two men had apparently been dating the same woman; she was not present at the shooting. The officer is said to have escaped from the scene but he was arrested moments later and an AK-47 rifle assigned to him confiscated. Nairobi police boss Augustine Nthumbi said there was a love triangle element but his team was pursuing the matter. Police said they recovered a spent cartridge from the scene. The rifle had 27 bullets and was sent for  ballistic tests. The victim was pronounced dead on arrival at Mama Lucy Hospital. The officer was expected in court on Monday when police were to request more time to hold him while they investigate. It was the latest fatal shooting involving a policeman. The head of Directorate of Criminal Investigations in Embakasi, Simon Mutia Mwongela, was expected to take a murder plea over the shooting of night guard Lapaja Topiwo. The senior superintendent of police was arrested on May 13 after he argued with the night guard at the Night Square Hotel. Topiwo was shot twice in the chest. Arrests of police for misusing their weapons and causing deaths while on duty have been on the rise. Dozens of court cases are pending, involving police officers  involved in shootings that left some dead, others with serious wounds. (Edited by V. Graham)
