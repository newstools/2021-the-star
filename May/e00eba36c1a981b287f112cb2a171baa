After running a personal best of 30:49.23 in Stockholm, Sweden, Eva Cherono has set sights on a place in Team Kenya's women's  10,000m at this year's Tokyo Olympics. She finished third behind winner Sheila Chepkirui (30:45.81) and Joan Chelimo (30:46.51) during last weekend's Stockholm 25 laps to Tokyo competition in the Swedish capital. Cherono, who debuted at the senior level at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, believes an appearance at the quadrennial event will be a major step for her young athletics career at the top level. "Now, I want to fight for my place in the final team for 10,000m. A lot of things have changed since the Commonwealth Games when I was very young. I know the trials will be very heated but regardless my resolve remains to make the team," Cherono said. Cherono was among seven Kenyans who attained the qualifying mark of 31:25.00 in the 10,000m women's race, upping the battle for a ticket to Tokyo. Other Kenyan athletes in the same race who made the mark  include: Irene Cheptai (30:51.39); Daisy Cherotich (30:54.46) and Dorcas Kimeli (30:55.90). "My aim in Sweden was to at least run 31:25. So getting a personal best in the process is a wonderful feeling for me," she said. Her success in Stockholm came over a month after she finished second behind world 5,000m champion Hellen Obiri in the women's 10,000m  race at the 2nd leg of the Athletics Kenya track and field weekend Meet at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Similarly, Cherotich was exuberant and bullish about her chances of making the final team to Tokyo despite her fifth-place finish. "This (30:54) is my personal best and it shows that all my training is gradually paying off. My prayer to God is for everything to work out as I have planned it and to be among those representing the country at the Olympics," this year's Discovery Kenya Cross Country Championships winner said. Cherotich — who finished second in the 8km women's race in February's National Cross Country Championship  — added she has come back from the Stockholm Olympics Stadium with valuable lessons to incorporate in her training. She will be among Kenyan athletes lining up at the Doha Diamond League on May 28 although she will be competing in 3000m. "I want to even do more and lower my personal best. One of the plans is to work on my speed-work because I realise this will be very crucial for me if I am to excel at the trials for the Olympics. Doha will be a great opportunity to work on speed because it will be my first time competing in this race."
