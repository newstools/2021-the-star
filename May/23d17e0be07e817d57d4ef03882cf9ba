Three fishermen have been arrested in Suba South in connection with the death of their colleague after a disagreement in Lake Victoria. The three from Wadiang’a beach are being detained at Sindo police post. They are implicated in the death of Duncan Omondi after a disagreement during a fishing expedition. Omondi is said to have engaged in an argument with a colleague when they were sailing to Takawiri Island on Sunday. Wadiang’a Beach Management Unit secretary Collins Ochieng’ said Omondi disagreed with one of his colleagues. The tiff boiled over and they were about to exchange blows when Omondi slipped and fell into the lake. “The fishermen said Omondi slipped when he was going to exchange a blow with the colleague he had disagreed with,” Ochieng' said. “The other fishermen said they tried to rescue him from drowning.” The BMU officer said the fishermen accused Omondi of being drunk. Ochieng' said they recovered Omondi’s body after mobilising colleagues for a search. Suba subcounty police commander Antony Njeru said the three men have been detained to enable them to conduct a thorough probe to know what caused his death. “We don’t know whether they killed him and dumped his body in the lake or the fisherman drowned after slipping from the boat. Investigations will reveal the truth,” Njeru said. “We are going to hand them to our colleagues in Mbita to probe the matter further because the incident occurred in their jurisdiction.”  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
