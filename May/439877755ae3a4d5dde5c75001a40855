Newly appointed Mathare United head coach Frank Ouna says he's aware of the daunting task that awaits him ahead after he took over from long-serving Salim Ali on Tuesday. “I understand the task at hand and the only way to set things straight is to put points on the board. That is why I have been given the job,” Ouna told the club's website. The 44-year-old tactician who has previously handled Gor Mahia, Sofapaka and KCB said he has a lot of faith in the ability of the current squad to evade relegation by pulling off a great comeback in their remaining matches. “I know we can do it and improve on our situation because everything is already there in place. The players at my disposal are more than capable of turning things around and there is still so much to play for.” Salim Ali was ultimately shown the door following a string of poor outcomes in league encounters that left the Slum Boys rooted at the tail-end of the table and battling for survival. The KNVB trained and Caf A license holder’s first real test will be against bankers KCB at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on Wednesday. He says he's not ready to betray the trust the club has accorded him. “I want to first of all to thank the club’s hierarchy in placing confidence in me with this appointment. Mathare is a historical club and I am humbled to be here. Club CEO Jecton Obure said Ouna is a vastly experienced coach and this made it easy for them to decide on him. “We have complete faith that his appointment will coincide with us scaling up the log,” said Obure. Ouna held his first training session with the team on Tuesday morning.
