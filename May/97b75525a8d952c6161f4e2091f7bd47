A team of detectives has been dispatched to Lokichogio, Turkana county, to investigate the shooting of a senior immigration officer on Sunday morning. Philip Sitienei, 43, was shot dead while he was on his morning run on the Lokichoggio–Nadapal highway. He was targeted by two gunmen about two kilometres away from Lokichoggio town. Officials on the ground said he was shot in the head, leg and shoulder at around 7.30am. Sitienei had worked in Turkana for more than two years and was well-known to locals and those who regularly use the Kenya-South Sudan border. Police say the attackers had targeted Sitienei, who is not the only resident who runs in the morning on the highway. The motive of the attack is yet to be known. A multi-agency team was Sunday night sent to the area to pursue the matter. A spent cartridge was recovered from the scene and police said they will subject it to ballistic analysis to establish the source of the weapon used. A motorist spotted the body lying on the road about a kilometre from a military camp. Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai said the team will investigate the motive as part of the efforts to get the killers. “We condemn this heinous act with the strongest words possible. No stone will be left unturned until we get the killers of the civil servant,” Mutyambai said. Dozens of civil servants drawn from immigration, customs, police and others are deployed in the area to ensure free flow of goods and people on the border. The attack is likely to cause fears among those operating there and who are non-locals. But Mutyambai assured them of their safety. The border is among the busiest routes to Juba, South Sudan.
