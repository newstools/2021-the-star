Singer Bahati and Mr Seed have settled their longtime beef. The two had a bitter fallout in 2019 and have not been working together. Mr Seed opened up about their beef with the Bahatis a while ago, saying the owners of EMB had been issuing threats to him after he quit EMB. Mr Seed also said he left the record label after his wife Nimo was disrespected. Well, after so much drama with a lot of back and forth between Mr Seed and Bahati, they have decided to leave that in the past. After Seed released his new song featuring Cate Actress, 'Ndoa', Bahati showed his support, referring to him as his first brother. "Let's go on YouTube Watch & Take this to Number #1...
