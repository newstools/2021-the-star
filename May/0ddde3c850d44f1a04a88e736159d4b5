A suspect was on Thursday charged with stealing items from his father’s shop. Amos Njoroge told Kibera senior resident magistrate William Tulel he stole after killing a snake at a house close by. He said he was a God-fearing man and pleaded for forgiveness. “I killed a snake and after that I found myself in this situation, I never intended to steal the said items,” he told the court. He added, “I am God fearing and I take care of my mother; I have a small family.” The charge sheet reads that Njoroge committed the offence on diverse dates between April 18 and April 29 in Dagoreti sub-county within Nairobi county. The charge sheet says that he stole, 24 plastic seats, building material and other items all valued at Sh85,000 belonging to Francis Njoroge. According to court prosecutor Robert Ogallo, the complainant and his wife closed the shop and proceeded for a funeral and when they came back, they found the shop broken into and items stolen. He told the court that other items that were stolen from the shop included; food, 20 litters of paraffin, old rice and sodas. Ogallo told the court that the accused person was a first-time offender and urged the court to do its mandate. The magistrate directed that the accused person be remanded at the police station and a probation report be brought in court. He directed that both the accused person and the complainant be interviewed by the probation officer before the report is made. “Let the probation officer interview you together with the complainant and the probation report be filed in court before we sentence you,” he said. He directed that the case be mentioned on Thursday next week.
