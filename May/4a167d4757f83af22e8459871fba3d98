The government has released Sh7.5 billion to secondary schools in readiness for reopening for the third term on Monday. The funds will be used to prepare utilities necessary for schools to adhere to protocols to stem the spread of Covid-19. Managers will set up handwashing points, buy thermo guns and install fittings for proper classroom and dormitory ventilation. School administrators are required to compile a list of students with conditions that put them at risk of severe Covid-19 infection. The third term beginning May 10 is the last stretch in the road to recover the time lost to school closures in March 2020. The term will run up to July 16. Learners expected to report to their schools are those in PP1 and PP2, Grade 1 to 3, Standard 5 to 7 and Form 1 to Form 3. Maintaining social distancing still remains a major challenge in most schools. Education CS George Magoha in January admitted public schools could not conform to the requirement, noting that masks would be relied upon in preventing infections. Magoha said that the ministry had requested the Treasury to  release a further Sh13 billion for the secondary schools and Sh2.8 billion for primary schools to cater for operations upon reopening. “We therefore hope that schools will be adequately prepared to put in place measures to adhere to the Ministry of Health Covid-19 protocols.” Magoha in April directed inspection of schools to ensure adherence to the prescribed Covid-19 safety protocols. “We are scheduled to reopen schools for third term on May 10, 2021 for all classes except Grade 4 and Form 1,” Magoha said while releasing the 2020 KCPE exams. On Friday, Magoha said the Ministry had directed filed officers to ensure that all schools are ready to accept learners on Monday.  (edited by o. owino)
