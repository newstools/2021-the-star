Kiambu Governor James Nyoro has said the health department is producing oxygen and improving equipment in hospitals to be able to fight the Indian Covid-19 variant. "This is the time to prepare because we have heard about the Indian variant in Kenya or even prepare in case of a fourth wave,"  the governor said. Nyoro on Saturday received PPE, sanitiser and face masks from Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition worth Sh5 million. The material will distributed to traders in Madaraka market. The governor said the county has invested in opening up health facilities and making sure they are equipped. He said that the third wave had hit the county hard, with over 100 patients admitted. He said the situation could have been worse were the county not prepared to deal with the virus. "Next week we are opening the Ruiru Level 4 Hospital with a bed capacity of 150. We will also keep all our other facilities ready. We are installing oxygen in Ruiru and ensuring that we have adequate oxygen in all our facilities in case of another wave," Nyoro said. The county boss said the national government through the World Bank funding, will provide the county with oxygen for one year. The county is investing in having a big oxygen tank for the donation. He said they have been able to manage the Covid-19 numbers, with fewer than 10 patients in Tigoni Covid-19 centre. One patient is in Intensive Care Unit. "We are hoping that if this trend continues within the next 10 days, we may not have a Covid-19 patient in our facilities. That does not mean that we will relax as now that the lockdown was lifted we need to be on our toes and prepared," said Nyoro. He thanked Kiambu medical staff for being at the forefront in the fight against Covid-19. The county chief said health facilities in the county have never been overwhelmed by the pandemic due to good preparations. The governor said the county is keen on continuing to manage Covid-19 and will not let their guard down. -Edited by SKanyara
