The government is tracing applicants and delivering Huduma cards to residents of Kiambu who have shown little interest to collect them. Civil registration officials led by chiefs and their assistants are moving from village to another urging people who have not collected their cards to do so. They are also delivering those that have been lying in their offices to the owners they have been able to identify. Limuru deputy county commissioner Charles Mukele on Wednesday said a number of young people had been sent SMSs to collect their cards but they may have changed their phone numbers. He said others got jobs in far areas and are unable to come and collect their cards. Mukele said they resorted to the drive following reports that people were slow in collecting their cards, even after receiving short text messages from the government. “We have resorted to using chiefs, assistant chiefs and Nyumba Kumi officials to trace these people. We are managing since every day we are delivering over 50 cards. We shall not stop since we know all these cards belong to the locals,” Mukele said. In Lari, officials are conducting a similar exercise led by deputy county commissioner Agnes Karoki. Lari residents have supported the government’s move urging people to come out  to check whether their cards have been printed. Resident George Karari said it was a shame that people who had received SMSs had not bothered to collect their cards. “I took my brother to the Civil Registry offices in Lari to collect his card after he received an SMS. I asked the officials to check whether mine had been produced even though I had seen a message. To my surprise, it had been printed and I collected it,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
