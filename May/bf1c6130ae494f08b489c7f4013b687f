Embu county's 1,200 fish farmers will soon have a market to sell their produce to customers. The county government has promised to establish an open-air market for fish farmers in Embu town. The Department of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, and Cooperative Development has distributed more than 80,000 fingerlings to farmers groups to boost fish production. The county has also restocked dams around the county with different species and trained farmers on fish rearing, harvesting and preparation for diners. Agriculture executive Suleiman Kariuki said the farmers sell fish for between Sh500 and Sh800 a piece in Embu town. The county plans to market aquaculture in the county and sell the surplus to neighbouring Kirinyaga, Kitui, Tharaka Nithi and Machakos. “It’s our role as the county government to ensure that the farmers have a market for their produce. This will just be the beginning. We will link fish farmers to external markets as well,” Kariuki said. Governor Martin Wambora has been urging residents to diversify their agricultural practices for extra income. Embu farmers have mainly grown tea, maize, beans, and coffee but the fortunes of these crops have been dwindling. “Agriculture is our pillar number one, the bread that feeds the nation and brings in foreign exchange,” Wambora said. Embu residents have been encouraged to eat more fish for better nutrition. Fish is a rich source of protein that is vital for physical and mental growth.  (edited by o. owino)
