Football Kenya Federation national executive member Michael Majua has urged retired players to consider pursuing coaching as a career. Majua made the remarks after presiding over the closing ceremony of a ten-day CAF D coaching course at the Ligi Ndogo grounds. “I would like to appreciate the former players who have taken part in this coaching course and would like to encourage others like them to take part in these courses and help in steering our vision of improving the standards of football through capacity building of coaches,” he said. Majua has applauded the former players including James Situma, Ronald Okoth, and Joackins Atudo, who were among the 40 participants who were taken through the course by Caf instructors George Mwangi and Leon Matthews. Meanwhile, 36 more coaches who underwent training at the Lumakanda Township in Kakamega North were also certified. The course was organized by FKF in conjunction with the Ministry of Sports and the Kakamega County government with an aim of developing grassroots football. Fifa Instructors Fred Serenge and Hesborn Nyabinge conducted the training. Earlier on, 31 participants from Siaya also got certified. At least 107 coaches were certified in the Caf  ‘D’ coaching course across three counties.
