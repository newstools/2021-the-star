Kenya Ports Authority coach Sammy Mulinge said the team is behind schedule even as the team resumes training next week ahead of their matches against the General Service Unit and Kenya Army in mid-June. The Makande-based side returned home early this month following their exploits at the African Club Championship in Tunisia. KPA finished fifth in their first time of asking and were consequently granted some time off to recover. With their rivals GSU back in training, Mulinge admitted they have little time to fix their inadequacies but will try to get the best out of his players. KPA lead the standings with 19 points after winning six of the seven matches. Second-placed GSU have 17 points and the match could be crucial as both teams battle for playoff slots. KPA were runners-up in 2019 and have set their eyes on winning the title. "I wanted to have players in good time probably one week after Tunisia but it did not work out. We are behind schedule and the time left is not enough for thorough preparations. The boys are still young and need continuous, vigorous training but we will go with what we have," said the former APR coach. Nonetheless, Mulinge questioned the Kenya Volleyball Federation League management on why the men's game continues to be played outside. He observed that there are venues that can host the indoor version of the game-challenging KVF to review their plans in a bid to make the men's game competitive both locally and internationally. The ladies matches are played at Nyayo gymnasium while the men's game will be played at Kakamega approved school and  Kibos main prison "It's a pity the league matches are scheduled outside again when Kasarani, the KPA hall in Mombasa and Nyayo can host the league matches.  KVF should see the essence of having the competition indoor." "Kenya teams find it tougher to adjust to the indoor game during the international assignments because they are not used to indoor facilities."
