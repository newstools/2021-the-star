Lawyers at the Coast have responded to the plight of elders rescued from Kilifi over accusations of practicing witchcraft. Members of the  Law Society of Kenya from Mombasa and Malindi donated food supplies and clothes to the elders housed at Mekatilili Rescue and Resource Centre. They elders enjoyed lunch with the lawyers and danced in gratitude for the donation. Mombasa LSK vice chairperson Christine Kipsang who led the delegation of lawyers said she first got wind of the rescue centre after calling senior lawyer Joseph Karisa Mwarandu who founded the facility. Mwarandu showed her a video of the elders staying in pathetic conditions and she decided to help them. The lawyers contributed funds to buy household items and other relief supplies for the elders. Lawyers are working on amendment of the Witchcraft Act, she said. Coast LSK vice chair Conrad Atiang said they are happy to offer support to the elders and promised more. He said they will push for policy changes so that the problem can be addressed and the perpetrators prosecuted. Mwarandu said they came up with the idea of a rescue centre following cases of elders being lynched on suspicion of being witches. “Ever since we started this centre, we have not received any support from the county or national governments. We are happy that now colleagues from the legal fraternity are coming on board to support,” he said. Mwarandu said the rescued elders lack proper housing, food and medication. Edited by Henry Makori
