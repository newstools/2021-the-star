Socialite Vera Sidika has dissociated herself from all her ex-boyfriends, saying her focus is now on her husband musician Brown Mauzo. In a Q&A session via her Insta-stories, a curious fan asked whether she still had feelings for ‘OB’, a short term used to describe her ex, singer Otile Brown. Vera responded, "Well, I don’t know who ob is, but I only have feelings for my hubby." Vera and Otile dated for a few months before breaking up. Another fan also sought to know if she misses her ex-boyfriend Yomi. Vera said it's been five years since she heard that name, terming it old news. Vera is currently married to Brown Mauzo. In March, she was also tasked to defend herself after being told she 'settled for less' by marrying musician Brown Mauzo.
