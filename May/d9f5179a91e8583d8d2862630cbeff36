Supermodel Naomi Campbell has welcomed her first child. Campbell took to social media to announce her great news expressing her delight to be a mom. "A beautiful little blessing has chosen me to be her mother," she wroteÂ on Instagram. "So honoured to have this gentle soul in my life there are no words to describe the lifelong bond that I now share with you my angel. There is no greater love." She followed up the news with a hearty picture of her hand holding the newborn's feet. The news caught people by surprise as the 50-year-old supermodel made no public acknowledgment that she was expecting a baby. In January, Campbell made headlines in the country when she was crowned Magical Kenya's International Tourism Ambassador by the the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife. She was tasked to help promote Kenya as an ideal tourism and travel destination to the world. The decision by Balala sparked mixed reactions on social media, with some users, including politicians, criticising the choice of appointing the British supermodel instead of Kenya's own international movie star Lupita Nyong'o or other popular celebrities in the country.
