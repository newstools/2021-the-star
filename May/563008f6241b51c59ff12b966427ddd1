A witness has identified three officers from Kamukunji police station who allegedly freed a Ugandan man charged with abducting another officer. Constable Unice Chebet, who is also attached to the station, identified Corporal Vacity Chebet Keres, and constables Stephen Akuom Ochieng and Elias Koom Mungaria. Keres, Ochieng and Mungaria have since denied the charges. They are represented by lawyers led by William Aruseli. Chebet identified the officers through CCTV played before Milimani principal magistrate Esther Kimilu. She said Martin Wasike was taken out of Kamukunji police station cell at night by the trio who were on duty on May 13. Chebet said Wasike's escape was noticed when she and her two colleagues reported on duty in the morning. They opened the cells to count suspects and noticed that one of them, Wasike, was missing. They were informed by the remaining suspects that Wasike was taken out at night by one of the officers who were on duty. Through CCTV footage, Chebet identified the three accused persons as the ones who were on duty that night. The footage showed Wasike being taken out of the cells and escorted outside the station. Wasike and his two accomplices had been held at the station awaiting their hearing date to be fixed after they denied the charges of kidnapping with intent to murder. They had been charged with abducting Constable Abel Misati of Kamukunji police station earlier in January last year. Wasike disappeared from the police station a day after he was charged. The three cops are out on Sh200,000 bail pending the hearing and determination of the case. Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations at the station had narrowed down to the three after reviewing the CCTV footage which identified them as culpable for the escape. The hearing was adjourned to June 22.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
