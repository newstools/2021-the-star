A prison warden in Mwingi accused of killing wife and son will be detained five more days after the prosecution requested more time to gather evidence. David Nduati Kimani, who was arraigned at the Mwingi law courts on Thursday, is accused of shooting dead Joyce Mwende and son Rajj Mwende on Tuesday night. He surrendered his firearm to the officers at the main gate and tried to flee but was arrested. On Thursday, the prosecution requested more time to gather evidence and get postmortem reports. Mwingi resident magistrate I D Ruhu granted the request and gave the prosecution until Wednesday next week when the accused will be taken back to court. Kimani will be detained at the Mwingi Central police station. In the same court, seven people were charged with violating curfew rules. They were arrested in various parts of Mwingi town on Wednesday night. They pleaded guilty to the charges and asked for leniency, saying they were outside their houses due to unavoidable circumstances. Some said they had ventured out of their houses to seek medical attention while others said their vehicles developed mechanical problems and they could not abandoned them on the road. They were each fined Sh2,000 or be remanded at Waita GK prison for 14 days.
