The Palestine government has recognized the efforts of Muslims for Human Rights in fostering peace and protection of human rights across the world, and specifically for the people of Palestine. In a letter to Muhuri chair Khelef Khalifa, the Palestinian ambassador to Kenya Hazem Shabat thanked Khalifa for ‘wholeheartedly standing in solidarity with the people of Palestine during the latest provocations and atrocities perpetrated by Israel, the Occupying Power, in Occupied Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, the rest of Palestinian Occupied Territory.’ “We have been keenly following the “Free Palestine” Peaceful Processions you organized together with your team, both in Nairobi and Mombasa and in this regard, we wish to extend our appreciation for your high sense of solidarity,” wrote Shabat in the letter dated May 27. On May 14 and 17, Muhuri led protests in Nairobi and Mombasa respectively against the bombardment of the Gaza Strip in Palestine calling for the resolution of the differences between the warring nations. Khalifa accused the international communities of doing little to resolve the issue, which he warned could easily lead to another World War. On Thursday, Shabat said the role the protests played in achieving the ceasefire was ‘splendid’ and ‘invaluable’ and cannot be wished away, even though the aspired peace and respect for universal rights have not been achieved in Jerusalem. “Not only has your calls championed the government of the Republic of Kenya’s stance on the question of Palestine, but also was part of a bigger worldwide solidarity calls for the right to self-determination and respect for inalienable rights of Palestinians,” Shabat noted. He encouraged Muhuri to continue with their peaceful activism, solidarity and spreading of factual awareness to build up sufficient pressure to ensure that universally recognized values of dignity, inalienable human rights, peace and security for all is realised. “I avail myself of this opportunity to extend to you the assurances of my highest consideration,” Shabat said.
