Nyamira MCAs on Thursday questioned the delay in utilisation of devolution support program funds. Addressing the issue in the assembly, the MCAs said Nyamira Finance CEC needed to explain why Sh87 million that was given as grant to the devolved unit has not been utilised. The money that was given as grant to the county government for the financial year 2019- under the Devolution Support Programme,  has been in the account for two years now, prompting the Speaker to direct the Finance committee to have the CEC Finance to explain the same. Magombo Ward MCA Richard Onyinkwa said it was prudent for the CEC to explain why the money had not been put into use and demanded that the CEC ensures the money is in use for projects in the county. “We want to know what purpose the money is meant to serve. Instead of just being kept in the bank, let it be allocated to one of the projects before the end of this financial year,” Onyinkwa said. “We need to know why the monies have been idle in the bank for two years. For that reason, the Finance and planning CEC is required to appear before the committee on finance to give more details on this matter in 14 days,” Speaker Moffat Teya said during the Thursday session. -Edited by SKanyara
