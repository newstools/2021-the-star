Work on an airport in Nyamira could start soon after Kenya Civil Aviation Authority officils visited the site on Thursday. The delegation was joined by Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo for site investigation on the proposed Kiendege airport in Kitutu Masaba. The KCAA officials have been in Nyamira for the last two days to prepare a report and collect public views before the launch of the project. Residents have held public participation forums but Nyaribo said more sessions to discuss the project will be held. The airport, Sironga Agro Industrial Business Park, Esanige Green Stadium in Magwagwa ward, Ekerenyo Subcounty Hospital are some of the projects to be funded by the national government. Governor Nyaribo said the project will improve the economy of the county, increase the price of land and create jobs. “With the industrial Park at Sironga, this airport will be of great importance to this region and it will create employment to our young people. We call upon our residents to welcome this project for the betterment of our county,” Nyaribo said. Head of KCAA delegation Rashid Abdalla said they will generate a report to expedite the start of the project. “We look up to the people of Nyamira for cooperation for the smooth commencement of the project,” Abdallah said. The governor urged those who grabbed land from the project to start moving out of the area to allow for a smooth take off. County commissioner Amos Mariba told residents they will get first consideration for jobs created through the project.  (edited by o. owino)
