Malkia  Strikers' coach Paul Bitok Malkia Strikers can pull surprises against South Korea and Dominican Republic during the Tokyo Olympic Games in July. Malkia Strikers are in Pool 'A' alongside hosts Japan,  Brazil, Serbia, Dominican Republic and South Korea . They open their campaign on July 25 against Japan but believes the hosts will have slight advantage by virtue of playing at home. "We are analysing the Japanese team videos before coming up with a game plan. We led them 2-0 sets during 2018 World Cup  but ran out of gas to hand them victory. We want to work on our blocks and reception because that was our main undoing the last time we met," he noted. Kenya finished 11th in the 2004 version of the game and will be seeking to improve on the position 16 years down the lane. "Brazil and Serbia are highly ranked than Kenya and in a league of their own. I must, therefore, admit that facing them will be a herculean task but we can match Japan, South Korea and Dominican Republic," he bragged. Bitok said Malkia Strikers have made strides under the guidance of the Brazilian coaches hence they look more sharper. "The machines used to identify the load of the players and their fitness levels are a bonus to the team. Weight lifting is now a routine and the players are in a better shape," Bitok said He asserted lack of fans in the Tokyo will not affect  Malkia Strikers' performance. "All we need is to adjust to the unprecedented times," he added.
