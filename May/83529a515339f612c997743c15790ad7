Gor Mahia midfielder Kenneth Muguna is excited by the return to team training after the Covid-19 control restrictions were eased allowing sports to return. The suspension of sports last month meant that clubs could not engage in sessions with players resorting to individual training regimes to keep fit. “Training individually is not always fun but when you have your friends around, it’s fun. Right now the mood is great and we are all eager for the league to resume as soon as possible,” said Muguna. Gor were scheduled to play against Wazito yesterday when FKF announced the resumption of the topflight campaign but it was postponed yet again to allow all Premier League sides to undergo Covid tests. “We have missed training and this is a big step for the return of the games and we hope we can return to training as soon as possible,” observed the Kenyan international. Despite his team having fallen far off the title race, skipper Harun Shakava was adamant that the champions will not let go their crown easily. “It’s been a tough season but we are not giving up. We have the whole of the second leg to make things right and challenge for the title,” said the experienced defender. Gor’s Brazilian coach Vaz Pinto was equally elated to return to work with his players after a one month sabbatical. “We have missed training a lot. It’s important for us to make sure our players are ready to resume the league,” said Vaz Pinto. “The players have shown a lot of commitment since we returned to training and they are anxious for the league to return,” added the Brazilian tactician. Pinto was, however, concerned that after nearly fifty days without playing, his players had a short time to get into shape and he was worried that the tight schedule may make them susceptible to injuries.
