Comedian Prof Hamo has apologised for his affair with Jemutai, saying he is working towards being a responsible person, dad, husband and man. His statement comes days after DNA tests confirmed he is the father of Jemutai’s two children. Jemutai had accused him of neglect. Hamo apologised to Jemutai and his wife Zippy and said they are working towards resolving their issues in private. “If an apology is to be made then it should be soul-searched, true and from deep down," he said. "Apologies are made when someone realises and owns up to their mistakes. I had to go back to family and make good with them; otherwise, all this would have been a facade. We are patching up things, not there yet but headed there by His grace.” Hamo further thanked his baby mama Jemutai for agreeing to have a sit-down with him and agree on how they will raise their children, and his wife for accomodating him despite his shortcomings. “I would like to thank my boss-turned-mentor, Mr Daniel Ndambuki ‘Churchill’, and life coach Robert Burale, for instilling vital knowledge and wisdom in us tukikunywa kale ka chai kamejaa maziwa miiingi!” Hamo hoped his kids will forgive him when they are old enough to understand. Addressing his exit from Royal Media Services, Hamo said he parted ways with their station three weeks before his drama surfaced online. "And to you my fans. Without you, I am just Herman. With you, I am Prof Hamo. Kindly allow me to add another chapter in “My Book Of...” I am deeply sorry for letting you down," he said. "I am not yet there but working towards being a responsible person, dad, husband and man."
