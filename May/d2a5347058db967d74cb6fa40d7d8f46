The Migori county government has promoted 1,143 workers after interviews by the County Public Service Board. More than 1,300 staff were due for promotion last year. Migori CPSB chair Jared Kopiyo said the board has raised concerns over a bulging wage bill. “Migori is spending a lot of funds on wages at the expense of development and any means of downsizing the wage bill is welcome,” he said. The Health department had the biggest number of promoted staff at 693 followed by the Finance department with 113 workers. “We know the officers will put their best effort to offer services to people,” Kopiyo said. He said they are still grappling with issues of ghost workers and an audit of the payroll will be done to cut wastage. Vice chair Jemima Were said the board is committed to ensuring that the county has a payroll system that is above board. The county has over 3,000 workers in its payroll. In a 2018 head count, the county found it was losing Sh7.5 million a month to undeserving staff. A total of 48 employees who had deserted duties were taking home Sh869,960 per month in salaries. The 2018 report also showed that eight people who had forged documents were getting Sh318,500 per month and 856 others were earning Sh2.03 million in undeserved monthly allowances. During the headcount, 2,615 employees out of 3,345 were found to be legitimate workers. The two officers were speaking to the press in Migori town on Sunday morning.  (edited by o. owino)
