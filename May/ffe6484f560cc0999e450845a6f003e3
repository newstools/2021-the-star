Two-time National Police Service (NPS) Championships 5,000m champion Josephat Boit will use the NN World Teal Relay championships to boost his marathon career. Boit said the virtual relay race in which, runners form teams of four, will be an advantage not just for him but for the rest of the Global Sports Communication athletes who are preparing for the Olympics Games. Also in the mix will be Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge, former world half marathon record holder Geoffrey Kamworor, Noah Kipkemboi, Laban Korir, Jonathan Korir, Victor Chumo, and Daniel Kipchumba among other athletes based in Kaptagat. “The race will be great for us as athletes, especially marathoners. The event is a good platform to relaunch ourselves especially after many races were cancelled across the globe due to coronavirus,” said Boit. Boit will join the already existing teams, where each athlete will run a 10.5km relay race. “This is a race like any other and I want to most sincerely thank NN Running for their support,” added Boit, the two-time  NPS cross-country silver medalist. Boit, who made his marathon debut at the 2019 Rotterdam Marathon finishing 5th in 2:07.19, said he missed competing at the 2020 Seoul and Berlin after being canceled due to Covid-19. “I believe this is an opportunity to showcase my talent across the world,” added Boit, who was placed fifth in the 2019 New Delhi Half-Marathon.
