Murang'a SEAL head coach Vincent Nyaberi says he has taught his players the art of survival in the National Super League by completing the job in the first half in any match. Nyaberi said the tactic had proved successful in their 3-1 demolition of Nairobi Stima at Camp Toyoyo on Friday. “I thank God for the three points. I've struggled to ensure we survive the earlier relegation scare. “What I've come to learn about NSL us that a team is safer scoring early goals. It's better to you finish the job in the first half and defend the lead in the second half. “I learnt a very important lesson when we met Talanta in our last match. We were leading by two goals going to the break. When we came back for the second half, Talanta equalised all the goals and nailed it with a winner,” said Nyaberi. Stima tactician Barrack Ouma said he was disappointed they failed to capitalise on the home advantage, adding the early goals distabilised his team. “We had a good match and it's very bad to play reasonably well and then lose a match because of lapses and lack of concentration," said Ouma. “The quick successive goals distabilised us a bit. If we can learn to prevent such easy goals, we may be able to find our footing once again. “I'm very disappointed because I didn't expect things to take such a direction especially considering it was a home match," he said. Kiplangat John opened the floodgates for Murang'a SEAL in the 33rd minute, but Fortune Omoto leveled the terms for Stima on the stroke of halftime. Jairos Marcos doubled Seal's advantage in the 70th minute before John Omondi's stoppage time winner. In other matches, Kenya Police squandered an opportunity to ascend to the top of the log after crushing 2-1 to Modern Coast Rangers. Gusii beat Coast Stima 2-1 as Shabana's newly appointed tactician Robert Ojienda opened his account with a narrow 1-0 win over visiting Kibera Black Stars.
