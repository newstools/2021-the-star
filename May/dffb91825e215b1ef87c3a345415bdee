After a crocodile ate most of Gabriel Okoth, his family may be forced to buy just his leg. Members of the public searching the shore on Wednesday recovered a leg believed to have belonged to 25-year-old Gabriel Okoth from Kisumu. His friends said he was attacked on May 1 by a crocodile near Dunga Beach on Lake Victoria during a fishing expedition. His friends saw the reptile drag him away. Kisumu county police commander Samuel Anampiu said the search has been underway since May 1, involving divers and others. The leg was found on Wednesday evening. "Immediately we got the report of the recovery of the body part, scene of crime personnel and detectives from DCI based at Kisumu Central police station were dispatched to the beach," he said. The leg was taken to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital's mortuary in Kisumu. "We will carry out further analysis of the recovered leg to establish if it belonged to the deceased," he said. At the victim's Katuoro village in Nyalenda B ward, residents were in shock. Joseph Oduogo, 74, the father of the victim, said burial plans cannot proceed until other body parts are recovered. " We are still hoping  the remaining parts will be retrieved from the Lake so  we can organise to burry his remains. If we don't succeed, then we will decide as a family to bury the leg We will have no option," he said. Crocodile and hippo attack are common in the area. Many victims' families have petitioned the Kenya Wildlife Service to deal with rogue animals that endanger them and their crops. They also seek compensation from KWS. (Edited by V. Graham)
