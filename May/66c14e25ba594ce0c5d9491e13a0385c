President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to the family and friends of Public Service Commission chairman Stephen Kinyanjui Kirogo. Kirogo passed away on Friday at a Nairobi hospital. In his message to the family, President Kenyatta remembered the late Kirogo as a distinguished public servant who contributed immensely to the transformation of Kenya's public service by initiating critical reforms aimed at enhancing efficiency in service delivery. "It is sad that the cruel hand of death has robbed us of Mr Kirogo, a polished gentleman and refined administrator whose contribution to the transformation of our country's public sector shall be sorely missed," Uhuru said. "Mr Kirogo enjoyed a stellar career as an administrator in the public service spanning over thirty years. It is his long experience and strong administrative credentials that enabled him to steer our Public Service Commission on a trajectory of growth.” The President noted Kirogo's participation in the government's transformational programmes such as the Public Service Internship Programme. "The country will remember Mr Kirogo for very many good deeds. One of his outstanding achievements in recent years is the internship programme which continues to prop up careers of very many young Kenyans," he said. Prior to his appointment as Chairperson of the Public Service Commission, Kirogo served as the Principal Administrative Secretary/Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet in the Presidency and Cabinet Affairs Office since 2012. "As a country we shall always cherish Mr Kirogo's contribution to our nation's growth. I pray that God will comfort his family, relatives, friends, and indeed all Kenyans, at this trying moment,” the President said.
