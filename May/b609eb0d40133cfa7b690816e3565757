Road closure of the Nairobi bound traffic at Nyayo Stadium roundabout has been extended from May 31 at 9am to June 2 at 4pm, the Kenya National Highways Authority has said. Kenha Director General Peter Mundinia said that the extension is to allow sufficient time for the contractor to complete installation of culverts. "The contractor encountered a rock during the implementation of works thus delaying the initial programme," Mundinia said. Motorists have been advised to use alternative routes (Aerodrome Road, Baricho Road or Dunga Road). The authority has also said that it shall erect appropriate directional signs for effective traffic flow. "Kenha apologises for any inconveniences that may be caused at the authority endeavors to provide an efficient, safe and reliable road network," Mundinia said. The authority has also encouraged all motorists and pedestrians to observe safety measures implemented at the construction site. Kenha earlier stated that the traffic disruption being witnessed along the Mombasa Road all the way to James Gichuru Road, is being caused by the ongoing construction of the Nairobi Expressway project. The Nairobi Expressway which is a 27.1km highway starts from Mlolongo through Uhuru Highway and terminating at James Gichuru Road in Westlands. The project had earlier been estimated to take two years. The Expressway will have 10 interchanges atÂ  Mlolongo, SGR, JKIA, Eastern and Western bypasses, Capital Center, Haile Selassie, Museum Hill, Westlands and James Gichuru Roads. Transport CS James Macharia has maintained the project is on course to becoming a reality as key project milestones continue to be achieved.
