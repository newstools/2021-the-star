Women have been challenged to get out of their comfort zones and declare their interests in vying for various positions in the 2022 general elections. Kirinyaga Jubilee party chairman Muriithi Kang’ara noted that gender balance in leadership is crucial for any government that embraces sound and effective governance. He hailed Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu leadership style and praised her for her effort in reconciling her country with Kenya and other countries. “She is a perfect example of what sobriety leadership means. The diplomatic woes that existed between her nation and ours are rapidly fading thanks to her exemplary leadership,” Kang’ara said. “She is a leader of action and good character. Her administration and that of  President Uhuru Kenyatta agreed to work together for the well-being of the people of the two nations. They even agreed to open up the boundaries in order to enhance trade between the two countries.” He now is challenging women to go for the presidency as Kenya is equally ripe for a woman president. “Women are sober and their actions are as a result of rational reasoning. We have witnessed a lot of division under men’s leadership. I, therefore, call on women to rise to the occasion and believe in themselves. Their role in leadership could help in nation-building and unity.” Kang’ara also applauded the Judicial Service Commission for approving Martha Koome as the next Chief Justice. He said her long term experience in the judiciary unit will help her make informed decisions on how to lead the Judiciary. He urged women to look up to her for inspiration.
