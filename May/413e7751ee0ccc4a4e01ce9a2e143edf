Decimal Records signee Brian Nadra has released his debut album, 'Nadrenaline'. The event went down Friday night at the Social House and was attended by fellow label mates, fans and celebrities. Speaking about the album, Nadra said it is a buffet of genres. "I have sung in Kikuyu, in Sheng, in Lingala vibes... There's everything there for you, guys. It's all vibes." Adding, "In this album you wil see the investment in terms of how it sounds, the mastering, the mixing; generally, this is international quality." He thanked legendary producer Eric Musyoka for holding his hand in the music industry. The album has eight tracks and an all-around feel of urban pop music. "It's music for an urban generation of the smartphone era," he said.
