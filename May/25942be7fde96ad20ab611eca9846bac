The coronation of National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi as Mt Kenya region spokesperson is in vain, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has said. Speaking on KTN News, Thursday, Kuria insisted that anyone can afford elders to crown them. "This so called coronation of Muturi is nothing but vanity. It's an exercise in futility, it's like an opinion poll in China, accurate but of no value," Kuria said. He went on to say that he has no problem with the National Assembly Speaker and he can be coronated everywhere, but he still needs to know that he comes third after President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto. Kuria lauded Muturi as the the best Speaker any Kenyan Parliament has had since independence. "I am in that Parliament for the second term, Muturi is respected, very restrained and avoids making the kind of partisan rulings Marende and Kaparo were making before," he said. The coronation of  Muturi as the region’s spokesperson, has not augured well with some leaders in the Mt Kenya region. The speaker was coronated by some elders at Mukurwe wa Nyagathanga shrine in Murang’a county last Saturday. Some of the leaders opposed to the coronation and have distanced themselves from it include; Murang’a Governors Mwangi wa Iria, Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru), Anne Waiguru (Kirinyaga), and Mutahi Kahiga of Nyeri. Others are former Kiambu governor William Kabogo, former Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau, Dennis Waweru (BBI secretariat), and ex-Tetu MP Ndung'u Githinji. The leaders have insisted that they are a strong voting block, and they will soon make a major pronouncement on the way forward. Three Governors from Mt Kenya including Muthomi Njuki (Tharaka Nithi), Martin Wambora (Embu) and Kiraitu Murungi (Meru) have endorsed Muturi's coronation saying that he is a respectable leader in the region. -Edited by SKanyara
