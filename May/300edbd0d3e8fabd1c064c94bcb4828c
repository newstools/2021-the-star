Vihiga Queens received a major financial assurance from Vihiga County as they intensify preparations for the Cecafa Women's Championships set for July. The team needs a hefty Sh4million budget to feature in the prestigious event. Vihiga County Executive Committee Member for Youth, Gender, and Sports, Mrs. Felistus Okumu revealed they are assessing the priorities of the club in readiness for the regional championship. "Once the controller of budget clears the funds, we will not hesitate to release them to the team," she noted. “It’s part of our responsibility to support the team because they are our greatest ambassadors. At the moment, all counties are suffering due to lack of funds.  However, we remain hopeful something good will come up before the end of this month," she added. She added: "We will strive to do our best and support all our teams but remember it depends on the national government and the controller of budget. Once things are done the sports committee will sit with the management of the team and see how best they can give their support,” said Okumu The remarks follow concerns over the club's poor preparations due to lack of support from the county government. Okumu, however, urged the business fraternity and other well-wishers in western region to also support the girls who will be representing the country at the regional show. “With the quality we have, I feel we stand a better chance not only to win the championship but also progress to Morocco for Caf Championship. However, proper funding will be key,” Alumira pointed out.
