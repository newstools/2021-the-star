A 17-year old boy is among three people found in possession of assorted Kenya Defense Forces items including uniform and handcuffs. The boy and his 26-year old accomplice were arrested and held at the Mwariki Police Station while the third one escaped when police raided his house. Nakuru Town East Deputy Police Commander, Elena Kabukuru said the third person was being hunted down by a concerted team of police and the officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. She said the two suspects who have been operating using a civilian were on Saturday night arrested by police on night patrol. “One of them was wearing a KDF stock jacket while the other one had handcuffs during the arrest in Gatura area, the items were recovered and the motorbike impounded,” she said. Kabukuru said the third person escaped although police recovered more items in his car which has also been confiscated at the Mwariki Police Station. She said the police were holding the vehicle as part of evidence against the gang that has been harassing residents, stealing from them and impersonating police and the Kenya Defense Forces personnel. She said among the things recovered were KDF boots berets, smoke jackets, boots, sweaters so many others. She noted that one of the suspects had framed portrait of himself pictured in KDF uniform. “Police commenced investigations soon after the arrest which led to the recovery of more items that were stuffed in a car,” she said She added that the suspects were making false arrests, conducting fake raids and carting away people's properties and extortion by pretending they are police officers. The Two will be arraigned on Tuesday next week.
