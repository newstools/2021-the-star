Fast-rising poet Drew Gachagua has released a new project titled 'Late October'. This is a collection of 20 poems written by him and illustrated by Mekatilili Bantu. Speaking to Word Is, Drew said he wrote about identity, conformity, love, hate and youth. "Poetry has been there in my life. I started writing two years ago. I was going through a lot. I worked on this project for eight months," he said. "This book made me be my best self and without it, I wouldnâ€™t have survived. It is the essence of my adolescence." Taking to Twitter, Gachagua said poetry brought new meaning to his life. "I found something to be passionate about. I found poetry, and along the way, I found myself. And now, at 16, I am a published poet!"
