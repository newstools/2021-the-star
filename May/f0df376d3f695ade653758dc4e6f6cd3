The 36-year-old structural engineer and proprietor of Infinity Developers, based in Nairobi went missing after he left Miale Lounge in Lavington, Nairobi, where he had gone for a meeting and Idd celebrations on May 13. He had been in the company of yet-to-be-disclosed persons at 5pm before his car, a Range Rover with registration number KCQ 007P, was captured by CCTV cameras leaving the premises an hour later. In the footage, Bashir was seen tipping some guards. Part of the footage shows a few seconds after leaving his vehicle he stopped, his car seemingly obstructed by another vehicle. There has been speculation and many theories on what may have led to his death but no official confirmation has been made. After he failed to show up at his Lavington home for two days, his family reported a missing person incident to police. The family and friends tried to trace his whereabouts using a tracking device mounted on the car he had but in vain. His other lawyer Alibaya Hassan said the tracking vehicle company had installed the features in the car but they could not trace it. “But they said the systems could not trace the exact location of the motor vehicle. We don’t know why,” he said. Days later, a shell of a motor vehicle was spotted in Kibiku and a dealer who had been informed of the same alerted police. Police from Ngong rushed to the scene, saw the shell and went back to the station for a back for investigations. But when they came back few hours later they said they found the remains of the shell had been collected by unknown people. The photos show the car was burnt beyond recognition and it is not clear who was behind it or if there was an occupant.
