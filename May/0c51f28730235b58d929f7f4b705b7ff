It’s happened once again. It never really goes away. Each time, it takes a new look and Kenyans in their thousands get seduced by it. There is now weeping and gnashing of teeth as Kenyans count huge losses. Amazon Web Worker (AWW) has vanished with vast sums of money from Kenyans hoping for quick profits. The perpetrators of AWW did their homework: they took the name Amazon, the US tech giant famous for online shopping. AWW promised online jobs. They offered very attractive interest rates on cash deposits. AWW encouraged members to bring their friends with promises of getting a share of the recruits' joining fees. Last August, the Central Bank of Kenya warned that global online networking companies, pyramid schemes and forex traders would take advantage of Covid-19 economic difficulties to exploit Kenyans. Seems the warning was lost on many. There is not much data on how much Kenyans are losing to online fraudsters, but the global figure was estimated at 36 billion Euros (Sh4.6 trillion) in 2019, according to the Dutch-based E-commerce Foundation.
