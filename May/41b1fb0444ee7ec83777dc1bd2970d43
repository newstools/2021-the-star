Garissa Township MP Aden Duale on Saturday wished a couple well as he graced their Nikaah ceremony. It was the ceremony of Dr. Elyas Bishar Ahmed Rahma Ahmed Hassan at Bulla Tawakal, Garissa Town. The Nikah ceremony is the Muslim marriage ceremony. In the Islamic tradition, the marriage contract is signed during the Nikah and it's during this event that the bride and groom say, “I do.” Traditionally, the Nikah ceremony often takes place in a mosque and the leader or imam of the mosque officiates the Nikah. Dr. Elias is a medical doctor based at Thika level 5 hospital and former leader of Muslim students, Medical school, University of Nairobi. “May Allah bless you, your spouse and may he unite both of you in goodness,” Duale said during the ceremony. “ Allah, bless our marriage and let it be a means for us to become closer to You in love and devotion. Allah, let our marriage be a way for us and our families to enter Jannah. Allah, protect our marriage from the whispering of Shaytaan.” Duale asked God to give them the strength to live together in justice, equity, love and mercy. “Allah, let our marriage bring untold blessings to us individually, to our families and our children. Allah, bless us with healthy children who will be a source of great joy and happiness,” he said. “Allah, give us the love which you had blessed Muhammad (Sallalahu Alaihi Wassallam) with Khadija (R.A) Aameen Ya Rabb.”
