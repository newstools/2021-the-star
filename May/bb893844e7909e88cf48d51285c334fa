DP William Ruto on Saturday met leaders from Mt Kenya region to discuss how to re-engineer Kenya's economy. In an array of pictures shared online, Ruto said they are taking collaborative effort to promote enterprise and foster the empowerment of ordinary Kenyans. Ruto met with three representatives from each of the 11 counties from Mt Kenya region as a follow-up to the Maasai Mara meeting. "Through the ongoing consultations covering all regions and all sectors of the economy, we anticipate the generation of more jobs and expanded opportunities for those in the lower cadre will rid our country of poverty," Ruto said. Ruto said another session will be targeted for hustler representatives, MCAs, religious and business leaders. The second in command has pledged to implement to the letter the 'hustlers' economic blueprint to be unveiled in December. But in an interview with the Star, Ruto cut an image of a man determined to succeed Uhuru. He said he will not compromise on the implementation of his manifesto should he form government next year. The DP expressed confidence that his promise to change Kenya will come to pass, vowing to prove wrong his critics who have dismissed his promise to empower ordinary Kenyans through his bottom-up economic model as “big talk”. “I will work hard to implement every aspect of what I am pledging. The bottom-up economy will work and must work , this I can assure Kenyans and I will be accountable to them,” he told the Star at his Nairobi office. His critics have questioned why he cannot propose and implement the same development agenda now, yet he is the second in command in the Jubilee administration. However, Ruto, in an earlier interview with Citizen TV, blamed his frustrations on Uhuru's change of leadership style soon after they were sworn in for a second term.
