President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday united to pass the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the Senate. More than two-thirds - 51 of the 67 senators voted in favour of the bill with only 11 voting No. One senator abstained from the vote. A referendum is now nigh should the High Court allow IEBC to facilitate the process. The debate on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) bill, 2020 resumed in the senate on Tuesday morning ahead of the vote. The lawmakers took the vote on the bill after three weeks of debate characterised by calls to amend the document. Senate speaker Kenneth Lusaka also ruled out amending the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020. Lusaka said the Bill is a product of a popular initiative and thus parliament has not power to tinker with the document. "Parliament cannot replace or usurp public views with its own," Lusaka said. A host of senators were clamouring to amend the bill, with three officially wrote to the speaker recommending a raft of changes – creation and distribution of 70 additional constituencies being the elephant in the room. Senators Enoch Wambua (Kitui), Irungu Kangata (Murang’a) and Samson Cherargei (Nandi) sought the speaker’s nod to introduce the amendments.
