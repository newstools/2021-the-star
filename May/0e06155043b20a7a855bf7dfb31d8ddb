Comedian and content creator Erastus Ayieko, alias Flaqo, says his parents wanted him to be a neurosurgeon. Speaking on the Churchill Show 'Journey Series', Flaqo said his mother was initially against comedy. When he cleared high school, Flaqo joined Jaramogi Oginga University, where he was enrolled to pursue public health. His mother referred to his comedy as cartoons and told him to focus on studies. "Even when I moved to Nairobi, I remember I was a bit famous but very broke. I would tell her to help me even with Sh1,000 and she would call me and tell me, 'Go and look for a job, you have graduated from the university, stop doing your cartoon things and go get a job'." He said his mum is happy since he now sends her money.
