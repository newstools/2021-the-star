Tanzanian actress-cum-businesswoman Jacqueline Wolper is expecting her first child with stylist Rich Mitindo. Wolper is Harmonize's ex-girlfriend. Taking to social media, Wolper said she and her baby daddy had dated before but broke up and went their separate ways. Wolper said she is the one who wronged Mitindo before they broke up. "Maisha ya mahusiano ni kama safari yeyote ambayo unaweza kujuwa uko wapi kwa wakati huo lakini huwezi kujua hatua ijayo itakuwaje maana yote yanahitaji uwezo wa mungu. Tulianza kuibana 2016. Nikamkosea sana tukaachana lakini ukuwahi nichukia." She added that after the breakup, they still were business friends. They later met in 2020 while both were single and they started a relationship. Wolper dumped Harmonize for having a relationship with Sarah behind her back.
