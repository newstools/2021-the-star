Three suspects armed with machetes, were arrested on Sunday as they prepared to stage attacks against motorists along the southern bypass. Brian Mwangi and Nickson Muchiri aged 25, were arrested following a well executed operation, mounted by Langata based Police Officers. DCI boss George Kinoti said on Monday that a third suspect aged 15, was arrested as he fled to the nearby Ngong forest, in a bid to evade arrest. "Two motorbikes used by the criminals as their getaway means were also impounded, in the meticulous operation staged by the officers," Kinoti said. The suspects will be arraigned in court today to answer to charges of preparing to commit a felony. Their arrest follows a spate of attacks that have been staged against motorists, along the busy highway. Last week, six other suspects were flushed out of the forest in a similar operation, after they attacked a motorist and his three-year-old son. Officers conducted an operation following a report by a motorist who was attacked and violently robbed. He told police he was attacked after the stopped to let his son answer a call of nature. They were travelling from Nakuru to Nairobi when they were accosted by thugs a few metres past the virtual weigh bridge late at night.
