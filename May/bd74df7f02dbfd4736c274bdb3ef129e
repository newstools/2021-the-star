A Kitengela woman who was attacked by nine dogs near her home in the Nkurrunka area of Kajiado on Friday has succumbed to her injuries. Elizabeth Nthenya, whose arm was amputated on arrival at Kenyatta National Hospital on Friday night, died on Sunday night in the ICU. Doctors and family members said she lost a lot of blood after the attack. The dogs attacked her as she walked to her home in Nkurrunka from the market. The injured woman was later taken to KNH by her neighbour, Wilson Kisemei. On Monday Kisemei described Nthenya as “humble and hard-working”. “We are mourning our neighbour, a respected woman in society who loved all her neighbours. What happened is an unfortunate thing,” he said. Soon after the attack, neighbours killed four dogs as five disappeared under the cover of darkness. Nthenya’s neighbours have urged the police in Nkurrunka to hunt down and kill the remaining five dogs. Edited by A.N
