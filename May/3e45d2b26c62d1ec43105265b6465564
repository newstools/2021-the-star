Competition Authority of Kenya has said that some bread manufacturers are not meeting the provisions of the Competitions Act and other relevant standards. In a statement on Monday, CAK said that it finalised investigations that were targeting bread manufacturers in the country as per its consumer protection mandate. The authority said that some of the manufacturers were not providing the manufacturing date/month on their bread wrappers in the prescribed format while others were printing them illegally on the seals. “The manufactures failed to provide the weight of their bread products and ingredients, while others marketed their bread as fortified but did not specify the alleged nutrients/vitamins used,” CAK said in a statement. It said that some manufacturers misled their consumers that their products contained milk or butter whereas they did not. Further, the authority said that the manufacturers were not adhering to products information standards as prescribed by the Kenya Bureau of Standards, which is contrary to Section 60 (1) of the Competition Act. To ensure compliance with the order, the authority has directed all the bread manufacturers to adhere to the set standards with immediate effect. Some of the remedial orders issued by the authority to bread manufacturers include; to ensure compliance with sections 55(a) (i) and 60 (1) of the Competition Act, to ensure compliance with the requirements of the KS EAS 38:2014 and KS EAS 43:2012 Standards, including providing a list of ingredients and the net weight of their products in grams. Other orders are to legibly print the day and month the product was manufactured on the wrapper; correctly indicate the expiry date of the bread by adjusting the information on the wrappers to ‘Best Before’ as opposed to ‘Sell By’ as well as clearly specify the vitamins and the minerals used in fortification of the bread.
