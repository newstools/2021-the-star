Former Kwale county IEBC deputy election manager who was arraigned on Friday before the anti-corruption court in Mombasa to answer forgery charges has been released on Sh300,000 cash bail. Saidi Mtili Kajambo, who refuted the claims was arrested on Thursday by the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission officers. Kajambo is accused of faking KRA certificate documents and other legal papers following an awarded tender. According to a statement by the EACC, Kajambo is accused of fraudulent acquiring of public property, fraudulent practice in procurement proceedings, conflict of interest, forgery and uttering false documents. The offences were committed in 2017. It is said during the 2017 general election in Kinango constituency Kajambo was given a tender No. IEBC/58/2016-2017-Provision of transport Services worth Sh14,893,857.76 through a company M/s One World Transporters where he is a director. It was later alleged that the company had forged a KRA Tax Compliance Certificate and a copy of a Local Service Order as proof of services previously rendered. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions later approved his prosecution after thorough investigations and recommendations to charge the officer. His arrest comes weeks after a clearing agent was arrested by KRA officers at the Lunga Lunga one-stop border point. He was charged with falsifying tax payment documents and using fake papers to evade taxes but he was later released on Sh70,000 bond or Sh40,000 cash bail.
