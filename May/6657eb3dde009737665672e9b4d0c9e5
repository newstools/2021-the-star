The suspect in NLC officer Jennifer Wambua's murder will take a second mental test after the first one indicated he was not fit to stand trial. Peter Mwangi Njenga, alias Sankale, did not take a plea on Tuesday before Machakos High Court judge David Kemei on grounds he was mentally unstable. The court ordered Njenga receive a second psychiatric assessment on June 14 before taking a plea. The suspect's pro bono lawyer Dorine Mwau said, "The mental assessment of my client shows he is mentally unstable. A second mental assessment has been booked and the accused is under medication," she said. "The doctor’s report indicates  he isn’t fit for prosecution." Justice Kemei ordered the matter be mentioned on June 22 at Kajiado High Court to consider the psychiatric review. Njenga will be returned to Muthaiga police station where he has since been held until June 22. Njenga was arraigned on May 17 before Kemei on a murder charge. The charge sheet says between March 12 and 13, Njenga murdered Wambua with others not before the court. She was killed at veterinary farm Ebulbul in Kajiado North. She was sexually assaulted and strangled after she prayed at a pilgrimage site in a forest. Her pastor had advised her to pray. DCI director George Kinoti said homicide detectives made the arrest through a forensic investigation that involved Njenga's sister and placed him at the scene. "They established eyewitnesses who saw the suspect with the deceased the last time she was seen alive on March 12," Kinoti said. Detectives repeatedly combed the scene of the crime for evidence. "The forensic results are finally out, positively matching the suspect," Kinoti said. "Detectives established the suspect had interacted and spent quite some time with the deceased at the location where the body was later discovered.," Kinoti said. (Edited by V. Graham)
