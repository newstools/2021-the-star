IF Elfsborg and Kenyan international defender Joseph Okumu has been ruled out of action for at least two weeks after picking up an injury in a league match against AIK in the Swedish top tier. The 23-year-old centre-back limped off the encounter in the 84th minute as Elfsborg went on to crush 1-0 in their away league match against AIK on May 2. Team doctor Matilda Lundblad provided an update on the club’s official website, saying Okumu and Rasmus Alm both had to leave the field during Sunday's match. “Joseph Okumu has a small injury in the membrane around the calf muscle. He is expected to be partially available for games in just over two weeks,” said Lundblad. “Rasmus Alm did an MRI examination yesterday which showed muscle strain in the back of the thigh. Return to full play is estimated to take about three weeks after the injury,” she added. “We wish Rasmus and Joseph a speedy recovery and look forward to seeing them both on the pitch again.” With just over one year left on his three-year contract that expires on July 15, 2022, Okumu is said to be looking at offers from Scottish champions Rangers, Serie 'A' side Napoli, and Spanish side Valencia. According to reports, the Kakamega High School alumnus who signed up for Elfsborg in 2019 after a stint with American side Real Monarchs has placed an Sh300 million tag on his signature.
