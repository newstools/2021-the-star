President Uhuru Kenyatta has been urged to crack the whip and punish lawmakers, especially from Mt Kenya who rebelled against the party's stand on the BBI Bill. National Assembly deputy Minority whip Maoka Maore said the nay vote on the BBI was an act of defiance. “It is incumbent on President Kenyatta to crack the whip on his troops who seem to be wandering, cheap and petty to ensure he brings in discipline,” the Igembe North MP said. Several MPs from Embu, Tharaka Nithi and five of the 11 Meru lawmakers voted against the bill. “The MPs who voted against the president’s project should ask people on the ground whether they would have survived without hanging on Uhuru’s coat,” he said. At least 320 members participated in the vote at the second stage where 235 supported the Bill, 83 vited no while two abstained. Most allies of Deputy President William Ruto rejected the Bill during the vote that followed the political alignments in the country. Some voted in support. During voting in the third reading, the Ayes were 224, Nays 63, while two abstained. At least 17 MPs from Mt Kenya opposed the Bill among them Mathira’s Rigathi Gachagua, Nyandarua Woman Rep Faith Gitau, Ndia MP George Macharia, Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wah, Cecily Mbarire (Nominated), Mugambi Rindikiri (Buuri) and Jeffrey King'ang'i (Mbeere South). Others were Manyatta MP John Mutunga, Moses Kirima (Imenti Central), John Paul Mwirigi (Igembe South), Patrick Munene (Chuka Igambang’ombe), Moses Kuria (Gatundu South). Purity Wangui (Kirinyaga Woman Rep), Tharaka Nithi Woman MP Beatrice Nkatha, Kiharu’s Ndindi Nyoro, Nyeri Woman MP Rahab Mukami and Kandara’s Alice Wahome also rejected it.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
