The Anti-Corruption arm of the High Court has ordered Nakuru West MP Samuel Arama, who was acquitted of graft charges in 2019, to be placed on his defence. The trial court had acquitted Arama and two others, saying they had no case to answer but Justice James Wakiaga on Wednesday said they should be put on their defence. The DPP had appealed the ruling by Magistrate Kombo after being dissatisfied with the decision to acquit the accused. Justice Wakiaga has allowed the appeal and ordered that the accused be placed on his defence, ruling that the burden of proof by the DPP is on a balance of probability and not reasonable doubt. The other reason that Arama has been put on defence by the judge is because the property he was charged in relation to is registered in his name and the court says he ought to have been placed on defence to explain. The case will be mentioned before chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti on June 15 for allocation of a new court to hear the defence. In the case, Arama is alleged to have conspired with four others to defraud Ahmed Muhammad Nisar by means of dispossessing him of a plot between August 3, 2015 and August 11, 2015.
