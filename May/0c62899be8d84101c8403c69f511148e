The Garissa County Referral Hospital on Wednesday received a donation of PPE worth Sh3 million from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The items consisting of 1,852 boxes of face masks, 1,122 boxes of face shields and seven boxes of gowns were received by Garissa’s Medical Superintendent Dr Ambrose Misore. LSTM programme officer Onesmus Maina said the donation was meant to support health workers in the fight against Covid-19. He spoke on Wednesday while handing over the PPE. “We are committed to supporting communities with medical supplies to fight Covid-19. We will continue to partner with the county government to support health workers in reproductive health. We have also sent deliveries of similar equipment to subcounty hospitals in Modogashe, Dadaab, Balambala and Ijara,” Maina said. “LSTM will further replace learning materials for nurses and midwives for maternal health programmes in Garissa county which were razed down by fire in 2015.” Misore said the programme has so far supported the training of 400 health workers in Garissa county in the reproductive health sector. Health executive Roble Nunow thanked LSTM team for their continued support in various programmes and called for the strengthening of the partnership in the future. Edited by A.N
