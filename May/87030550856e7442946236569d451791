It is going to be a major duel and show of might in Rurii Ward in Nyandarua as the ruling parties Jubilee and Deputy President William Ruto’s United Democratic Party, battle it out in the Tuesday by-election. Leaders from the two rivaling parties camped in the ward this weekend in a last minute rush to woo voters to vote their respective candidates in what is being termed as a two horse race between Jubilee’s Peter Thinji and UDA’s Francis Muraya. The seat fell vacant in January following the death of area County Representative John Mburu popularly referred to as Wamaria after a long battle with cancer. Wamaria’s personal Assistant, Isaac Nderi, who is vying on a Maendeleo Chap Chap ticket, is among several other candidates seeking to fill the gap. The others are Susan Wangeci Wamunga of The New Democrats (TND), Peter Gathika of Democratic Party (DP) and Gabriel Gitome (independent). The two major contenders have chosen different strategies amid COVID-19 prevention measures that have barred political gathering. Most of them are going door to door and addressing small groups at trading center with police being on high alert to ensure COVID-19 prevention protocols are not broken. The UDA squad who include MPs Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu) and Jane Kihara (Naivasha) have camped in Ol Kalou together with their host, Nyandarua Woman Representative, Faith Gitau to campaign for Muraya. “Police are more interested with what UDA is doing and following us around with the aim of intimidating our supporters,” Rigathi claimed. On the other hand, Jubilee representatives on the ground who include Governor Francis Kimemia and Ol Kalou MP David Kiaraho have decided to campaign individually. Kimemia has also invited his Laikipia counterpart, Ndiritu Muriithi to campaign for Thinji. During their campaigns, the two have also been donating foodstuff and blankets to residents of different villages in the ward including Acre, Lower Muran, Ebenezer and Kirathimo.
