Newly elected KTDA directors will take office in the next two weeks. Agriculture CS Peter Munya on Thursday asked his Interior counterpart to provide security for the new directors as they start their role. Munya said there has been resistance towards the elected officials by factory unit managers. "We request security agencies to help ensure easy transition," said the CS. He told former tea factory directors to keep off from the tea premises and from engaging in sector issues. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i assured the elected officers that the government will provide the necessary security to ensure reforms happen. "These reforms will happen and we will stay on course until the farmer benefits. Those going to court can go ahead but the Government will come and explain. Tea does not belong to KTDA but to farmers," said Matiang'i. He directed County Commissioners to supervise and ensure the directors' take over is smooth and with no hitches. "Ensure you assist new directors to take over office immediately and throw out whoever needs to be thrown out within the next two weeks," he said.
