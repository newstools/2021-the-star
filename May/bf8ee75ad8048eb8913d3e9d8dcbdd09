President Uhuru Kenyatta has broke his silence over BBI since a five-judge High Court bench scuttled the process. The president said he is confident that they will overcome the BBI setback saying the drive is about securing future of Kenyans. Speaking at Wagai market in Gem Constituency, Siaya, Uhuru added that his handshake with Raila Odinga is a long-term engagement that will go into the future. The President, who is on a tour of Nyanza ahead of the Madakara day celebrations, rallied the residents to back BBI. "BBI is not helping Raila and his family. BBI is not helping Uhuru. It is for bringing justice for every Kenyan. And that is what I am pleading with you, please come out and support it," he said. "What is before us we will sort out, I am sure. If we have lawyers like Orengo, can we be defeated really?" he posed. Uhuru  and Raila are set for major fightback to salvage BBI through a legal battle involving the crème de la crème of constitutional lawyers. The eight lawyers range from celebrated constitutional legal titans to avid trial experts, tipping the Court of Appeal for a major showdown against anti-building Bridges Initiative forces. The Star established that while the BBI team and the IEBC lawyers are pursuing different appeals, a big meeting bringing together all the lawyers was held sometime this week. The BBI and IEBC legal team attacks would be a multi-pronged duel at the Court of Appeal to not only salvage BBI but also to rescue the electoral commission. This even as it emerged that acting Court of Appeal President Daniel Musinga is expected to constitute a bench to hear and determine the appeals once formally filed at the court. Uhuru and Raila are said to have brought together leading legal minds in constitutional law including Siaya Senator James Orengo and Rarieda MP Otiende Amolo as part of the BBI counsel
