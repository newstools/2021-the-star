A Nairobi court has released the passports of Garissa Governor Ali Korane to enable him to travel to Saudi Arabia for religious engagements. Korane, who faces Sh233 million graft charges, holds citizen and diplomatic passports. Anti-corruption court chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti directed that the documents be deposited back in court on May 17 upon the return of the governor. “Since there is no objection by the prosecution, I direct that his two passports be released to him immediately to allow him travel abroad as may be necessary but he should deposit the same back to court on May 17,” the magistrate ruled. The court ordered the governor to deposit his passports in court as part of his bail terms after he was charged with graft in September 2020. Through his lawyers Ahmednasir Abdullahi and Issa Mansur, Korane urged the court to allow him to travel to the Saudi Arabia for 10 days from May 5 to 15, 2021 for religious purposes during this time of Ramadhan. Korane is charged alongside four county officials Ibrahim Malow Nur, Mohamed Ahmed Abdullahi, Abdi Shale and Ahmed Abdullahi Aden with eight counts of conspiracy to commit an economic crime, failure to comply with procurement law relating to management of public funds and misappropriation of public funds. The four are accused of conspiring to commit an economic crime, namely, mismanagement of public funds allocated to the county government of Garissa as a conditional grant for the Kenya Urban Support Programme amounting to Sh233,506,000. Korane was barred from accessing his offices until the corruption case against him is heard and determined. Edited by Henry Makori
