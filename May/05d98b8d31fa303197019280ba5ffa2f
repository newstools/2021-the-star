Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has said his party - PEP - has decided to withdraw from the Kiambaa by-election race. Kuria said that the decision was made after consultations with Deputy President William Ruto. The People's Empowerment Party was fielding Raymond Kuria as its candidate. However, this drew criticism from other Ruto supporters in what was seen as sibling rivalry. "Yesterday I held extensive discussions with my boss and friend William Ruto on this matter. To make my two colleagues happy and above all for the unity of the Hustler Nation, PEP will NOT be fielding a candidate for the Kiambaa by-election," Kuria said. UDA is also fielding a candidate in the Kiambaa polls and the party is seen as the DP's vehicle in the 2022 presidential race. PEP was hoping to extend its popularity in the region after its candidate secured the Juja constituency seat in the concluded by-election. Kuria has offered his apologies to Raymond Kuria who was to be the party's candidate, the people of Kiambaa, and all PEP members who might be disappointed with the decision. The MP has said that the party will now focus on a nationwide tour to meet candidates who will be vying for various seats in next year's general elections on the PEP ticket. George Koimburi was declared the winner after garnering 12,159 votes against Jubilee's Susan Njeri who got 5,746 votes. Koimburi contested against former MP Francis Munyua Waititu alias Wakapee in the 2017 general elections but lost to the late lawmaker.
