National Assembly Majority leader, Amos Kimunya now says by-elections cannot be used to measure the popularity of political parties. Speaking to Radio Citizen on Wednesday, Kimunya insisted that the recent by-elections in Bonchari and Rurii cannot be used to measure the same. "Bonchari is an ODM stronghold, Rurii is a Jubilee zone and there were two jubilee teams in Rurii," Kimunya said. His statement comes despite his vowing to resign if Jubilee did not win in the Rurii Ward by-election which is in his Nyandarua county backyard. It is not the first time the lawmaker has thrown the 'resign' line loosely. Kimunya once said that he would rather die than resign when he was Finance minister in then President Mwai Kibaki's administration. Meanwhile, the Kipipiri MP said it was a mistake for Jubilee to field a candidate in Bonchari as ODM voters turned out in large numbers and they clinched the seat. Kimunya also talked about the "failures" of Jubilee saying that courtesy of being the ruling party, all failures must be directed at it. "When you are a ruling party you are blamed for all problems like Covid-19 and the economy doing badly," Kimunya said. Kimunya addressed the issue of Jubilee members supporting candidates from other parties insisting that their hearts are in Jubilee, despite their actions. He added that some of them are "confused" and chasing them away from the party is not is not the solution. Kimunya said that the wrangles within Jubilee came about because of the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga, as well as 2022 politics, where some members of the party felt shortchanged.
