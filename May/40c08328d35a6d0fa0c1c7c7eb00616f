Kisii Governor James Ongwae says the Lake Region Economic Bloc is targeting to export fresh produce to the UK market. Ongwae said LREB is at advanced stages to have direct export of fresh produce from the region, including bananas and vegetables. Kenya Airways has already indicated commitment to provide cargo freight services. Speaking after holding a meeting with British Deputy High Commissioner Julius Court and British Defence Advisor Brigadier Ronnie Westerman, Ongwae thanked the UK for the ongoing  development partnerships with most counties. The vice chair of the Council of Governors said the meeting was part of continuous engagement that had spanned years since the advent of devolution. Kisii county has received support for the construction of the Covid-19 compliant market at Daraja Mbili, which is now complete and will be opened soon. As part of supporting LREB, the governor appealed to the UK government to support a bill currently in the Senate that is meant to give the regional blocs identity so as to benefit from the joint ventures. The governor also praised Kenya-UK cooperation more so on human resource development especially in the health sector and appreciated the progress made so far following his visit to UK and the signing of an MoU by President Uhuru Kenyatta last year. Kisii University and Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital are likely to benefit from the training arrangements and exchange programme with UK institutions. Ambassador Court promised the unwavering UK support to the counties.
