Kenya Rugby Union is formulating a policy framework to ensure local players (both current and former International) are subjected to insurance benefits and pension schemes. KRU chairman Oduor Gangla yesterday said there is need to provide rugby players, especially those in the national teams with a welfare fund and insurance cover. “We at KRU together with our partners, are doing our best to put proper structures in place towards implementing a program that will entail provision of insurance policies and pension schemes to our current and retired players. It’s good for the sport considering the sacrifice involved,” noted Gangla. He said they hope to have the framework ready in the next couple of months. “It's something which is being worked on and we hope it will be a game changer for our players as we seek to ensure players have something to fall back on when they retire from the game,” added Gangla. The move by KRU has been necessitated by the experience of the former  Kenya 7s head coach, Benjamin Ayimba, who was forced to rely on contributions from friends and well wishers to cater for his accrued medical bill. Ayimba passed away last Friday at at Nairobi hospital after a bout of cerebral malaria . The former Kenya Sevens, Simbas, and Impala skipper had stellar playing and coaching career. He captained Impala to three Kenya Cup and Enterprise Cup titles between 2000 and 2002 as well three national sevens titles between 1999-2001 He featured for Kenya Sevens at the Commonwealth Games in 1998, 2002 and 2006 and coached Shujaa to their 2009 World Cup semis. He also coached the side to their first-ever World Series trophy after beating Fiji 30-7 in Singapore in 2016.
