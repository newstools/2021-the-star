Tiaty MP, Williama Kamket has said that the Building Bridges Initiative judgment by the five-judge bench was wrong and it must be overturned. Speaking on Monday when he appeared on Citizen TV, the MP insisted that the ruling must be overturned by all means necessary. "You cannot tell us that you cannot change the Constitution, it belongs to the people. It doesn’t belong to the courts and was a dangerous judgement," Kamket said. He went on to say that the five judges were conflicted, as he blamed the Attorney General for failing to do his job. Kamket noted that some issues should have been avoided from the beginning, starting with the appointment of the five-judges. In a landmark ruling, the High Court bench led by Justice Joel Ngugi quashed the BBI process, terming the constitutional amendment process illegal, null and void. The judges also ruled that the IEBC lacked quorum as stipulated in the law for purposes of carrying out referendum preparations, including verification of signatures. The bench issued a permanent injunction restraining IEBC from conducting the referendum. IEBC announced that it will appeal the ruling stopping it from conducting a referendum due to lack of quorum. "As a commission we have engaged our lawyers and discussions are ongoing... in the course of this week, we shall be lodging an appeal in the Court of Appeal and it’s for the simple reason, sometime in 2018, the High Court presided by Justice Okwany made a determination that article 250 of the Constitution is what applies to the Commission," Chebukati said. President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are said to have brought together leading legal minds in constitutional law including Siaya Senator James Orengo and Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo as part of the BBI counsel.
