Taita Taveta MCAs have criticised executives' prolonged Covid-19 leave since April 29, saying their absence has left a vacuum in administration. The county is working on the 2021-22 budget. Nominated MCA Frank Mmare asked chairman of the committee on administration to explain why the executives had not resumed their duties. County secretary Liverson Mghendi had asked the CECs and their drivers to proceed on leave from April 29, citing increasing Covid-19 cases. They were directed to park their vehicles outside the governor’s office in Mwatate and give the keys to the county secretary. “The order to send all county ministers on annual leave compromises service delivery to the citizens, especially now that we are in a budget cycle,” Mmare said. Mmare wants the public to be told whether the CECs are receiving their salaries, house allowances and any other payment while on leave. “Residents need to know exactly what informed the decision to send the CECs on annual leave and who was involved in making the decision. When is the indefinite leave expected to end and what is the fate of the drivers?" he asked. The MCA cited violation of the County Governments Act, 2012, by allowing all the ministers to proceed on leave at the same time, leaving a void in operations. He said the budget process might be delayed further should the executives fail to resume duties soon. “The executive is mandated to supervise the administration and delivery of services in the county and all decentralised units and agencies,” he said. Efforts to reach county spokesperson Denis Onsarigo were unsuccessful. For the past two months, the county has announced a major scaling-down of operations in line with the national and county governments’ directives on containing the spread of Covid-19. Earlier, Onsarigo had said that the county will continue offering essential and critical services and that scaling back would not affect daily operations. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
