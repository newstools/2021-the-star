Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has called out those wishing him bad, in another of his morning prayers. Sonko said that he will never get tired of praying and thanking God for keeping him and his followers safe during these difficult times. The former governor mentioned that Godâ€™s protection has had his enemies upset because he is not suffering as they expected him. "I pray that You continue to bless and protect us always. We know very well not all storms come to destroy us, some come to clear our path no wonder some people are mad at us because we are not suffering the way they expected us to. Lord May, you keep on disappointing them. We are in your hands," said Sonko. Since his ouster as Nairobi Governor, Sonko has been sharing life experiences with his followers on social media and engaging in charity. He also refers to himself as a blogger and has been occasionally sharing prayers with his followers on social media. Sonko was impeached by the Senate on Thursday, December 17, 2020, after a majority of the senators voted to uphold the four charges levelled against him by city MCAs. Some 27 legislators voted in favour of each of the charge, surpassing the Constitutional threshold of 24 votes needed to remove the governor from office. Sixteen senators voted against the charges with two senators Mutula Kilonzo Jr and Johnson Sakaja abstained. Mike Sonko was accused of gross violation of the constitution, abuse of office, gross misconduct and crimes under national law.
