President Uhuru Kenyatta has officially commissioned the Kenya Meat Commission. Uhuru who arrived in his convoy on Monday was received by Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua. The President toured the depot before proceeding to Kenya Meat Commission Factory in Athi River, Machakos County. By March last year, KMC had accrued debts totalling to Sh1.1 billion, with farmers’ debt standing at Sh254.4 million and outstanding payroll deductions at Sh144 million. Eight months  ago, Uhuru transferred the commission to the Ministry of Defence through an Executive Order. The relocation of the Kenya Meat Commission to the Kenya Defence Forces, raised many questions. The government claimed that military-run outfits are generally more efficient. This was after a section of Nairobi was left in the hands of general Mohammed Badi of the military to run. The President created the Nairobi Metropolitan Services headed by Major General  Badi to offer services to residents of Nairobi County. The government also claimed that procurement processes under the military are more transparent, less constrained and consequently faster. By March 2018, KMC accrued debts totalling to Sh1.1 billion, with farmers’ debt standing at Sh254.4 million and outstanding payroll deductions at Sh144 million. According to the conversation, there will still be challenges ahead, even after the Commission’s transfer. It notes that for the Commission to be commercially viable, there needs to be an overhaul and restructuring plan. "The buyer of last resort function is an inherent public responsibility and must be detached from it or the government takes it on as a component of the strategic food reserve," it notes.
