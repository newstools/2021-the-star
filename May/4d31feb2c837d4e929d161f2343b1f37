Defence Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma has said claims that the government has 'militarised' the Kenya Meat Commission are misguided. Speaking on Citizen TV Thursday, the CS said it is an agenda that is being driven by people who benefited the most, from what everyone thought was a dying KMC. Juma insisted that three-quarters of workers at the commission which was recently re-launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta are civilians. "All staff at KMC when we took over are there and what we said to them is that they have to understand the vision we are bringing or leave," Juma said. A section of Kenyans raised questions after Uhuru transferred KMC to the Ministry of Defense, from the Ministry of Agriculture, through an Executive Order, about eight months ago. KDF was mandated with the task of restoring infrastructure and develop an ambitious business plan for the commission but the move was opposed by the Senate, saying that there was no public participation undertaken before the decision was arrived at. The Law Society of Kenya also moved to court challenging the restructuring of the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) and the court stopped the transfer on February 2021, citing violation of Article 10 of the Constitution. "The claim that the decision to reassign the ministerial responsibility from the Ministry of Agriculture to Defence is in violation of Article 10 of the Constitution for want of public participation succeeds. This court declares the said decision constitutionally infirm. The decision is hereby quashed," Judge Mrima said. However, on May 24, 2021, President Uhuru Kenyatta officially launched the refurbished Kenya Meat Commission and handed it over to the KDF. By March last year, KMC had accrued debts totalling Sh1.1 billion, with farmers’ debt standing at Sh254.4 million and outstanding payroll deductions at Sh144 million.
