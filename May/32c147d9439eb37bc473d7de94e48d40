FlightSafety International Dash 8-400 simulator is now operational in Kenya. The stimulator is being housed at Kenya Airways Pride Center and will have Jambojet as the anchor user. According to Jambojet communications on Thursday, the simulator, which is the third in Africa will support high-quality pilot and maintenance crew training. It is a culmination of a 2019 tripartite agreement between Jambojet, Kenya Airways, and FlightSafety International (FSI). Speaking during a media experience of the Dash 8-400 simulator, Jambojet Acting Managing Director, Karanja Ndegwa noted that having the simulator closer to operations will improve efficiencies and reduce Jambojet’s operating costs by at least 10 per cent. "Operational excellence is one of our key pillars at Jambojet. Having the simulator here ensures our pilots do not have to travel outside the continent for training every six months, therefore maintaining our reliability, efficiency and safety standards," Ndegwa said. "FlightSafety is pleased to be working with Kenya Airways and Jambojet to put in service additional flight simulators for the De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400 aircraft,” Brad Thress CEO said. The simulator which includes instructor-led courses is installed at the Kenya Airways Pride Centre in Nairobi and qualified by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the civil aviation authorities in Kenya. “Having local access to the simulators will help to increase proficiency by enabling pilots to train more often, reduce overall training costs, and ensure the airlines have the most prepared and proficient aviators,” Brad Thress CEO said. Jambojet currently flies to six local destinations including Mombasa, Eldoret, Kisumu, Malindi, and Ukunda (Diani) from its hub in Nairobi.
