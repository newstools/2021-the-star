Content creator Maureen Waititu says she is ready to love again after her marriage with fitness guru Frankie failed. Speaking in a TV interview, the mother of two said the breaking up with her ex Frankie drained her emotionally. "I still believe in love, I have a lot to offer. My heart was broken but I am filled with love now. I would be interested in a man who has certain values that I'm looking for. I pray to God to bring me a man who is God-fearing," she said. Looking back, she said, "People laughed at me, telling me to move on. Where do I go to? Currently, I am happy. My heart is settled. "I regret that there was a lack of respect all through the process. But on my side, I really tried. The more I kept quiet, the more I became hurt."
