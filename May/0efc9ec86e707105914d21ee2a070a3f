“Just because you are the dog at the King’s Palace shouldn’t make you think you’re the king,” a woman at the reception ranted at Mrs Kiragu. Mrs Kiragu was the principal’s secretary, a woman we all loathed. Wholeheartedly so. For one, she looked very unfriendly. She was rude, conceited and felt as though she owned the school. It was my first time to ever meet her. In my four years of being in high school, our paths never crossed. There’s the saying, “Never approach a donkey from the back, a bull from the front or a halfwit from any direction.” I had heeded to it. On this day, I had gone for my clearance certificate, so I had to meet her. As I arrived at her office, I met a woman ranting at her. Not knowing what was going on, I stepped back a little bit. “What do you want? Or are you here to eavesdrop our conversation?” she asked me. Before I could get my words, I was sent away for ‘loitering’ within the school premises. “Don’t go!” the woman she was arguing with interjected. I hesitated, fully aware of Mrs Kiragu’s vile. But she insisted I stay. After a few calls, the principal personally came to usher in the woman. As it would turn out, she was an official in the ministry. What followed was Mrs Kiragu’s suspension and an eventual dismissal. Many other secretaries are like Mrs Kiragu. They’re always in a foul mood and ready to disparage anyone who comes their way. Quite often, we have to kiss their boots because we desperately need help. May they face a similar fate as Mrs Kiragu. In a world where you can be anything, be kind.
