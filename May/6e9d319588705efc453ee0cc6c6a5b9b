Chief Justice Martha Koome has said her appointment inspires every boy and girl to keep dreaming no matter where they come from. Speaking when she assumed office on Monday, the CJ acknowledged her mother and women in whose footsteps she has walked, such as Priscilla Ambwao, who represented Kenya at Lancaster house and the first female magistrate Effie Owuor among others. Koome called her work a calling, saying she juggled roles of being a young mother and law student. She said no one should be permitted to tilt the scales of justice. Koome said she will prioritise building an innovative institution. She noted the Judiciary is still grappling with a high number of case backlog, saying it was unacceptable. Koome said she will encourage use of technology, adding that many people still travel long distances to access justice making far reaching sacrifices such as sometimes selling their only possessions. She asked courts to be aware of this. "The Judiciary fund is yet to be operationalised, but we will continue to build our case for additional allocation of funds," she said. Retired CJ David Maraga had said the Judiciary is under capture. "This continues to be an active threat to the independence of the Judiciary," Koome said. "We should strive to be fair in administration of justice. We should guard the independence of the Judiciary." "The challenge of threat to independence of the Judiciary is an old one. Judicial independence is anchored in the Constitution. It behooves judges to resist any interference. The law requires us to decide cases on law and not interference of any party." Koome also acknowledged that the Judiciary cannot succeed alone without working with other arms of government. "Let us conclude this matter is the attitude I will bring. If there cases to be heard let us conclude, if there are differences let us conclude them."
