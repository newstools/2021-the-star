KRA has destroyed illicit excisable products with a market value of Sh1 billion at Stoni Athi, Kajiado county. The products seized from various traders in Nairobi and its environs, were being sold in contravention of the Excise Duty Act and various regulations and would have resulted to a loss of taxes worth over Sh 400 million. Among the products destroyed were 379,760 bottles of spirits, 60 drums of raw spirit, 35,615 bottles of beer, 11,000 bottles of wine and 197,000 packets of cigarettes. Several rolls of counterfeit excise stamps were also destroyed. The destruction exercise marked a significant milestone in the fight against illicit trade and contraband goods in the country. The exercise further underscores the government’s commitment and determination in eradicating illicit trade in the country. KRA impounded the products during various operations carried out in collaboration with the multi-agency team. Illicit trade not only causes unfair competition to legally trading products in the market but also poses potential health hazards to unsuspecting consumers. Illicit trade and contraband goods are also harmful to the economy as they lead to loss of government revenue through tax evasion. KRA has a mandate of trade facilitation and is ready to facilitate all law-abiding traders. "We however warn perpetrators of illicit trade and traders dealing with contraband to cease the illegal practices or face the law," KRA said. Traders found with illicit goods will have their premises closed and trade licenses withdrawn.
