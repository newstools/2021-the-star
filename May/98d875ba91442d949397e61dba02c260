Music producer Magix Enga has apologised to singer Arrow Bwoy. The two were embroiled in a bitter feud, and Magix Enga made amends on Instagram. "Naomba msamaha kama nilikosea, I said what I said out of anger na pia kusota inaeza fanya uchome ukikumbuka deni kidogo kidogo. Keep winning, Mr Arrow Bwoy. God bless your hustle." While promoting a new song a while ago, Arrow Bwoy claimed Magix Enga is a fraud. While denying Arrow Bwoyâ€™s allegations, Magix threw jabs at the Digidigi hitmaker, saying he was a broke artiste who enjoyed faking things. According to the much-sought-after producer, Arrow Bwoy has never paid for his audio projects since they started working together. Arrow Bwoy denied the allegations and termed Magix Enga as one who thrives on controversies.
