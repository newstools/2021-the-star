Limuru MP Peter Mwathi is the new chairperson of the powerful Security Committee of the National Assembly. Mwathi was elected unopposed to take over from the late Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange. Wajir Woman MP Fatuma Gedi, who had expressed interest in the seat, did not submit her application by the deadline. Members of the committee asked their new chairman to take up from where Koinange left. They hailed Mwathi as having what it takes to propel the committee to greater heights. Mwathi was until his election on Tuesday chairman of the Labour Committee. He has been a member of the Parliamentary Service Commission, was the first vice-chair of the privileges committee. Gedi, who is the committee vice-chairperson, said former PM Raila Odinga had expressed his support for Mwathi, hence prevailed upon her to abandon her quest. Mwathi, for his part, thanked the members for the confidence. "I promise we will walk the journey together. The late Koinange was my close friend," he said. Mwathi said the shoes left by Koinange are huge, saying he will try and fit in them. "I will ensure that we deal with the issues that are pending," he said. Mwathi was elected in 2013, having served in the Ministry of Public Works, and NYS.
