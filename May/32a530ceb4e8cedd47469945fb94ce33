Comedian and radio host Herman Kago, popularly known as Professor Hamo, had distanced himself from allegations made by fellow comedian Jemutai, who has said he is the father of her two children. Jemutai sent blogger Edgar Obare audio clips detailing the beginning of the relationship that started in 2015. She further revealed that she first met Hamo while on Churchill Show and the two began a friendship that progressed into an affair although Hamo already had a wife and family in Nakuru. She said that Hamo has rejected her and her children and that she is in a financial crisis, seeking help. "My name is Jemutai and I am comedian and a mother of two. I am a single mother and life is becoming even harder every day. I have lots of rent arrears. I have no other choice so I am selling my Facebook account to anyone in business, it has over 850K followersâ€¦it goes for 2Bob per follower. I want to be able to start business and take care of my kids." Hamo put up a statement on his Instagram page saying he has been providing for his children since day one and that there is no day they went without the basic needs. "My wife sends upkeep for the children who don't live with us. This has been the agreement between my family and the mother of the children." Hamo added that he wished to protect his children and safeguard their privacy and not engage in mudslinging. "Sometimes people can get frustrated when they are not able to get everything they wanted especially when unseen challenges arise," he said. "I have been a present dad to all my children and will continue to work and take care of them." He concluded by saying that he is lost for words as he does not understand where all the allegations are coming from but said he prays for peace. Jemutai had denied dating Hamo three years ago but she now says the reason she has decided to come out was because Hamo had allegedly blocked her phone number.
