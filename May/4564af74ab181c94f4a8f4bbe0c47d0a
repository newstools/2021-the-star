National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has promised to unite residents and leaders from Mt Kenya following his coronation as the region's spokesman. In his first visit to the region since his coronation, Muturi, who spoke at ACK St Paul’s Cathedral in Embu on Sunday, vowed to unite residents despite some leaders' opposition to his coronation at Mukurwe wa Nyagathanga in Murang’a. The speaker said he will hold talks with Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi with whom Meru leaders had requested they consider forming a political party. Some of the leaders from Mt Kenya who have opposed Muturi's coronation as the region's spokesman include Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru and her Murang’a counterpart Mwangi wa Iria. “My work remains the one I am given as the speaker of the National Assembly and of course to unite the people and leaders of Mt Kenya following my coronation. I understand different leaders are giving their views on it and I am okay with that because they are expressing their democratic right,” Muturi said. On the BBI issue, the speaker hinted that for the initiative to sail through using the  parliamentary route, those in support need to hurry because the bill has to be published and disseminated to public for 90 days for citizens to go through. This, he said,  will happen after the bill attains the support of two thirds, which is a total of 233 members, in both the Second and Third reading in Parliament. “The BBI proponents have to hurry to be in line with the required process. It is a possible route they can take,” Muturi added. When asked about his political future plans, the speaker said "that’s a talk for another day". He promised to make a statement when the time is right despite him giving a parable of participating in the race to win gold and not  silver or bronze. The speaker also condoled with the family of former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile, eulogising him as a  brave leader who served the country wholeheartedly. -Edited by SKanyara
