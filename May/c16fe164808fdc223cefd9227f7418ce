Police officers have killed two suspected criminals as they prepared to stage a robbery in Ukunda, Kwale County. The Directorate of Criminal Investigation said the armed suspects were gunned down by detectives on Friday morning just as they were about to rob innocent Kenyans. The police said the suspects defied orders by the sleuths to surrender forcing the detectives to open fire, fatally shooting both. According to the Directorate, the duo were armed with all manner of weapons including knives, machetes and an imitation of a firearm. "Also recovered were assorted cell phone handsets, believed to have been stolen from victims of crime," the DCI said. The gunned down suspects and believed to be part of a criminal gang behind the spate of robberies that have rocked Diani township and its environs in recent days. Bodies of the duo were moved to Kwale Sub-County hospital mortuary, pending identification. This comes barely a day after an ex-police officer was shot dead in an army barrack in Gilgil during a botched robbery attempt. Kenya Defence Forces officers manning the 5KA barracks near the town gunned down the officer and arrested an accomplice with whom they were vandalising signposts. Three suspects were vandalising the sign posts in the barracks when the officers caught up with them. They tried to escape using a motorcycle.
