The National Environment Management Authority has halted stone blasting at Kwa Kilui site in Kitui county. The environment regulator said the county administration, which operates the site, had ignored the plight of people affected by the project. Kitui county director of environment Njoki Mukiti wrote to the Trade and Cooperatives executive on May 4, informing the official of the suspension of work at the site. Mukiri ordered the immediate stoppage of all activity including ballasting at Kwa Kilui ballast crusher. “In consultation with the county director of environment, the office of the deputy county commissioner, Lower Yatta, organise a meeting with the Project Affected Persons to deliberate on the issues of concern and submit a report to Nema,” Mukiri said. The Nema official said that although the authority had issued a licence for the stone and ballast crusher, it had learnt persons affected by the project had not been consulted. The county government of Kitui received the authority to run the project on April 29 through the Nema director general. Residents petitioned Nema, the Kitui governors and the Ministry of Petroleum and Mining soon five days after the licence was granted. In a petition dated May 3, the residents said the potential adverse environmental impact on them posed by the Kwa Kilui crusher had not been addressed. On the same day, Yatta/Kwavonza MCA John Kisangau sued the Kitui government for putting the lives of people living near the crusher in danger Kisangau filed a case at the Land and Environment court in Machakos alleging infringement of the rights of Kwa Kilui residents to clean environment and right to life. The court on May 6 certified the case as urgent and set the hearing date for May 20.
