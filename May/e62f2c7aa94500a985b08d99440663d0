Police are investigating claims by a senior policeman who says he lost Sh1.1 million minutes after withdrawing it from a bank in Gilgil, Nakuru county. The chief inspector of police based at the Anti-Stock Theft Unit in Gilgil said he was robbed of the money and a pistol with 15 bullets that he had in the car. The suspect then drove off in a car parked next to his. The getaway car was later found and impounded in Nakuru town and two suspects arrested. However, the money and the pistol had yet to be recovered. The officer said the incident happened on Monday at 1.53pm. The officer said he had driven from the bank to a local hotel and walked in for lunch. While seated, his car’s alarm went off and when he peeped outside through the window, he noticed a man opening the driver’s door. The suspected then grabbed the money that was in a bag and the Ceska pistol and jumped onto a waiting car before driving towards Nakuru. Police said they suspect the thief had a duplicate key. It is not clear why the officer did not chase him using his car. Senior police officers visited the scene as part of investigations into the incident. The two suspects who were arrested yesterday are under interrogation, a senior police officer in Nakuru said. Meanwhile, in Nairobi’s Spring Valley area,  a licensed gun holder was disarmed after he was involved in a shooting incident. The man told police his car was shot at first smashing the rear windshield. Police said they arrived at the scene and collected six spent cartridges. The motive behind the shooting has yet to be established. The weapon, a Gloak pistol, was taken for ballistic tests to establish if it was used at the scene. There are about 15,000 licensed gun holders and there have been concerns of misuse of the weapons. -Edited by SKanyara
