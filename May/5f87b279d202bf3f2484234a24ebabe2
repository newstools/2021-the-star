Bologna vs Juventus Sunday 9:45 pm Bologna can still secure a top-half finish with a win, provided Verona lose at Napoli, but their current six-game winless run offers little inspiration. Defending is a clear issue, with Bologna conceding in both halves in four of their last five Serie ‘A’ outings. Those defensive issues are a major contributor to Bologna’s abysmal Serie ‘A’ win rate as underdogs. Bologna are also without a top-flight home win versus Juventus this century, with three of the last six defeats seeing them lose one half by a 2-0 scoreline. Juventus will believe they can succeed in that top-four goal, after their record 14th Coppa Italia triumph in midweek. Despite this, only two other teams spent midweek having conceded less average goals per Serie ‘A’ away game than Juventus’ 1.00. The ‘Bianconeri’ are also unbeaten in Serie ‘A’ away matches versus sides below them though 12 of those witnessed both teams score.

Their record in end of season finales suggests they will extend their streak to five, with 2005 the last time they suffered defeat in the final round. With just 25 of 58 points coming at the Emirates this season, it’s obvious where the ‘Gunners’ have fallen down. Indeed their nine competitive losses here in 2020/21 is their worst home record since 1929/30, and their most home league defeats since 1992/93. Letting opponents score first hasn’t helped at home, but netting first should ensure an Arsenal win. A superb come-from-behind 3-2 win against champions Manchester City in midweek was their first victory this season after conceding first meaning Brighton have the chance to claim their highest-ever PL placing with a win here. Brighton do, however, head into this game amid their worst away points return over a four-game period this season, despite securing a half time lead ‘to nil’ in two of those. Relatively strong first halves on the road have actually seen them open the scoring in nine of their 16 PL games.

However six defeats from their last seven matches - five in which they trailed at HT - shows Angers might also be willing cannon fodder for the division’s best away side. The hosts could be a potential banana skin after registering their biggest Ligue 1 home win this term in their previous match here (3-0). However, that was vs already-relegated Dijon, and Angers conceded the opener in four straight home outings prior. Only a win can guarantee Lille are crowned champions, but this gripping title race could still see the top three all finish on 80 points by the end of play. In such a case goal difference, and then goals scored, would decide the title - two metrics that favour defending champions PSG. Therefore Lille must equal or better PSG’s result, and having secured a league-high 12 points during the final ten minutes of fixtures this season, they should have the composure if a late strike is suddenly needed. The last time a L1 title race had one point separating first and second on the final matchday, the second-placed team triumphed, but Lille’s backline - the best away defence across Europe’s top-five divisions with 0.61 goals conceded on average - could be their saving grace. However, a disappointing head-to-head record at Angers during the 21st century will be worrying, despite Lille’s current four-game L1 winning away run coming into this clash.
