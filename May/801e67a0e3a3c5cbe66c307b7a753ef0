Singer Bahati says his wife Diana Marua is the reason he was kicked out of annual gospel awards Groove. In a lengthy post, Bahati said he met Diana and made her his girlfriend within five weeks of seeing each other. Five months later, he had made up his mind about making her his wife, and that is when he introduced her to the world as his ‘prayer partner’, a term that became popular back then. He says soon after making the announcement, his relationship with Groove awards panelists was dented. He, however, did not reveal much and said he will speak about it another time. Bahati wrote, “In five months I requested to meet her parents to ask for their blessings because I was ready to marry her.”
