Nyamira MCAs have questioned the future of health volunteers attached to county health facilities. During a Thursday sitting, they said the internship period has elapsed, hence the individuals should be considered for pay. Magombo MCA wanted to enquire about the policy associated with their status as workers in the county.Â He said those who volunteered should be considered either for pay or for absorption by the county public service board. The county has trained more than 1,000 health volunteers to help counter the Covid-19 pandemic through screening, surveillance and sensitisation. The volunteers help implement random and enhanced screening at strategic points in health facilities and continually disseminate customised awareness and preventive information about the virus. Assembly deputy speaker and Bonyamatuta MCA Robinson Mocheche, who was chairing the Thursday afternoon sitting, directed that the response to the questions be tabled in 14 days.
