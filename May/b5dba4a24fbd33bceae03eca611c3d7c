 Kisii Governor James Ongwae's office and others at the county headquarters have been closed in Covid-19 control measures. County secretary Patrick Lumumba on Thursday said only those considered essential services will be allowed to work from their offices. Staffers will work from home for the next two weeks when a review will be conducted for the resumption of office working. At least 1,400 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the county, with the positivity rate at 5 per cent, according to health officials. Forty-one people have died since the virus swept into the region in March. Health director Richard Onkware said people had relaxed their observance of the Ministry of Health guidelines. Onkware urged the residents to continue observing the guidelines given by the government to control the spread of the disease. "We wish to still plead with our people to ensure they sanitise and keep social distancing as we confront this pandemic," Onkware said by phone Friday morning.  (edited by o. owino)
