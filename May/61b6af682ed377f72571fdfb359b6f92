The United Democratic Alliance has condemned the police for disrupting its meeting in Meru on Monday. The meeting was led by the party secretary-general Veronica Maina. The secretary-general said that the disruption was yet another reminder that the "law enforcement agency has yet to fully embrace democratic processes". “Police, totally unprovoked, invaded a meeting bringing together aspirants from eight counties convened by the party secretariat and lobbed teargas as well as live bullets,” Maina said. She said that the police did not consider people living with disabilities who were also among the attendants. The meeting was part of the party’s meetings being held across the country to popularise it ahead of the 2022 elections. The previous ones were held in Nairobi, Vihiga, Eldoret, and Nakuru, and all were concluded peacefully. According to the SG, the police being led by the Meru Assistant County Commissioner and the Officer Commanding Station did not cite any breach of Covid-19 protocols. The party has asked Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to desist from unwarranted use of force. “Today’s action is part of a continuing trend by the police to harass UDA and its supporters as witnessed recently during the by-elections in Bonchari constituency and Rurii-ward in Nyadarua. We strongly condemn the unlawful disruption of a regular UDA meeting.” The party had said that during the concluded Rurii be-elections, which were won by the UDA aspirant, some of its agents were arrested by the police. The SG had claimed that Brian Mbugua and Daniel Githinji who are agents of the party were arrested by the police in the morning outside Rurii Polytechnic and taken to Ol Kalou Police Station. Maina added that the party agents were harassed and intimidated by the police across the ward.
