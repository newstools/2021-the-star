Gospel artist Christopher Nyangwara Mosioma, alias Embarambamba has come out to defend his name following a viral raunchy video on social media that caused debate from Kenyans as well as his fans. In a video, the electric artist is seen performing at a party while dancing on top of a lady at a club. The video attracted a lot of criticism from Kenyans, with the majority questioning his role as a gospel singer in this era. Kenya Film and Classification Board CEO Ezekiel Mutua, who has lately been concerned with Embarambamba’s style said that the artist had crossed the line. CAS in the Ministry of trade Trade David Osiany said that what the artist did was gross misconduct and inexcusable. But the artist was swift to respond to the criticism, saying that people who are condemning him do not understand the context of the song. He admitted that he was performing at a party that took place in one of the clubs along Thika Road. “Wakenya wamenihukumu, wakenya wamenitusi, mafans wangu wamekasirika wengine wakisema eti mimi sijaokoka. Lakini wakenya wenzangu, hii video, kabla hujacommend, angalia statement yake kwanza (Kenyans have criticised me, they have insulted me and my fans are mad at me, some saying that I am not a Christian. But my fellow Kenyans, before you commend, look at the statement of the song),” Embarambamba said. He added the song itself which he was performing was condemning the immorality that people have been doing and forgetting their God. “Jesus came into this world for the sake of sinners…when Jesus was in this world, He sat with the sinners. The reason was that the sinners would be born again and know God,” he said. He concluded that; “You cannot say that Embarambamba should not attend political events or clubs because they are earthly things. God brought us into this world.” According to him, some people are spreading rumours that he is dead, which has caused pain to his family, yet he is much alive.
