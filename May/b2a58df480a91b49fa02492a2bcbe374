Twitter has introduced - Tip Jar – a new way for people to send and receive tips. You’ll know an account’s Tip Jar is enabled if you see a Tip Jar icon next to the Follow button on their profile page. Tap the icon, and you’ll see a list of payment services or platforms that the account has enabled. Select whichever payment service or platform you prefer and you’ll be taken off Twitter to the selected app where you can show your support in the amount you choose. The services* you can add today include Bandcamp, Cash App, Patreon, PayPal and Venmo. "Twitter takes no cut. On Android, tips can also be sent within Spaces," Twitter said. With this, one can share his or her PayPal link after your Tweet goes viral, adding your Cashtag to your profile. With this, people can support your work, dropping your Venmo handle on your birthday or if you just need some extra help. Tip Jar is an easy way to support the incredible voices that make up the conversation on Twitter. Everyone using Twitter in English can send tips to applicable accounts on Twitter for iOS and Android. For now, a limited group of people around the world who use Twitter in English can add Tip Jar to their profile and accept tips. This group includes creators, journalists, experts, and nonprofits. Soon, more people will be able to add Tip Jar to their profile and we’ll expand to more languages.
