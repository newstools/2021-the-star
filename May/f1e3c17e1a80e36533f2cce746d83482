Kiss FM co-host Jalang'o says he was star-struck the day he met former US President Barack Obama. Jalang'o was the MC during Obama's visit to Kenya in 2018. He went blank for a minute while speaking to Obama and all he could utter was, "Yes, sir." "So the frisking and everything happened and you are allowed into the venue. So Obama walks in and the best thing is I was in a room with him while I was being briefed." He thought it was over when he welcomed Obama on stage, only for the President to walk towards him. "He stretches his hand but I can hardly remember anything he said." Jalang'o said the event opened doors for him and he got to MC many more corporate and presidential events. Edited by T Jalio
