A Ugandan former child soldier who became a commander of the rebel Lord's Resistance Army has been sentenced to 25 years in jail by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Dominic Ongwen, known as White Ant, was convicted in February of more than 60 crimes including murder, torture, rape and sexual enslavement. Prosecutors argued that Mr Ongwen receive a lower prison term because he had been abducted by the LRA as a child. The rebel movement was formed more than thirty years ago, operating in Uganda and neighbouring countries. It mutilated people by cutting off parts of their faces.
