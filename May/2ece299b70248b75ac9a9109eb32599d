The Kenya Bureau of Standards(KEBS) has approved six standards that will fast track the development of eco and socio-friendly cities that utilise Information Communication Technology(ICT) to offer high quality life for Kenyans. “As Kenya continues to rapidly urbanise, we increasingly rely on technological solutions to create sustainable living patterns; manage resource consumption in water and energy, enhance smart infrastructure development, ease access to government service as well as tackle environmental challenges such as garbage disposal and recycling” said Bernard Njiraini, Managing Director, KEBS. Njiraini added that the approved standards will facilitate the transformation of urban infrastructures into smart and sustainable infrastructures as envisioned in the country’s Vision 2030. Some of the issues addressed by the standards include real time data and informatics exchange, smart transportation and electric power infrastructures. These will ensure efficient urban operations and services and competitiveness, while responding to social, economic, environmental as well as cultural needs of present and future generations are met. Locally, Tatu and Konza cities (also known as the Silicon Savannah of Kenya) have been earmarked as smart cities. Additionally, reports by the Intelligent Community Forum (ICF) rank Nairobi as one of the most advanced smart cities in Africa with peers such as Cape Town.
