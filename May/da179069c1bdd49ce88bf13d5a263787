The Kiss FM 'My Ride Grand Finale' is finally here. The event will be held this Friday from 10am-1pm at the Trade Mark Hotel. It was scheduled to take place on March 27 but was postponed due to the revised measures announced by the President last month to combat the spread of Covid-19. The Kiss My Ride campaign began in February 2020, where more than 10,000 Kenyans participated in the campaign. The campaign managed to get 34 finalists, who succeeded in getting into the main draw. The 34 participants will each get a key and will be granted the chance to try to open the car of their dreams at the Trademark Hotel this Friday.
