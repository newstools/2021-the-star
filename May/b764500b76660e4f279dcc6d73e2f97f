Migori county clergy have called President Uhuru Kenyatta to mitigate against high cost of living in the country to safeguard his legacy. Under the Migori chapter of the National Council of Churches Kenya (NCCK), the clergy said Uhuru  should help reverse increase of taxes and reduce high fuel prices to curtail inflation. “The high cost of living and inflation has been made worse as income of people have been depleted by Covid 19 pandemic,” Canon Joshua Abulo said. In a statement read to the press in Migori town on May 28, the NCCK said they are deeply concerned about the continued suffering “due to constant rise of prices of basic commodities.” “We plead with the government to reverse the recent increase of taxes and price of fuel to give citizens a chance to weather through this difficult,” Abulo said. He said many families have lost loved ones and source of income because of Covid- 19, urging measures to control the virus should be open and transparent to give hope to Kenyans. “There is a strong need for transparency and accountability on management of Covid-19 response funds by speedily prosecuting suspects and recovering stolen loot to give confidence to Kenyans,” he said. At the same time, the clergy asked clergies to safeguard the pulpit ahead of 2022 general election and prevent churches from being used as campaign platform. “We must not allow worship services to become toxic as politicians and aspirants use the place of worship as a battlefield. This will be our contribution to reduce tension in the country,” he said. He was speaking after meeting with several clergy members to deliberate on the way forward for the county and the country.
