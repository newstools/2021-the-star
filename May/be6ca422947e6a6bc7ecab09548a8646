In a remote tea-growing village in Bomet Central a little-known school is basking in glory. Kimargis Mixed School, with a stalled building that meets everyone who enters through the gate, has never had anything to boast about, until now. A student who enrolled in the school with 190 marks has scored a B- in the 2020 KCSE exam. A first for the school. Dennis Cheruiyot was a student from whom little was expected, if his KCPE exam marks were anything to go by. Now he has given hope to thousands of learners — it is not the school one ends up in that determines your success. It's hard work and determination, the shy 20-year-old says. “When you are focused and determined in achieving a particular goal in life, you will surely get it…Your past cannot determine your future,” he said in an interview. It is these qualities that earned his teachers trust and made them appoint him the school captain, out of hundreds of others. Cheruiyot used to trek six kilometres to school. That did not deter him. The grade, he says, did not surprise him because he worked hard to earn it. The fourth-born son in a family of six, Cheruiyot said he wants to be a teacher. He wants to encourage other children who post low marks. “I want to be a role model to others…A teacher can shape an individual to be who they want to be in life and that is exactly what I also want to be,” Cheruiyot said. Board of management chairman Joseah Langat said the good performance will inspire other students across the country to work harder. He said with the 100 per cent transition policy the school will not lock out any student. Their focus is to mould students in whom other schools have lost faith.
