President Uhuru Kenyatta has appointed Justice William Ouko as a Judge of the Supreme Court. Ouko was nominated for the position by the the Judicial Service Commission last week. . He will join the court to replace Justice Jackton Ojwang who retired in February last year. The JSC had shortlisted all the nine candidates who applied for the position. Those who applied to join the apex court include Justice Ouko and his Court of Appeal colleagues Koome, Kathurima M'Inoti, High Court judges Joseph Sergon and Chitembwe, Prof Lumumba Nyaberi, Ms Yano and Justices Marete and Nderi. However, judge Kathurima withdrew his candidature while justice Koome also automatically became disqualified because she was nominated as CJ. Justice Ouko was appointed a Court of Appeal judge in 2012. He became the President of the Court of Appeal on March 9, 2018, after he was elected overwhelmingly by fellow judges. Justice Ouko served in the High Court from 2004 to 2012. During that time, he served in Malindi, Meru and Nakuru.
