 Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss for Embakasi Simon Mwongela will be charged with the murder of a night guard in Njiru. The senior superintendent of police will take plea on Monday at the High Court in Milimani, Nairobi. The development comes after Makadara principal magistrate Jacky Kibosia ruled Mwongela has a case to answer. On Friday, he was arraigned before Kibosia under a miscellaneous application. Investigating officer Moses Dindi confirmed to have completed his probe into the fatal shooting and told court he was ready to charge the suspect. The magistrate declined to grant the suspect bond as sought by his lawyers and said the matter will be determined at the trial court. Mwongela was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing Lapaja Topiwo Laizer on May 13 at Red Square Hotel within Njiru area along Kangundo road. Topiwo, a Tanzania national, was barely a month old at the hotel where he was working as a watchman. Topiwoâ€™s family lawyer Francis Kalwa confirmed that the 20-year-old's body was picked and buried at their home in Tanzania last weekend. Mwongela had on May 17 been arraigned before Makadara senior resident magistrate Lewis Gatheru where the investigating officer sought 10 days to detail him pending investigations. Dindi, a police commissioner, said the guard was shot after he had a disagreement with the officer at 3:50am at the hotel. He said that the suspect had booked accommodation at the hotel by the help of a friend named Alfred Nzau Kivuva. After the shooting, Mwongela was disarmed and escorted to Kileleshwa police station where he was detained. Kalwa had objected the release of the suspect on bond saying he was a senior police officer and was likely to interfere with investigations. Kibosia ordered the suspect to remain at Kileleshwa police station until Monday when he will be charged with murder.  Edited by P.O
