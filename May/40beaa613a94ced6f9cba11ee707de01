Jambojet has resumed operations in all five of its local destinations, following President Uhuru Kenyatta's announcement of lifting of the partial lockdown. In a statement on Sunday, Jambojet said customers are free to book flights to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret, Ukunda and Malindi. The carrier had suspended operations on March 29 after the President had announced cessation of movement into and out of five counties which had been classified as one zone. The counties are Nairobi, Machakos, Kajiado, Kiambu and Nakuru. However, Uhuru, during his Labour Day speech on Saturday, lifted the lockdown. The President, however, warned that restrictions could be re-escalated if Kenyans do not cooperate by following safety protocols. He also said the restrictions could be de-escalated if Kenyans do their part to curb the spread of the coronavirus. “If we fail to play our individual role, like it or hate it, it is my responsibility to protect life, I will do what I can to prevent what is happening in other countries,” he said. Uhuru's lifting of the lockdown came as businesspeople and Kenyans at large raised concerns about the state of the economy following restrictions.
