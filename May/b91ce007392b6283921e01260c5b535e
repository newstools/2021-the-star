Police in Nairobi's Kilimani area are probing a case in which a father, mother and brother of a 15-year-old girl, are suspected to have beaten her to death on Thursday night for running away from home. The couple and their son were arrested after the girl died in hospital. A clinical officer at Coptic hospital told detectives that on May 20 at around 9pm, the hospital received a 15-year-old patient, who was a student at Kiteta Girls Secondary in Mbooni, Makueni County. She was accompanied by her father for a medical check up after she had allegedly run away from home and failed to report at school. She was examined and discharged. The father then took her back home to  Jamhuri showground quarters. However, in the wee hours of Friday, the girl was rushed to the same hospital after she allegedly collapsed at home following a serious beating from her father, mother who works at ASK show-ground and the girl's elder brother who is a student at the Technical University of Kenya. According to police, she was pronounced dead on arrival. The clinical officer said her entire body had bruises, a sign that she had been grievously assaulted. Detectives from DCI Kilimani who visited the scene recovered one PPR pipe believed to have been used to beat the girl and is being held as an exhibit. As further investigations continue, the three suspects have being placed in custody at Kilimani police station. The body is awaiting postmortem at the Coptic hospital morgue. Nairobi police boss Augustine Nthumbi said his officers are investigating the matter. “We will seek more time to hold them as the probe goes on,” he said.
