Nairobi City Stars coach Sanjin Alagic has expressed his excitement following the lifting of the suspension of sports activities by President Uhuru Kenyatta. “I really look forward to start training. I am very happy. It was boring without training and matches,” said the tactician told the club’s portal. The team resumed training on Monday ahead of a busy schedule which will see teams play at least two games in a week. “The players really looking forward to sports resumption and on Monday, they turned up for training without fail,” said club chief executive officer Patrick Korir on the club's website . City Stars team coordinator Samson Otieno, said:  “This is indeed very good news. We were lost during the suspension and not sure what to do. Now we can focus on the remainder of games in the season.” He added: “We are now waiting for fixtures from the league managers to allow us plan our logistics accordingly.” Alagic, who returned to the country from Bosnia two weeks ago said: “Bosnia is also under lockdown due to a rise in coronavirus cases. However, sports have not been affected and the league is still on,” “It is, therefore, my hope that just like in Bosnia, that our league will resume in due course.” City Stars last game was a round 16 clash against Tusker on March 20 and ended in a 2-2 draw. By the time of suspension, City Stars were 10th in the 18-team log with 20 points. When the league resumes, City Stars will be up against champions in the 17th and final game of the first leg before venturing into second leg fixtures as well as domestic Cup games.
