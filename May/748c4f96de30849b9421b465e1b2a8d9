The Kenya Bureau of Standards has approved six standards that will accelerate the growth of eco and socio-friendly cities that will offer Kenyans high quality life. In a statement on Thursday, Kebs managing director Bernard Njiraini said the standards will address among other things;  real time data and informatics exchange, smart transportation and electric power infrastructures. "The approved standards will facilitate the transformation of urban infrastructures into smart and sustainable infrastructures as envisioned in the country’s Vision 2030," said Njiraini. The Kebs MD noted that Kenya is increasingly relying on technological solutions to create sustainable living patterns. "This will manage resource consumption in water and energy, enhance smart infrastructure development, ease access to government service as well as tackle environmental challenges such as garbage disposal and recycling," Njiraini added. In Kenya, Tatu and Konza cities have been earmarked as smart cities. This comes a few days after the Kenya Bureau of Standards approved two new standards on management practices to boost businesses’ capacity to respond to the Covid-19 protocols. Kenya Standards KS ISO 22301:2019 and KS ISO 22392:2020 aim to enhance organizations’ ability to recognize disruptive changes in an environment and adjust to them.
