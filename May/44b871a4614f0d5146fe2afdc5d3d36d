Farmers in Bungoma county have been urged to apply for loans from the Agricultural Financial Corporation to boost their income. AFC managing director George Kubai said despite the county having the potential to be a food basket, there is a low uptake of agriloans. The MD said farmers should stop fearing that their farms will be auctioned if they delay repaying loans. "If Bungoma farmers want to kick poverty out of their lives, then I encourage them to involve us so that we can give them credit facilities," Kubai said. He said the corporation gives affordable loans. Kubai spoke during a groundbreaking ceremony for AFC offices in Bungoma town. He is optimistic that with the new offices, which are bigger and easily accessible, will boost farmers' loan intake. "I call upon the local leadership and the community to be active partners of the branch so that local farmers can access our products," he said. Deputy Governor Charles Ngome and farmers attended the event. Ngome asked the corporation to do away with some demands before they give out loans. "AFC should do away with many demands before they process a loan but compete with other institutions where requirements are minimal," he said. Edited by A.N
