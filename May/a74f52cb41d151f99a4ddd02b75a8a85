Safaricom on Thursday unveiled Baze, a mobile-first, video-on-demand service that offers a wide selection of local and regional short-form videos in the entertainment world. The service will be accessible via *544*55# or www.baze.co.ke, giving customers the convenience of accessing a vast collection of video content, including first-run exclusives, on their smartphones. Chief customer officer Sylvia Mulinge said the goal is to entertain customers by providing a carefully curated collection of video content across their favourite genres. "Baze will place the entertainment Kenyans want at their fingertips, giving users freedom, choice and control over the content they consume." Speaking during the launch, Kaka Empire's King Kaka said, "The fact that I run Kaka Empire, my mission has always been, how do we grow content and make revenue from it? "So seeing such a platform is exciting. With this platform, I know that I am not only fighting for Kaka Empire but also for all artistes and content creators." Homeboyz Gmoney said it's always good to create space for creatives. Customers can choose from two subscription plans: an all-day pass at Sh10 and an all-day pass with 200MB data at Sh20. Baze will also provide content creators with an additional platform to share their stories with Kenyans while increasing their earnings by monetising their content.
