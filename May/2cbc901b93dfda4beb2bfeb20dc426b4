From theÂ 767, 161 candidates who sat the exams, 380,327 were males and 366,834 females with 50.90 and 41.90 gender parity. "As a matter of fact in 15 counties more females enrolled than males. The counties, Taita Taveta, Kwale, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang'a, Kiambu, Machakos, Embu, Kisumu, Kitui, Nandi, Meru, Elgeyo Marakwet, Kakamega, Vihiga," Magoha said Counties with high gender disparity in favour of males are Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Turkana and Homa Bay. Magoha said that after looking at the figures closely, he noted that there was almost one to two disparities. "I'm going to instruct the field officers in these counties to find out what is happening to the girls there. Are they marrying them too early and covering up under culture and if that is so we must burst it and make sure the girls can go to school. Marriage can wait at least for another four years," Magoha instructed. Magoha also said 2020 KCSE exam candidates performed better compared to those from the previous year. He said that all the 747,161 students who sat the exam will be absorbed in universities, colleges as well as TVET institutions.
