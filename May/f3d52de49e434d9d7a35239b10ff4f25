Over many years, I have noted that most of us are still in “city mode” when we enter a national park and would like to see as much of the created wonders as possible. Our challenge is to quickly snap out of “city mode” into “bush mode”. This week I thought it would be helpful to note some points that work for me. There is always something attractive about water, perhaps because it brings life, but we also seem to be fascinated by water power, like waves, waterfalls and flooding. The park has a number of water points spread across a wide area. It includes many dams, such as the Athi dam, and a number of seasonal streams that flow into the Mbagathi River. During drier times when water levels are lower, it can be very rewarding to plan your visit to the park by maximising your time at various water points. For example, if you decide to spend time at the Athi dam, find a parking position that will ensure good clear vision, so that waiting will have wonderful rewards as nature happens around you. Very often, large herds come and drink, like zebra, buffalo and Eland. It is also interesting to watch the many bird species at the same time. Occasionally, hippos and crocodiles can be seen. Sightings of predators like lions are also mostly had by those who wait patiently. When waiting and watching, it is good to have some refreshments with you. The following items are also useful: the Nairobi National Park Guide Book (Kifaru shop and Fonnap office, main gate), a good East African bird book, binoculars and a decent camera. I hope your time just waiting at the water will be restful and be like a “soul tonic”, with moments of nature in action. For info on the park link to the following website  www.kws.go.ke
