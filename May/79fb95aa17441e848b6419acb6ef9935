The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority has suspended all flights to and from Somalia in a notice to airmen on Tuesday. In the notice, the Kenyan government did not give any reasons for the action. The ban comes days after Qatar brokered a breakthrough that saw Mogadishu restore diplomatic ties with Nairobi. Somalia restored diplomatic relations with Kenya after five months following mediation by Qatar led by Emir Sheikh Tamim Al Thani. Somalia's Ministry of Information said they were resuming the relations “in keeping with the interests of good neighbourliness”. “The two governments agree to keep friendly relations between the two countries on the basis of principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence,” the statement said. Acknowledging the development, Kenya's Foreign Affairs ministry said it looks forward to furthering normalisation of relations by the Somali authorities. More to follow
