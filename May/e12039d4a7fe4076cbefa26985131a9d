 Students pursuing the bachelor degrees have been urged to aim higher for master's and PhDs so they can be more marketable. Such higher academic achievements will make them more competitive and avoid the crowded pool of job seekers with first degrees, Mount Kenya University VC Prof Deogratius Jaganyi said. He was addressing new students joining the institution on Tuesday. He urged them to aspire to study at master’s level, saying the bachelor’s degree had become saturated. The number of graduates in the job market continues to grow every year, although employment opportunities are declining. “I would like to encourage you to study further. Look at the first degree as a stepping stone and look forward to advancing your studies to master’s levels because the bachelor’s level is very crowded,” Jaganyi said. The freshmen were the first lot of students that Jaganyi was taking through the orientation, having joined the university as VC earlier this year. “I would also like to challenge you to go beyond masters to PhD where your name titles will change to doctor (Dr.)…. I also hope that in about 25-30 years from today, some of you will become professors and take leadership positions at universities not just in Kenya but the region and the world. Nothing is beyond your grasp as long as you work hard towards achieving it,” he said. He urged the learners to act responsibly, saying being at the university will give them more independence compared to what they may have been used to while in secondary school. “Life in a university requires personal leadership. This is because there is no close monitoring of your daily activities. In this scenario, you must develop traits that guide the direction of your life instead of letting time and chance to determine your course. In this phase of your life, it is important to establish personal life goals,” he said.  Edited by P.O
