Nairobi County leaders joined mourners on Saturday to bid farewell to Nairobi County Assembly first speaker Alex Ole Magelo in Kajiado. Magelo died last Saturday at Nairobi Hospital where he had been hospitalized. The MCAs led by county assembly speaker Benson Mutura eulogized Magelo as a father and a nobleman. The MCAs who were fortunate to have served in the assembly during Magelo’s tenure said he never harboured any ill feelings towards anyone and believed in resolving issues amicably. In August last year, Magelo withdrew from the race to succeed Beatrice Elachi as the speaker and instead supported Jubilee Party's candidate former Makadara MP Benson Mutura. Magelo said he had decided to withdraw for the sake of unity and had faith that Mutura had all it takes to be the third Speaker of the county assembly. “I have withdrawn myself from the election. I also have a new job that was assigned by the President. I’m in support of the Jubilee’s candidate and have confidence in him and his ability to lead the assembly,” he said then. Speaker Mutura eulogized Magelo as a just man and a firm speaker who not only served with diligence in his tenure but promoted peace in the assembly. Deputy Governor Ann Kananu eulogized Magelo as a man who served the Legislative and Executive with a lot of dedication, diligence, kindness, wisdom and humility. “Alex unreservedly gave me political advice when necessary and without fear or favor.  To Lucy, my prayer partner, sister and dear friend my door will always be open for you and the children. May Alex, rest in Peace,” Kananu said.
