High school is one of the most significant periods in every student’s life. Here you understand the meaning of survival. Following the new curriculum, I clearly see the gaps in the 8-4-4 system. An average student starts Form 1 at 12-14 years. Is the system exhaustive? This is a very young age where the young student is at the peak of cognitive, emotional and moral maturity. At this age, one is supposed to stay at school with their peers for close to three months without getting in touch with their families. This has brought about emotional disconnection, lack of empathy and an effect on the whole being. This should be the reason why Magoha’s team in the government wants to do away with boarding schools. They expose the pupils too much and install in them permanent behaviour. The policies are also intense and might cause long term negative effect on the student. George Magoha in his speech stated that the government chooses the schools that the candidates will attend in line with their capabilities and performance. However, I do not root for the stratification: national schools, extra-county schools etc. Children should not be separated because of their mental capacity differences. Instead, they should be placed geographically, the highest performer with a low performer, to help each other out and interact. This division and having different classes of schools will continue to widen the academic gap. Congratulations to all 2021 KCPE candidates. Hard work pays; the process of Becoming is just starting and it will affect our Being.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
