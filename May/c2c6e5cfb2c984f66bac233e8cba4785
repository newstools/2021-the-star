Parking attendants will start taking photos of the number plates of vehicles whose drivers violate parking rules. A notice on Tuesday by KRA and Nairobi county said the photography has been necessitated by disputes arising from penalty charges. It was published in local dailies. Photos will be used in case of disputes. “We have received numerous complaints from motorists disputing penalties imposed for failure to pay parking fees,” the notice reads. It was signed by the deputy county commissioner for revenue. It instructs motorists with VIP stickers dated 2020 to renew them. They expired on December 31 and are no longer valid. They can be renewed through the Nairobi Revenue System (NRS) Parking System. “A list of all vehicles that qualify for VIP parking have been uploaded into the NRS Parking System,” reads the notice. Parking attendants will use KRA querying devices to confirm the status of VIP stickers. The motorists will not be allowed to park on pavements and council gardens. FRAUDSTERS The notice also warns motorists to be vigilant of fraudsters posing as parking attendants. Motorists have had numerous encounters with and sometimes fallen prey to the scammers who pose as attendants. Attendants are to be in uniform at all times and wear a visible identification badge issued by the county. In case of any suspicion, vehicle owners should call the KRA contact centre on 0709 014 747 or email nrbrevenueservices@kra.go.ke. The notice urges motorists to promptly pay seasonal fees. They can be paid through the authorised short code message system *647#. Nonpayment of parking fees leads to clamping and towing of vehicles. The owner of any clamped vehicle pays a clamping fee to the assembly. Motorists must not damage or attempt to remove the clamp. (Edited by V. Graham)
