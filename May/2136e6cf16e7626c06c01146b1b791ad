The Kisumu government, in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization, has donated personal protective equipment to small traders and farmers in the county. Agriculture chief officer Paul Omanga on Monday distributed the PPEs to the two groups to boost their war on Covid-19. The beneficiaries received five thermo guns, 10 handwashing units and 100 packets of surgical masks. They also got 35 litres of liquid soap and 31 industrial gloves. Traders welcomed the initiative, saying it came at the right time following a recent announcement by Acting Director General for Health Patrick Amoth of an anticipated fourth Covid-19 wave in July this year. Omanga said the programme seeks to enhance the capacity of traders and farmers in addressing Covid-19 challenges as they deal with many customers, which puts them at a higher risk of contracting the disease. “Research has revealed that Covid-19 is not only transmitted through contact but is also airborne, so you must follow the laid down health protocols to keep safe,” he said. County director for livestock Charles Kakuku called on the recipients of the PPE to be vigilant in the fight against Covid-19 so as not to lose the economic gains made in the county. “Be ambassadors and sensitise those you interact with in business to take personal responsibility in following the laid down Covid-19 protocols. Treat everyone next to you as a victim, until proven otherwise,” he said. Kibuye waste management group secretary Simon Meso thanked the county and FAO for the donation. “We feel happy and honoured to receive the donations. This will go a long way in protecting us as we discharge our duties,” Meso said.  Edited by A.N
