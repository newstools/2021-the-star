Pesticides used to control desert locusts killed bees and forced other swarms to migrate hence disrupting honey production in Mwingi, farmers have said. Zakayo Mwangangi, a bee farmer in Waita ward who has 137 beehives, said the returns were significantly lower. “I did not receive good produce this time as the majority of my beehives were left without bees,” Mwangangi said. The Mwingi Beekeepers and Food Crop Cooperative member said the Covid-19 pandemic led to low sales. Many people were rendered jobless and harsh economic times reduced the buying power, he said. “We make very low sales at the cooperative and urge the county government to step in and help us in finding a market for our honey,” Mwangangi said. He also urged farmers to bring their honey together in cooperatives to beat brokers out to fleece them. Kitui value addition specialist Temi Mutia said the county government has secured honey markets in the Middle East. He urged farmers to join cooperatives to ensure they have enough honey that will sustain the market. He spoke when he visited the Mwingi Beekeepers and Food Crop Cooperative. Mutia also encouraged other farmers in Mwingi to consider bee farming as it is low on capital but has high returns. (edited by o. owino)
