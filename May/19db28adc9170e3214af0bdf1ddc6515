Wales' Elfyn Evans claimed the Rally de Portugal - but failed to take the lead in the World Rally Championship. The Toyota driver won three of the final five stages to finish 28.3 seconds ahead of Spain's Dani Sordo. Evans finished fifth on the final power stage, picking up one bonus point. But WRC leader Sebastien Ogier claimed three points after coming third on the final stage behind Thierry Neuville and Ott Tanak, two drivers who retired earlier in the race and rejoined. "It feels good. We perhaps weren't the fastest crew this weekend, but we had really good pace and kept out of trouble and obviously did enough to keep Dani at bay today," said Evans, after the Welshman had claimed his fourth career victory. "It comes at a good time, so I'm happy to take this one." In the overall standings, the 25 points for winning this weekend's rally means Evans and co-driver Scott Martin now have 77 points, while Toyota team-mate Ogier, who finished third in Portugal, has 79 after four events. Takamoto Katsuta was fourth, while Englishman Gus Greensmith finished fifth after mechanical issues checked his progress over the weekend. Former Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Porto football manager Andre Villas-Boas was making his WRC debut, competing in the third tier of the championship. Villas-Boas's passion for the sport prompted him to enter the event in his home country, but he finished down the field. Evans finished second at the Croatia Rally in April despite leading going into the final stage, with Ogier just beating his team-mate by just 0.6 seconds.
