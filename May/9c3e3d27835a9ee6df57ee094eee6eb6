A group of women in Mwingi West have formed a basketry and soap making group as a way of surviving the Covid-19 crisis. Through Crisbel Foundation, an NGO formed by one of their members, the women are now making baskets using sisal and sell them locally and abroad after value addition. They have also established an aloe vera plantation where they obtain some of the materials for making medicated soap for sale. Group founder Christine Mutoni said she was touched by the suffering of women and young girls who had been impregnated in Mwingi, Kitui and Kajiado, especially during this Covid-19 period. “I decided to bring women, especially the vulnerable, orphans, widows, and young mothers, together to keep them busy and most importantly create a venture for them to earn a living,” she said. Mutoni supplies them with raw materials for making baskets, soap, and leatherwork. She, however, said the number of young girls who have dropped out of school in Kitui is overwhelming and a partnership with well-wishers and the county government is necessary. “Following the Covid-19 pandemic, many girls have dropped out of school and they need closer supervision. So, I call upon the government and other stakeholders to step in and lend a helping hand,” she urged. Juliana Nguli, one of the beneficiaries, said that women have really benefitted. "This organisation has helped us. We are now able to get money for our basic needs,” she said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
