The weatherman has issued an advisory regarding the ongoing heavy rains being experienced in most parts of the country. The director at the Kenya Meteorological Department David Gikungu said on Monday that the rainfall is expected to intensify to more than 30mm in 24 hours over the Highlands of West of the Rift Valley Lake Victoria Basin, the Central Rift Valley, Northwest, the South-Eastern lowlands and the northeast of the Rift Valley including Nairobi from May 10-12, 2021. The heavy rainfall is projected to reduce in intensity on Thursday. Gikungu said that due to already high water levels in rivers and other water retention areas, the rains might cause flooding over flood plains and other areas that are not well-drained. Mudslides and landslides are also likely to occur on hilly areas of the Highlands of West Rift Valley and the Highlands East of Rift Valley due to the saturated soils. Among the areas of concern include Kisii, Kericho, Nyamira, Bomet, Nakuru, Narok, Migori, Nandi, Bungoma, Homabay, Kisumu, Siaya, Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Busia, Vihiga, West Pokot, Nyandarua, Laikipia, Kajiado, Machakos, Embu, Muranga, and Turkana.
