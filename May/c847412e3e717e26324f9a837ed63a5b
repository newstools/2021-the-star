Lilian Chemweno is keen to embrace the 50km race going forward after finishing second at the Nedbank Runified Breaking Barriers ultra-race last weekend in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Chemweno said she has opted for the 50km speciality after encountering many challenges in marathon running, where expectations and level of competition is too high. The athlete, who trains under Erick Kimaiyo in Kapsait Training camp in Elgeyo Marakwet County, said she was inspired by Justine Chesire to take up the 50km race. “I missed several opportunities to compete in major marathons for lack of qualifying time and opted for the ultra-marathons,” said the former Padoca Marathon silver medallist. On Sunday, Chemweno finished second in the 50km race in 3 hours 05 minutes behind South African Irvete Van Zyl who won in a new record of 3:04:23. “I talked to Chesire who used to run 56km and 90km and he advised me that if I can endure the long run, I can make it,” said Chemweno, adding that she was happy to be part of the historic moment. "When Chesire informed me of the 50km race in South Africa, I alerted my coach and he immediately drew a training programme for the assignment. "In my first training session, I covered 59km in 3 hours 19 minutes at Kapsait and followed it up with 49km and 45km respectively in Kachibora area, finishing the latter in 2hours 49 minutes," she said. Chemweno added: “Throughout my training, my coach was happy and gave me green light to compete. I was prepared both psychologically, physically and mentally and that is why I posted good time on my debut,” added Chemweno. She said she is preparing to compete in a 59km race with the hope of bagging her first win but will also be on the lookout for  any 24km race in the near future.
