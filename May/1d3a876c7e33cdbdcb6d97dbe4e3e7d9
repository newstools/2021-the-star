Former Prime Minister, Raila Odinga, has said that the youth are Africa's greatest resource and must be molded to achieve their full potential. In a statement, to mark Africa Day on Tuesday, Raila said it's time Africans apply their thoughts, energies and resources towards making the continent greater than those Africans helped build. The ODM party leader noted that Africans helped to shape many countries across the world that went on to become great nations. "In an earlier century, our ancestors were forcefully taken through the 'doors of no return,' to start a journey of slavery and shame in distant lands." "In the 21st Century, the irony of our people now willfully walking through those gates to the same destinations in search of opportunities should pain and push us into action," Raila said. He called on Africans to resist any attempts to return them to the dark days of slavery, insisting that we must not let our circumstances win. "On this day, letâ€™s reflect on our painful struggle to liberate ourselves and reject all attempts to take ourselves back into slavery and colonialism through actions that negate why we fought for freedom," Raila said. He added that Africans must give decency and expect decency in return.
