West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi has criticised a section of leaders opposed to the ruling by the High Court that scuttled the BBI process. The MP, an ally of Deputy President William Ruto, said the resources used to popularise the BBI and signature collection would have been used for development to help the economy recover from the effects of Covid-19. “We know there are a lot of resources that have been set aside for BBI and the referendum, but now that the court has ruled otherwise, these resources should be set aside to empower small businesses,” Kemosi said. He was speaking on Tuesday at Gianchore PAG Secondary School when he handed over a school bus to the institution. He said this is not the time for rushing to the courts to appeal the ruling, but a time for leaders to think about how to develop the country. “I wish to remind our government that this is not the time to rush to court, rather this is the time the government needs to concentrate on delivering services,” Kemosi said.
