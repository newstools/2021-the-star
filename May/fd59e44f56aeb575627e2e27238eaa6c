Nairobi informal settlements are progressive, becoming accessible as Kenya Urban Roads Authority completes 57.1km out of the intended 408 km roads in the informal settlements. This is part of the Sh5.8 billion aimed at upgrading 408km of access roads across informal settlements in Nairobi county. Works done by the authority include re-carpeting of roads and upgrading to Carbo and Asphalt Concrete (Bitumen ). Kura’s Cooperate Communication Officer John Cheboi said on Wednesday that the project was in progress with very minimal challenges. "As we Kura, we are on course to cover the 408km as the completion date is in November 2022 despite the Covid-19 pandemic and rains," he said. The data from  Kura's Director General Silas Kinoti, as seen by the Star, the team reveals that as of April 30, 2021, 5.3km had been covered in Mukuru, Dagarotti-18.6km, Kawangware-10.8km, Kangemi -2.1km, Kibera -1.7km, and Korogocho-1.2km. Also in Mathare, Kura had covered 1.5km , Roysambu 7.7km, Githurai 17.8km, Kasarani -10.9km and 23.5km in  Dandora,Utawala, Mihang’o and  Ruai . Kura's DG Kinoti had earlier observed that the project will be a game-changer where it will open up the slums to connect with other parts of Nairobi via the road network. “Most of these areas have suffered from poor road network making accessibility of critical services and other essentials a challenge. This has led to difficulties in emergency and disaster response including fire outbreaks and other emergency services hampered by inaccessibility,” he said. The upgrading of 408.44 kilometers of roads will include  70kilometres in Mukuru, Dagoretti -30km, Kawangware- 22.6km, Kangemi-41km, Kibera-22.8km, Korogocho- 13.6km, and Mathare-18.2km. Roysambu 50.76 kilometers of the road will be upgraded, Githurai-57.48 kilometers, Kasarani Mwiki 42 km, and Dandora, Utawala, Mihang’o and  Ruai will have 40km of road done. Where adequate space is available,  Kura will also install the road furniture inclusive of walkways and cycle lanes. Areas like Kibra, Mathare, and Mukuru kwa Njenga slums have already been marked as Special Planning Areas by the Nairobi Metropolitan Service. This was in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s March 18, 2020, directive to the Nairobi Metropolitan Service to undertake slum-upgrading initiatives in the capital. One of the many objectives of the declaration was to develop ways that would promote the safety and health of the residents. Also, the improvising of water and sanitation, roads and drainage, and electrification have already commenced in the informal settlements.
