Nairobi Acting Governor Ann Kananu on Saturday visited the home of the late former Nairobi County Assembly speaker, the late Alex Ole Magelo who died this morning at the  Nairobi Hospital. Kananu was flanked by Magelo's widow Lucy and their children. She was accompanied by Nairobi County Chief Officer, Public Service Management, Simon Ole Morintat and Deputy Majority Whip of the County Assembly Waithera Chege. Kananu said death had robbed Nairobi, the Maa Community and Kenya of a wonderful father figure, a humorous and gentle soul, who was always jovial and never harboured any ill feelings towards anyone and believed in resolving issues amicably. "I am deeply saddened by the sudden death of former Nairobi County Assembly Speaker, Alex Ole Magelo, who passed away while undergoing treatment. Mr  Magelo a former long-serving Councillor, was elected as the first Nairobi  County Assembly Speaker in 2013,"she said. "During his tenure he served the Legislative and Executive with a lot of dedication, diligence, kindness, wisdom and humility Mr Magelo, was an ardent football lover and previously served as the Chairman of AFC Leopards."
