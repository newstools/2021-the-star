The Media Council of Kenya has commended Radio Africa Group for terminating the services of three radio presenters at Homeboyz radio. Homeboyz Radio and its parent company, Radio Africa, terminated the service of Shaffie Weru, Joseph Munoru (DJ Mfalme) and Neville Muysa with immediate effect. The termination follows a comprehensive review of the comments made on the station on Thursday morning and their subsequent suspension from employment. "The Council takes note of the action taken by the management of the radio station, against the individuals and commends them for taking responsibility," CEO David Omwoyo said in a statement. "This is as a sign of commitment, to uphold ethical standards in their programming. Consequently, the Council will be keen on following up on such matters to enforce compliance as per the Media Council Act 2013." On Friday, the three were suspended for two weeks in relation to comments they made that appeared to victim shame and justify sexual assault against women. Homeboyz Radio General Manager Somoina Kimonjino said that investigations had determined that their conduct constitutes gross misconduct and an egregious breach of the companyâ€™s editorial policies. She assured all Homeboyz Radio partners and listeners across the country that the station was committed to ensuring that presenters and producers are regularly trained on media and gender issues, the ethics of reporting on issues of gender-based violence and sexual assault, inclusivity and diversity.
