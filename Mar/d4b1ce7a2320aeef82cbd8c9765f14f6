Those who wish to travel to or from counties under lockdown have until Sunday 8pm to do so, Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna has said. In a press briefing on Saturday, Oguna said the transition period is for Kenyans who may be stranded away from work places. "This is also for students who may want to travel home after the closure of schools," Oguna said. President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a cessation of all movement by road, train or air in and out of Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and Nakuru Counties until otherwise notified. He also directed immediate closure of all learning institutions as a move to curb the surging virus infections in the country. Uhuru on Friday said only students sitting the national examinations and those in medical training centres will be allowed to proceed with physical learning. Oguna said all travelers with flight and SGR tickets have until Monday 29 at 12pm to travel after which, all travels will be suspended. "Individuals who are holders of curfew passes will continue to use the old passes until new ones are issued by Tuesday next week. This applies to healthcare workers, and Journalists, among others," Oguna said. On specialized treatment Oguna said cases of individuals seeking treatment within the Zoned area will be addressed on a case by case basis upon proof of referral and obtaining clearance from the nearest Police Commander. "The same applies for transportation of caskets, which must be disposed of within 72 hours," he said.
