IEBC has said it will take action against Tabitha Mutemi for violating staff code of ethics to take up a position as a board member at the Media Council of Kenya. In a statement on Wednesday, Chairman Wafula Chebukati acknowledged that Mutemi was an IEBC employee but said they were not consulted on her appointment. "IEBC was was neither consulted nor notified of Mutemi's employment as a board member of MCK," he said. Chebukati said MCK  is at liberty to take appropriate action in accordance with relevant laws and procedures governing the council. "The commission will undertake action at an appropriate time in accordance with the IEBC act and HR manual," he said. The Kenya Editors’ Guild expressed its dissatisfaction with the continuing impasse over the attempted removal of the MCK board member. Kenya Editors’ Guild President Churchill Otieno said that any action that negatively impacts the integrity and independence of the media council is a threat to media freedom. This comes following the move taken by MCK CEO David Omwoyo to remove Mutemi from MCK Board. So far, Mutemi has challenged the purported removal and has threatened to sue, and has also written to the Speaker of the National Assembly and the relevant Departmental Committee. The organization has said that it will petition the National Assembly to urge them to ensure the protection of media freedom for the benefit of Kenyan citizens and their democratic rights.
