Tokyo Olympics-bound Shujaa and Lionesses face stern tests at next month's Emirates Dubai Invitational Sevens tournament slated. Innocent Simiyu charges, who finished second at Madrid Sevens last month, will renew rivalry with Argentina — who beat them thrice in the Spanish capital — France, Canada, Japan, Chile and neighbours Uganda. The Lionesses who blew hot and cold in Madrid face powerhouses, Canada, France, the USA, Japan and Brazil. Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu said he is expecting a tough outing in the Qatari capital. "The event will be tough. I believe all the teams have stepped up their game and want to be in the best possible condition before they go to the Olympics. We want to put our best forward,” said Simiyu. Shujaa will be seeking to go one step better having lost twice to Argentina in the final in Madrid, losing 45-7 and 21-14 with tour captain Nelson Oyoo observing that they learnt valuable lessons in Madrid. "We were rusty in some facets of play but I believe the more tournaments we get, the better we will be," said Oyoo. Shujaa have been in a 10-day residential training camp at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Kenya Lionesses team manager Camlyne Oyuayo said: "We are meeting some of the top teams in the world and it can only help us improve our performances from Madrid. The teams will train and play all rugby at The Sevens Stadium behind closed doors. The tournaments are accredited by World Rugby, with international referees and officials flying in to support as part of their own Olympic preparations.
