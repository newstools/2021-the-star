ANC, Ford Kenya and Wiper parties do not have enough MPs to qualify as parliamentary parties, nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has said. He said only Nasa coalition qualifies as a parliamentary party. Parties under Nasa coalition include ANC, Wiper, Ford Kenya and ODM. Osotsi of ANC said he pays his allegiance to Nasa leader Raila Odinga while in Parliament. The lawmaker said he is serving in three parliamentary committees courtesy of Nasa coalition. Osotsi challenged his colleagues in Nasa coalition, who are against the handshake, to resign from their positions. “Seek your positions under the One Kenya Alliance that I have heard is coming,” he said. The alliance brings together Kanu's Gideon Moi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula and Musalia Mudavadi of ANC. Osotsi spoke to the press at Kima during the inauguration of James Obunde as the new archbishop for East Africa Church of God. The lawmaker also said there is no need for ANC to seek consultation on Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala's removal as Senate deputy minority leader. “Malala signed an agreement to serve for two years as deputy minority party leader and Ledama Olekina to serve the remaining term,” he said. Efforts to reach Malala failed as he did not pick his calls or respond to text messages. Earlier this month, 20 ODM senators signed a petition to oust Malala managing to strip him of his position in the Senate. The lawmakers later held a parliamentary group meeting at Parliament Buildings, where they ratified the decision. Malala is accused of being disrespectful to Nasa co-principals including Kalonzo and ODM deputy party leader and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. The lawmakers picked Kilifi Senator Steward Madzayo to replace Malala in what was seen as a strategic move by Raila to consolidate the Kilifi support base.
