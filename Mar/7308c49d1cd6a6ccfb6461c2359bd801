No international fans will be permitted at the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics this summer because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, organisers say. Japanese authorities told the Olympic and Paralympic committees it was "highly unlikely" that entry to the country could be guaranteed. Organisers said the move would help ensure "a safe and secure Games for all participants and the Japanese public". The games are due to begin on July 23 and the Paralympics follow the Olympics a month later, from 24 August. Organiser said they had made the move to bar overseas spectators "to give clarity to ticket holders", who will be refunded. They added that the "challenging" Covid-19 situation in Japan and many other countries, global travel restrictions, and the emergence of variant strains of the virus had led to the decision. Organisers postponed the Olympics by a year in March last year because of the growing spread of coronavirus across the world.
