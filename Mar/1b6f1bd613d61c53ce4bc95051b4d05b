Recently there has been a viral Tortilla challenge all over social media so we had to give it a go, using chapatis instead of course. The recipe is super easy to make and is a great idea to shake up your left over chapatis and bits you have in your fridge. I had a blast making these because you can change up the fillings depending on the meal, and everyone in my house definitely enjoyed eating them so give them a go and let us know what you think. Breakfast Ingredients Cooked bacon Scrambled eggs Sliced tomatoes Cheese Method 1: Cut your chapati from the middle at the top to the middle of the chapati so you have a flap on one side. 2: Starting with your bacon, place it on the first quarter, followed by the eggs on the second quarter, tomatoes on the third and lastly cheese. 3: Again starting with the bacon side, fold each quarter over each other until you have a neat triangular wrap. 4: Heat up a panned grease with some butter, then toast each side of your chapati until it is nicely crispy and your cheese is nice and melted. Change up the fillings if you want, for lunch I used some roast chicken, Spinach, Onions and Cheese and for dinner we raised it up even more by combining steak, spinach, onions and tomatoes and cheese.
