Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said he has no plans of replacing compatriot Joachim Loew when he steps down as Germany boss after the European Championship in June-July. Loew is the current longest serving national team coach after taking the job in 2006 but the 61-year-old, who led Germany to the 2014 World Cup title, is ending his contract a year early. Klopp has three years to run on his current deal at Liverpool and said he had always honoured his contract in his previous roles at Mainz 05 and Borussia Dortmund. “Will I be available for the German national team job in the summer? No,” Klopp told reporters. “Loew did an incredible job for so many years, the longest servant we had in Germany. “I understand he wants to have this highlight at the European Championship... Somebody else will do the job and with the amount of really good German managers at the moment, the German FA will find a good solution.” Liverpool have lost eight times since January to drop from the Premier League summit to eighth in the standings.
