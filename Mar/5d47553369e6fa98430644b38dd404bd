United Democratic Alliance candidate for the Matungu parliamentary by-election Alex Lany has conceded defeat. The candidate supported by Deputy President William Ruto’s party lost to Peter Nabulindo of ANC. Lanya came third after Nabulindo and ODM’s David Were in the poll held on Thursday. Nabulindo garnered 14,257 votes while Were got 10,565 votes as Lanya  polled 5, 513 votes. “As the dust settles following the Matungu by-election, I wish to humbly concede defeat and congratulate the winner honourable Peter Oscar Nabulindo,” Lanya said. Lanya thanked the constituents for believing in him. “I wish to thank the UDA party leadership, the hustler nation and honourable members for believing in me, supporting me and standing with me through the campaign period,” he said. Lanya was seen as a serious contender for the seat after the DP’s party picked him as its candidate. Ruto deployed a team of politicians led by former Majority Whip Benjamin Washiali, former Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale and former Sports CS Rashid Echesa to campaign for Lanya. Lanya condemned the violence, voter bribery and intimidation that marred the election. “Matungu is greater than any one of us. I request the great people of Matungu to soldier on,” he said. “I will continue to serve the great people of Matungu and Kenya in other programmes for posterity.”
