Swamibapa’s Nehemiah Odhiambo is doubt for this Saturday’s match against Nairobi Gymkhana in the Nairobi Invitational Cricket League Twenty20 tourney. The Kenya sixth most capped Twenty20 international player sustained a knee injury two weeks ago in a clash against Ngara. The 37-year-old seamer, who skipped Swamibapa’s six-wickets loss to Kanbis at Eastleigh High School, however, allayed fears over his fitness ahead of the Gymkhana match at Sikh Union Club. “I have done whatever I can to get the best healing process and I generally feel good at the moment,” Odhiambo said. “I will keep bowling as I monitor my progress. If I will be fit to play by Thursday, then that’s great but if not, I will work towards our next match.” The club too has been following his progress and are delighted with the progress. “Odhiambo has been progressing well and he seems fine and reasonably jovial,” teammate Maurice Ouma confirmed. Odhiambo said his side must build on the feel-good factor created in the preliminary matches to progress into the second qualifier set for Sunday. “It’s a really exciting time for Swamibapa cricket. I think it was an amazing performance in the preliminaries and the reaction to it has been phenomenal,” he added. “It’s time to focus on Saturday’s match. We know the dangers Gymkhana teams bring when playing top sides and we must fully remain focused,” he said. “We can’t afford to hang on to the other results. It’s our job as Swamibapa cricketers to try and carry on the momentum and hopefully, a title win will do that.” Kanbis play Sir Ali Muslim in Eliminator One match at Nairobi Gymkhana and the winner of the match will progress straight into next Sunday’s final. The loser will play  the winner of Kanbis-Swamibapa tie to determine the other finalist.
