The ODM party has lauded some of Raila Odinga's political rivals who have sent out messages of goodwill to the former Prime Minister after he announced he has Covid-19. ODM National Treasurer Timothy Bosire welcomed the messages of quick recovery by key political leaders following the hospitalisation of the party leader. The former Kitutu Masaba MP said the "quick recovery" messages to the ODM leader, especially by his opponents, show that the politicians are humane. Speaking to the Star on the phone Bosire said the messages go a long way in demonstrating that despite the political differences, humanity is above everything. "Their goodwill messages serve to detoxify the politics given the way it was going. We are good together," Bosire said. Deputy President William Ruto and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi as well as Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka have sent messages of quick recovery to Raila following his admission at the Nairobi Hospital. Raila on Thursday tested positive for Covid-19 and has been quarantined at theÂ  facility as he undergoes treatment. Bosire emphasised that the messages from Raila's political rivals are a testimony that in politics there is nothing personal. "The statements by the leaders demonstrate that in politics there is no enmity and that all of us are human," Bosire said. In recent weeks Raila has clashed with Kalonzo and Musalia with his allies having accused the two of rocking the handshake through their emerging alliance ahead of 2022. But in a gesture of goodwill, the two have called for Raila's quick recovery with Ruto saying Kenyans were praying for the former Prime Minister.
