Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu has nominated Finance Minister Philip Isdor Mpango to be vice-president. Mr Mpango's nomination was announced by Parliament Speaker Job Ndugai ahead of the approval vote. Members of parliament applauded after his name was mentioned. The minister was last month seen in a viral video coughing during a press conference while paying tribute to senior government officials who had died of suspected Covid-19. Mr Mpango was among two ministers who were re-appointed by former President John Magufuli as he started his second term.
