Soy MP Caleb Kositany has accepted his removal as Jubilee's deputy secretary general. He however had a lot to say over the party's leadership and recent division. Kositany alleged that the party is led under dictatorship and members are in the dark on the important issues including the handshake and BBI. "Jubilee is just a forgotten story. It will not be there in 2022. It will shrink to a very small party like its friend KANU," Kositany said in an interview with Citizen TV on Monday. He added, "The vice chairman said the other day that I'll be removed today. You can see he is the mouthpiece." Kositany was replaced with Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny. In a letter dated March 1, secretary general Raphael Tuju said the decision was made after a National Management Committee meeting. When asked what he thought about his replacement, Kositany said, "He (Kutuny) is just going to be a yes person so don't expect anything from him." Kositany is a strong ally of Deputy President William Ruto, who has been on a collision course with his boss - President Uhuru Kenyatta. He is among nine aspirants who have declared interest in succeeding Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago on the ticket of the UDA Party linked to  Ruto.
