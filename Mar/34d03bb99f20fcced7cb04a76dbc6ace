When they said the only way to pursue development is to follow failed foreign financial institutions that have left Africa impoverished and debt, they did not see Magufuli coming. These were the words of Malawi president Lazarus Chakwera. Speaking at the funeral mass of the late Tanzania President John Pombe Magufuli, Chakwera said Magufuli was such an unpredictable person and he would not let anyone predict his next move. "Magufuli was Africa's finest son and no one saw it coming. This ability not to let anyone predict his next move is what we should find inspiring," he said. According to Chakwera, in the last 160 days, he was invited to a state dinner in Dar es Salaam by the late president. "I did not know it would be our last supper. He saw me off at the Julius Nyerere International airport not knowing that it would his last goodbye," he said. Chakwera said Magufuli was dedicated to ensuring that the public service sector gave out the best of its services to the public. "When they said laziness in public service cannot be cured, they did not see Magufuli coming. When they said cartels of corruption cannot be defeated, they did not see it coming. When they said African states cannot become middle-income economies in the first term of presidency, they did not see Magufuli coming," Chakwera said. He added, "When they said infrastructure projects in Africa cannot be completed on time and in the budget, they did not see Magufuli coming". Chakwera said to those who had the privileged of knowing how Magufuli was, the examples of his life service shall live with them. "His life is that which will move other African leaders from complacency. He was not just an icon but a hero whose resolve shall create a symbol of Africa we all want,' Chakwera said. He said Magufuli's love for his country shall forever be an anchorage for all Tanzanians.
