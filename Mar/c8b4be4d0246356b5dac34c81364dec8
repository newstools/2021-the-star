Kenya Airways has added more flight capacity ahead of Monday deadline when domestic flights will be suspended in five counties. This comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a cessation of all movement by road, train or air in and out of Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and Nakuru Counties until otherwise notified. This is a move the government has chosen to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the country. The National Carrier increased the number of flights between Nairobi to Mombasa and Nairobi to Kisumu. Today, KQ will have four flights - two flights from Nairobi to Mombasa and Mombasa to Nairobi. The flights from Nairobi to Mombasa will leave at 1Pm to 2pm. The one leaving Mombasa will depart from 14:50pm to 15:50pm. The second one from Nairobi will leave at 5pm to 6pm and leave Mombasa at 18:50pm to 19:50pm. On Sunday, the Kenya Airways will have five flights plying Nairobi to Mombasa. The earliest flight will be from 8am while the latest will leave Nairobi at 5pm. Only three flights will leave Mombasa for Nairobi on the same day. On Monday, there will be two flights from Nairobi to Mombasa and two others from Mombasa to Nairobi. KQ said passengers affected by the suspension of domestic flight can reschedule their bookings or request a refund. Tourism CS Najib Balala announced that both domestic and international tourists who need to go back home via Nairobi have until March 29 mid-day to be in Nairobi. Domestic flights will cease from March 29, 2021 mid day in the five counties. "Tourists who are in transit into the country and are scheduled to visit offerings out of Nairobi can only do so until Monday 29 mid-day. Post that date, they will only be confined into Nairobi," Balala said.
