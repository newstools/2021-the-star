The Coast Water Works Development Agency chief executive officer Jacob Torrut’s has been sent on terminal leave, pending his retirement in May this year. A board meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters in Mombasa resolved to appoint Technical Manager Martin Tsuma as acting CEO. Torrut was first appointed on May 5, 2017. Coast Water Works Development Agency board chairperson Omar Boga confirmed Torrut’s departure from the institution. Boga, the ODM party candidate who lost in the Msambweni by-election in December last year, was appointed chairperson of Coast Water on February 26 this year. “That position will now be advertised and the recruitment exercise begins,” Boga said of the CEO's job. He said Torrut had asked for an extension of his term, but the board rejected the request. A source within the agency said Boga was scheduled to have a meeting with all the staff on Thursday. Boga, who has taken over for a three-year term, is said to be planning to streamline activities at the parastatal. Torrut’s term at the institution has been a roller coaster, as he was suspended in 2018 for gross misconduct and insubordination but was reinstated. In 2018, during the reign of Sureya Hersi as Coast water board chairperson, Torrut fell out with the board. During that time, the board appointed Tsuma in an acting capacity, however, Torrut defied the directive and went about his duties. Instead of handing over to Tsuma, Torrut appointed procurement officer Stanslus Jira to take charge while he was away. Several weeks after his suspension, Water Principal Secretary Joseph Irungu rescinded the decision by the board to suspend Torrut.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
