Mathare United head coach Salim Ali yesterday blasted his players for putting up a dismal performance following their 2-0 loss to Nairobi City Stars in a Football Kenya Federation Premier League (FKF-PL) at the Kasarani Annex. The 2008 league champions fell to the league returnees who netted through Bolton Omwenga and Rodgers Okumu— a result which left them slightly hovering above the red line thus provoking Salim’s anger. The soft-spoken tactician minced no words as he read riot act to his playing unit for their colourless show which saw them stretch their losses to six out of the 11 matches this season. The former player at the club described the game as one of the worst he had watched from his charges since joining the coaching ranks. “I am disappointed with the way my players have played today. We played poorly compared to their show against Wazito. This is the second worst game I have ever seen after the Bidco game. It is gut wrenching when you give a player everything in training and ends up repaying with such a performance,” he said Besides criticising the performance, the former Ulinzi Stars coach tore into the team for keeping a paltry three clean-sheets in eleven matches. “It concerns me when we don’t score and end up conceding. We have been letting in cheap goals due to lapses in concentration,” he rued. To arrest the poor run, Salim promised to ring changes before their next match against Kakamega Homeboyz this weekend. “ There will be changes before we play our next game,” he revealed. While Salim was left with a bitter taste in his mouth, his City Stars counterpart Sanjin Alagic was impressed with his team after registering their third successive win catapulted them eighth with 19 points. “We have in the past three matches played poorly but I am happy we have been taking our chances. We are still taking one game at a time, a strategy which is working for us so far,” he said.
