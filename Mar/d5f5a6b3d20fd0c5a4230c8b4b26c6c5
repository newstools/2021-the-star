Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has tested positive for coronavirus, Health CEC Misheck Mutuma has said. The CEC said that the governor is currently in isolation, adding that the county has been experiencing a surge in cases. During a press briefing on Friday, the CEC said that the number of Covid-19 cases continues to increase. He said that by the end of January, only two patients were in isolation and the number has increased to 137, out of which 79 are under Home-Based Care. The CEC added that the governor is doing well in isolation and will be back soon. The residents have also been urged to adhere to Covid-19 protocols in order to reduce further infection. “I want to advise all the people of Meru to take all the precautionary measures given out by the department of health. Let us always wash our hands with soap and water, wear our masks and keep social distance in all the places,” Mutuma said. On Monday last week, Kiraitu received the AstraZeneca jab and urged Meru people not to listen to lies and propaganda to reject the vaccine. The county's frontline health workers started receiving the jab at Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital as Kiraitu rallied leaders behind the vaccine. Kiraitu received the Covid-19 jab on Monday but lamented that some politicians had deceived locals with rumours and falsehoods that the vaccine is not safe. He said the vaccine was safe. “Certain MPs in this region are creating fear about the vaccine. I have been watching and listening to discomforting news from politicians casting doubt on the vaccine's safety. The vaccine undergoes rigorous processes and tests before it’s released for use,” Kiraitu said. Meru is targeting to inoculate 3,000 people in the first phase of the drive with about 6,000 doses, the officer in charge of the exercise, Hallan Mururu, said.
