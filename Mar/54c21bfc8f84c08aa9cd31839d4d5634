The county government of Kitui is planning to carry out sensitisation campaigns to demystify the myths and misinformation surrounding the Covid-19 vaccine. Health executive Winnie Kitetu said the opposition to the vaccine by a section of the population stemmed from undue anxiety and fear of the unknown. She said since the first Covid-19 case was reported in the country one year ago, 788 Kitui residents have been infected and 23 have died from the disease. Kitetu spoke on Wednesday at the Kitui County Referral Hospital when she officiated the roll-out of the vaccination. She said all the 1,780 healthcare staff and other workers in health facilities across the county will be inoculated. Kitui, she said, has received 9,000 doses, which will go a long way in protecting residents against Covid-19. Kitetu was the first person to receive the Covid-19 jab. Others who were vaccinated were acting Health chief officer Kioko Kiilu and director of health services Dr Allan Owino. She said by the end of June all targeted health workers, security officers and teachers would have been vaccinated.
