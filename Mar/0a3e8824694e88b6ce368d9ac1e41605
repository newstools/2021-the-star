Kenyans have been warned against buying electronics from dealers with no fixed address. In a series of tweets on Saturday, DCI George Kinoti said the address must beÂ  an identifiable trading premises with requisite authorization documents that are conspicuously displayed, including licenses, permits and other local and/or national approvals. "Whenever buying, insist on issuance of a receipt clearly itemizing the particulars of the bought gadget," he said. He said Kenyans should always keep the receipt or secure it electronically by photographing and archiving it in a reliable system. "It is Risky and dangerous to buy any electronic device from suspicious outlets. Most are those who buy stolen items from armed gangsters who have violently robbed innocent citizens, and in the process killed or maimed them," he said. "Don't buy a device of a fellow murdered or maimed Kenyan." Kinoti said if detectives forensically investigate and find you in possession of such said devices, you suffer immediate consequences of the actual criminal, which may escalate to Death sentences. "We further urge electronic dealers to seize the ICT technology and ensure they mark, at the counter, every electronic gadget bought by a customer as a value added incentive with indelible initials as may please the customer for security purposes," he said. This makes it hard for criminals to hawk it and easier for investigative agencies to track and identify. Equally, owners can mark in the same manner through various private experts in the market. In case of any doubt that you may be harbouring any gadget of suspicious source, please and in confidence report at any Police Station or DCI Office.
