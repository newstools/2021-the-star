Pastor Ng'ang'a has opposed the move by the government to again target churches in its fight against Covid-19. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday suspended gatherings at places of worship in five counties to limit the spread of the virus. Speaking to Word Is, the Neno Evangelism ministry leader said the government needs to consider that God is still the first option people should take whenever there is a pandemic. “In 2007, people ran to church to seek for comfort. But right now, naona wameanza kushikanisha bar na kanisa. Kanisa sio walevi wako huko. They are people who can control themselves.” He says the government has allowed the matatus to continue operating yet churches are more spacious and orderly. “My message is that people should not forget God. Empty you came and empty you will go. No matter how rich you are.” Pastor Nganga has been camping in Kajiado ever since the Covid-19 pandemic began. He has built a huge city-like place for himself and his worshipers and branded it Jerusalem city. He said he wants to leave a positive legacy in Kenya by building a megachurch in Kajiado and the capital city. “I have started building another church in Kajiado, which will look like Jerusalem city,” he said. “The pandemic has not affected me as I am still serving God and building God's house, not a kiosk. It is the house of the Lord and it is built by the few appointed.”
