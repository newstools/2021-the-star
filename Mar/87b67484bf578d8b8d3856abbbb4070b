Former Sports CS Rashid Echesa was on Thursday caught on video slapping an IEBC official at Bulonga polling station in Matungu. This happened as he accused IEBC official Peter Okura of barring their agent to witness the voting. "Sheria inasema kuwa poll agents must witness the voting!" he was heard shouting as he told off the IEBC agent. In the not so audible video, the IEBC agent was heard defending himself saying that he was following instructions. But before he could finish talking, Echesa slapped him. "You were told by who? Umeambiwa by who? You cannot keep our agents outside. Why are you chasing them outside.... This is stupidity my friend..." Echesa says as he slaps the official. Okura allegedly stopped one of United Democratic Allianceâ€™s agents from entering the polling venue because he did not have a facemask. The by-election has attracted 15 candidates, among them 9 independents, including Murunga's widow Christabel Amunga and son Eugene Ambwere. Other candidates in the race are Charles Kasamani of the United Democratic Party, Paul Achayo MDG and Faida Auma of Maendeleo Chap Chap and independents; Bernard Wakoli, Athman Wangara, Anzelimo Kongoti, Kevin Nectus, Wilberforce Lutta and Gregory Atoko. The by-election's outcome will have a direct bearing on key politicians positioning for the 2022 succession race.
