ANC has dared ODM to bring on the petition challenging the election of Matungu MP Oscar Nabulindo. Led by Lugari MP Ayub Savula, the lawmakers said they are ready to faceoff with ODM in court as they defend their win in this month's by-elections. Savula said they won fair and square and urged the Raila Odinga-led party to bring on their threats. "We as ANC we shall put on a brave face. We are ready for the petition any minute any day" Savula said. The Mp added that ODM's petition "is the last kick of a dying horse." Savula was accompanied by among others Tindi Mwale (Butere), Senator Cleophas Malala (Kakamega) Peter Nabulindo (Matungu), nominated Senator Patronila Were, and Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya) among others. Nabulindo won the seat on an Amani National Congress ticket, trouncing ODM’s David Were with a margin of about 4,000 votes. But in a quick rejoinder, ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna dismissed the lawmakers saying the dirty tricks used in Matungu will soon be exposed in court. “They have panicked because they know there is no way that election can pass the test of a free and fair election. It is telling that up to now the ANC and its party leader who tries to portray himself as "Mr. Clean" are yet to condemn the violence meted out on innocent wananchi by their goons,” Sifuna said. Sifuna added that “ In fact, Musalia has publicly praised Malala and endorsed violence as a tool of electoral success. They will be undressed in court.”
