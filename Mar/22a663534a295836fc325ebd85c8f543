President Uhuru Kenyatta is Friday expected to address the nation on the Covid-19 situation and review the containment measures a day after the highest cases were reported since January. On Thursday, 829 people tested positive for the coronavirus. This was a positivity rate of 13.2 per cent. The figure was higher on Wednesday with 13.6 per cent.  A total of 6,239 tests were conducted in 24 hours. The virus caseload on Thursday evening was 111,185 from 1,352,126 cumulative tests. Data from the Health Ministry showed that 91 patients were in ICU on Thursday, up from 89 on Wednesday. “Even as we increase the sample size to a minimum of 7,000 having received the necessary reagents the sheer number itself tells you the whole story,” Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said on Wednesday. “I, therefore, want to support and agree with CoG that now the time has come to start looking back at some of the measures that we have taken whether to increase and to stop and make some mandatory requirements of our population.” On Thursday, 22 cases were on ventilator support, 60 on supplemental oxygen and nine under observation. Another 28 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen with 26 of them in the general wards and two in the high dependency unit. One more patient succumbed to the virus, raising the fatalities to 1,899. Some 566 patients were admitted to various health facilities countrywide while 1,694 were on home-based care. The Council of Governors meeting in Nairobi on Wednesday raised the alarm that the ongoing political rallies were fuelling the virus. They urged the President to enforce a ban on all rallies for another period of 30 days to allow for the flattening of the curve. “I wish to bring to your attention that we are currently dealing with the third wave of the virus which is severe. In this regard, the CoG together with the Ministry of Health will relook at the existing protocols with a view to containing the current wave,” CoG chair Martin Wambora said. Nairobi recorded 407 new cases followed by Kiambu with 82, Machakos with 81, Meru with 49, Nakuru 43, Uasin Gishu 26, Busia 20, Embu 18, Mombasa 17, Kajiado 14, Tharaka Nithi nine while Laikipia and Nyandarua had eight cases each. Other counties with new cases on Thursday include Kakamega and Kilifi with seven, Bungoma and Kisumu with five each, Homa Bay four, Murang’a, Makueni three, Kisii, Kitui, Migori, Nandi and Nyeri two while Trans Nzoia, Vihiga and Elgeyo Marakwet had one case each.
