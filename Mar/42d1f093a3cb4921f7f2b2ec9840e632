Nigeria singer Burna Boy and Wizkid have won Grammys in the 63rd edition of the annual awards. Burna Boy won the Best Global Music Album category while Wizkid won the Best Music Video for his song with Beyoncé, Brown Skin Girl, from Lion King: The Gift album. Beyoncé's daughter Blue Ivy also won a Grammy for her role on the song. Speaking after the win, Wizkid shared a video on his social media platforms handles saying; "To any African out there just know that no matter what you plan to achieve, you can achieve coz you are a king no matter where you are." Burna Boy, a nominee for a second consecutive year, won with his Twice as Tall album. The Grammy Awards were held in Los Angeles. There was no audience in this year's ceremony, and performers were on five stages, arranged in a circle inside the Los Angeles Convention Center to maintain social distancing. Burna Boy beat four others, including the Malian band Tinariwen. He was nominated in the same category in 2019 - then known as Best World Music Album - but lost to Angelique Kidjo.
