Karen MCA David Mberia who was convicted last month for receiving a Sh 1.7 Million bribe may lose his seat. This is after the High Court declined to set aside orders of the trial court that barred him from holding public office. The trial court directed that the judgment be served on the speaker of the county assembly for action. Mberia wanted a stay of the execution of the sentence pending the hearing of his application. But in her ruling, Justice Mumbi Ngugi said she would not issue any orders at this stage "At this stage of the proceedings, and bearing in mind that I have not heard the parties substantively I am not satisfied that the circumstances of the case merit grant of orders," the judge said. Mberia had argued that the EACC had already communicated to the speaker with the aim of removing him from office He was sentenced to three years in jail or an alternative fine of Sh700,000. He chose to pay the fine. The case will be heard on March 22. Milimani chief magistrate Thomas Nzioki ruled that Mberia was not fit to hold or access his office as an MCA. In his judgment, he said the charge was proved through the testimony of the investigating officer. The court also noted that Mberia was found with treated money and dismissed his allegations of being framed. The court observed that he was a first-time offender and a leader. Through his lawyers, however, Mberia pleaded for lenient sentencing, saying he was a family man and the sole breadwinner. But the prosecution said being an MCA, he failed the integrity test by committing the offence. He is a state officer and he is mandated to observe integrity under the Constitution. The court, however, acquitted Mberia's co-accusedâ€”MCAs Jared Okode (Mathare) and Abraham Mwangi (Woodley).
