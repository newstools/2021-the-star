Quins coach Antoine Plasman is seeking improvement from his charges after a come-from-behind victory over neighbours Impala in an entertaining Ngong Road Derby on Saturday. The topsy-turvy game saw Quins finally registered their first win of the season after beating Impala 27-20. “I'm delighted with the win but we have to minimise our errors and avoid falling behind. I am happy with the bonus point but we must go back to the drawing board. Our next match is against Kabras and we have to be sharper against them,” said Belgian tactician. Plasman hailed the forwards for laying the platform for the victory. "We were able to dominate the contact areas. Our scrum and line-out were good and we need to build on that going forward,” he added. Plasman now hopes the team can kick in the remaining fixtures as they eye a place in the playoffs come the end of the season. "We now need to be consistent going forward,  minimise on our error rate and go flat out to make the playoffs,” added Plasman. Hooker Brian Waraba posted a brace with flanker Kevin Angote and Phillip Ikambili scoring one try each. Ervin Asena kicked over two conversions and Xavier Kipng'etich added a penalty. Impala scored their tries through Eric Kerre, Edmund Anya and Anderson Oduor with Martin Juma adding a penalty and a conversion. Impala led 10-7 at the interval. In other fixtures, Blak Blad winger Archadius Kwesa scored 11 points as Blak Blad stunned Mwamba 24-17 at the same venue. This was the students' first win of the season after drawing with Menengai Oilers last weekend. Brian Kadenge and Brian Wahinya scored a try apiece for the Thika road outfit. Mwamba replied through Jeremy Chimwani, Nicholas Kato and Joel Inzuga with Charles Kuka kicking over a conversion and a penalty. Menengai Oilers went top of the table with a hard-fought 21-20 win over Nakuru RFC in the city derby.
