Karen MCA David Mberia, who was convicted last month for receiving a Sh1.7 million bribe, may lose his seat. This is after the High Court declined to set aside orders of the trial court which barred him from holding public office. The trial court directed that the judgement be served upon the Speaker of the County Assembly to act on. Mberia wanted a stay of the execution of the sentence pending hearing of his application. In her ruling on Thursday, Justice Mumbi Ngugi said she would not issue any orders at this stage. "At this stage of the proceedings, and bearing in mind that I have not heard the parties substantively I am not satisfied that the circumstances of the case merit grant of orders," the judge ruled. Mberia had argued that EACC had already communicated to the Speaker with the aim of removing him from office. He had been sentenced to three years in jail or an alternative fine of Sh700,000. The case will be heard on March 22.
