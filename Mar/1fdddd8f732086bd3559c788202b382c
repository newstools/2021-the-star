More that 1.1 million Std 8 pupils begin their KCPE exams today and will write their last paper on Thursday. On the other hand, 751,150 Form 4 candidates start their exams on Thursday. Both candidates are a very disadvantaged lot. They lost a whole year following the outbreak of Covid-19 and when they resumed, the school term was compressed to cover for the lost time. Many students and teachers were not physically and physiologically prepared upon the resumption of learning. Some were victims of the disease, while others lost parents, relatives and friends to the pandemic. Some also had their parents or guardians lose their jobs or businesses. While some students had the advantage of going on with virtual classes,  others were reduced to herding cattle, and fetching firewood and water during the long break. The playing ground for the candidates is thus greatly uneven. We hope the Ministry of Education and Knec have put all these factors into consideration in the preparation and the setting of the exams. The exams must, therefore, be marked with all these in mind to ensure those adversely disadvantaged by the pandemic  fail to further their education because of a rigid marking system. We at the Star wish the candidates all the best.
