Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has asked politicians to accord President Uhuru Kenyatta ample time to finish his term Moi said it is unfortunate that some politicians especially those within Uhuru's camp are doing what they can to frustrate the head of state. Speaking in Gitrhunguri where he attended a church service, Moi said sabotaging the president adds no value but rather frustrates his agenda to deliver to Kenyans. "Let us give Uhuru time to finish his work, Let him complete his agenda because his term ends in August 2022. In the near future, the field will be open for all of us but for now, it is his time," the Senator said. Moi said he toured the region to rekindle the friendship his late father Daniel Moi enjoyed with the residents. "I am here today because my father had special memories of this place. You helped him achieve his agenda. That same friendship is what I have come to seek," he said. Moi said though some politicians have already embarked on the 2022 campaign trail, they should not take advantage to frustrate Uhuru's agenda. While drumming up support for the BBI referendum, Moi asked the residents to fully rally behind the calls. He said the County Assemblies have done their beat and now all eyes are focused on the National Assembly and the Senate. "The two houses have promised to fast-track and do their beat. We shall then go for halftime and allow you citizens to read the document and make an informed decision," he said. Moi said politicians can only talk about the document and alert ordinary citizens to prepare. "When that day comes, please make your informed decision basing on what you would have analysed. All we can do as ;leaders is to alert you to prepare," he said.
