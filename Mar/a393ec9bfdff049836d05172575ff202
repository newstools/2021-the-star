Vihiga United t tactician Sammy Okoth has urged his players to up their game and ensure they survive relegation from the Football Kenya Federation-Premier League . He said it will be difficult to make a comeback in the top tier once they are relegated hence they will need to do everything within their power to ensure they evade the chop. “What we need to focus on now is to avoid relegation; nothing else,” Okoth noted. Vihiga United are currently in position 16 on KPL log, having won only two matches since making their comeback in the league. They are expected to face AFC Leopards on March 20th at Mumias Complex. On the other hand, Leopards are placed third with 28 points from 13 matches. Okoth admitted that they have had it rough at Vihiga since the departure of strikers Alex Imbusia  and David Simiyu, who joined Sofapaka and KCB  respectively. “Most of the time, I am forced to rely on attacking midfielders for goals and this has affected us,” he said. Okoth said the new players who were recruited to the club are picking up steadily  and with time, they will be back on their feet.  The coach's sentiments comes in the wake of county officials urging the club management to seek  alternative funding to cater their budget. Vihiga County Sports CEC, Philip Gavuna recently noted that there was no way they can provide for the entire budget of Sh40 million.
