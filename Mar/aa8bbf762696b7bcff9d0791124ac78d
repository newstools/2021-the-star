Gichugu legislator Gichimu Githinji has told leaders allied to the ODM party to leave Interior PS Karanja Kibicho alone. The ODM members have been castigating Kibicho over his involvement in the BBI campaigns and handshake popularisation. Speaking in Gichugu, Githinji said the PS should not resign as the ODM brigade has been advocating for. He said Kibicho is a technocrat who is fulfilling all obligations given to him by the government. “He is appointed by the President and as county leaders, we support him and are proud of his work,” Githinji said. He said there are only two PSs in the county that play a critical role in the development of the county. “As county leaders we hold Kibicho and Infrastructure PS Paul Maringa in high regard as they hold our hands whenever we want to reach to various government offices that are key to fulfilling the wishes of our people,” Githinji said. ODM led by Suna East MP Junet Mohammed and Siaya Senator James Orengo has accused the PS of meddling in BBI process. They say he is causing confusion while overstepping his mandate. They further threatened that ODM could pull out of the handshake if the official will not keep off BBI politics. Githinji cited various roads within Gichugu and Mwea that have come through thanks to the assistance of the PSs. “Since 2018 the two constituencies have been drafting 50 kilometres of roads. Here in Gichugu, we purpose to have a road that will connect to all areas,” he said. Githinji said they were told to work on the drafts because no leader in those two constituencies requested for the establishment of roads between 2013 and 2017.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
