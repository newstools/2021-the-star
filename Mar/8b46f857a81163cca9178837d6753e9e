Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga's led government has kicked off the process of elevating 10 urban centres in Siaya county to town status. According to a communication by the county's Lands chief officer Walter Okello to the sub county administrators of Ugunja, Gem, Ugenya and Bondo, the county government has already initiated the process of delineation of boundaries and conferring the ten areas with town status. "In support of this process, the county government intends to establish interim committees whose membership will be drawn from various stakeholders, including residents of the respective urban centres," he said. The interim committees will be charged with the management of the urban areas and addressing emerging challenges, according to Okello. He said the decision is based on the county's rapid urbanisation, with resultant impact on available resources and infrastructure. "Consequently, urban challenges are evident in most of the areas, hence need for elaborate urban management system," he said. Urban areas targeted for elevation to town status include Bondo, Yala, Ugunja, Sigomre, Akala, Ndori, Aram, Nyadorera, Usenge and Ukwala. The chief officer said that the department of lands will soon start sensitisation forums to appraise residents of these areas on the planned establishment of the committees. The forums will address issues relating to membership of the committees, criteria and application for nomination and appointment of members as well as their respective mandate . "Participants will be picked from youth and women groups, boda boda Saccos, residents associations, informal groupings, special interest groups, professional bodies and political parties among other stakeholders," he said.
