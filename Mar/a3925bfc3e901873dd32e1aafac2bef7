Speaker Justin Muturi was on Saturday installed by the Njuri Nceke council of elders as Mt Kenya spokesman. The speaker was coronated in an elaborate event attended by hundreds of elders, largely from his Mt Kenya backyard. This prepares him to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022. He is the fifth leader to be installed by Njuri Nceke, being Kenya's first president Jomo Kenyatta, former President Mwai Kibaki, President Kenyatta, and Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi. Elders and political leaders from the region have been laying ground for Muturi's bid for presidency in 2022. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya is at the event. The Star established that those backing the speaker are also going flat out to package him as a 2022 presidential candidate. The idea is that the 64-year-old speaker is "a safe pair of hands to bring the community together'. Muturi has been approached by the Njuri Nceke Council of Elders, the Kiama Kiama Kikuyu Council of Elders, the Embu and Mbeere Cultural Elders, as well as religious leaders. Several MPs, not only from the speakerâ€™s Mt Kenya East backyard but also from other counties in Central, have joined the push. The feeling is that it is time their 'cousins from the West' returned a helping hand and supported a leader from the East. The Star has further learned that Speaker Muturi has been busy lately, ostensibly buoyed by the pressure to vie for kingpin - at least.
