Members of the minority Ilchamus community are up in arms over what they term discrimination in boundaries delimitation which has cost them elective positions. Twelve members who filed a class action against the state now want an order compelling IEBC to demarcate the boundaries of community land belonging to them and register the same as community land. Also sought is an order compelling the state to ensure that at least 8.35 per cent of the electoral and appointive positions in Baringo County Assembly and government is occupied by the Ilchamus. The Ilchamus also known as Tiamus, Njamusi or Njemps are a distinct indigenous socio-cultural Maa speaking group that settled on the islands of Lake Baringo in the 18th century. Prior to the delimitation of counties and wards by IEBC in 2012, they fell within Baringo Central Constituency which had 23 wards out of which five were occupied by the Ilchamus. The 23 wards were under the administration of 54 councillors out of which only four were llchamus. The remainder of Baringo Central was occupied by members of Tugen and Pokot communities. And following delimitation of boundaries, Baringo South Constituency was allocated to four electoral wards namely Mukutani, Marigat, Mochongoi and Ilchamus. However, members of Ilchamus have complained that they have been victims of cattle rustling by neighbouring communities of Pokot and Tugen. They believe it is their right to be protected but the national government has failed to stop the rustling and burning of their properties. They now want the state to be compelled to deploy adequate law enforcement resources in Baringo to combat the rustling.
