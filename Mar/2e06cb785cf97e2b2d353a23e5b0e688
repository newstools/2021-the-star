by WANGECHI WANG'ONDU  Neglected senior citizens in Kirinyaga county will from June be housed by the national government in a modern facility in Mwea subcounty. Officials Thursday said elderly people with no caregivers will be enlisted to be taken care of at the rescue home. The home has been built at a cost of Sh47 million in Ngurubani town. Director in the State Department of Social Protection Lissel Mogaka said 45 people will be admitted to the facility in June when the facility starts operations. That will be the first phase of the admissions. Kirinyaga was chosen to pilot the project before it is rolled out countrywide. Mogaka visited the institution in the company of a delegation from the department. He said such plans were informed after research indicated that many elderly people were suffering due to abandonment after their children migrated to the urban centers. He said some elderly citizens were being subjected to miserable lives through various forms of abuse. Mogaka said those to be admitted at the homes will pay a little fee for maintenance for the period they will be taken care of. The homes will serve as rescue centers for the abandoned and abused elderly persons. “The senior citizens, once in this home. will receive maximum care to make them feel comfortable,” Mogaka said. He urged local leaders to support the project. Kirinyaga Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri praised the initiative terming it the best gift the elderly would receive during such challenging times. “This home will be a second home and the best center for the occupants. They will receive the care they are lacking out there,” Ndambiri said. “It’s my request that the locals here make full utilisation of this facility.” Each occupant will be assigned a self-contained room at the center and their relatives will be allowed to visit.
