Popular comedian Inspekta Mwala says he is enjoying retirement months after resigning from his job at Radio Citizen. In an interview with Mzazi M Tuva, Mwala says there is life beyond being on radio. "I was on the radio because it’s a passion I have had for a long time. When I resigned people were shocked because they thought I would always be on radio. But there is life beyond that." While announcing his exit in December, he said he was leaving on good terms after 13 years at the station and looking to take a break as well as spend more time with his family, particularly his grandmother. However, he said he has no plans of leaving his famous drama show, 'Inspekta Mwala', in which he is the main actor. "If I was to leave the show, it would automatically die as it’s based on me as an Inspekta," he said. "We have talked with fellow actors in the show and agreed that in the meantime, they will put their things in order and invest. "Unajua hii yangu ni talent, currently I'm just doing things normal civilians do. I am enjoying my retirement, I wake up when I want and do what I want."
