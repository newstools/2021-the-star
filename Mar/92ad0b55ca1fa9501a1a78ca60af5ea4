Impala, Mwamba and Nondies have made a hasty retreat and will now play in the Kenya Cup, starting this weekend. The three clubs, who have 26 Kenya Cup titles between them, had objected to the season kickoff last month due to inadequate preparations. The clubs had argued that they needed an extensive pre-season training and strength/conditioning phase, which usually runs for eight to 10 weeks prior to the  season kickoff. Homeboyz have opted out of this season's competition due to financial difficulties after a stellar campaign last season, where they looked on course to win both the Kenya Cup and Enterprise Cup. The return of the three clubs means the league format will have to change from  round robin to the playoff with the top four teams qualifying for the semis and finals to be played in May. Impala will open their title campaign in a mouth-watering Ngong Road derby showdown against neighbours Quins on Saturday at the Impala Club. Quins have lost their two opening fixtures, losing 39-13 to Menengai Oilers and 35-32 to KCB. Mwamba face Blak Blad at the same venue on the same day in a doubleheader with Menengai Oilers taking on Nakuru in a Rift valley derby.  Kabras, Strathmore, KCB and Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology(MMUST) will rest this weekend. Nondies will start their season with a tricky tie against Strathmore Leos on March 20. Impala vice chairman Charles Ngovi welcomed the decision for the club to start their fixtures this weekend. “We started our training in January. Normally, you require eight to ten weeks of pre-season and starting the league last month was not in our best interests,"  added Ngovi. He said the club will be ready to mount a challenge for the title, “ The boys are in good shape and and we hope to be competitive,” added Ngovi. All Kenya Cup matches will be played behind closed doors in line with Covid-19 regulations from the Ministry of Health.
