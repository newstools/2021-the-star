 Residents of Magenche in Kisii have protested against spiralling cattle theft incidents in the area. They want the government to come to their aid and end the crime. The villagers say more than ten incidents of cattle rustling have been reported in the last three months, sparking fear among them. They suspect some people among them are collaborating with rustlers from the neighbouring Transmara in the Rift Valley to steal the cows at night. Group leader Ayub Manyange told journalists they “want this madness to end once for all”. “We especially urge Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to send his officers here,” he said. At Mariba village, the epicentre of the cattle theft, affected families recounted huge losses following the wave of cattle theft. They said many of the hoof prints are being traced to Transmara in Narok and want police to collaborate in apprehending the suspects. “We want the government to ensure we get back our cattle,” Manyange said. The villagers spoke of the risk of following up the stolen cows into the neighbouring region at night without the help of the police. “It is very sad when someone wakes up to find his only source of livelihood has been taken away,” Manyange said. Kenyenya deputy county commissioner David Mbevi said they are investigating some individuals suspected of abetting the theft. He said they would collaborate with security agencies from Transmara to apprehend other suspects from the region. “We have already started engaging members of the two communities to help identify those involved in cattle theft and ensure they are apprehended and taken to court,” Mbevi said.
