A senior police officer sustained gunshot wounds on Thursday night as he led a contingent of police officers, in responding to a scene of crime in Isebania, Migori county. The DCI has stated that the officers, who were responding to the distressing wails and screams of victims under attack, came under a hail of bullets as they stormed Mairi Complex where the robbery had been staged. Unbeknownst to the officers, a five-man gang that was armed to the teeth with all manner of weapons had staged a robbery within the complex, maiming and robbing businessmen off their hard earned cash. "A fierce shootout then ensued pitting the officers against the robbers. However, the assailants’ feeble fire was no match to the officers’ ferocious barrage of fire and like cornered rats, they scampered into different directions leaving traces of blood from their injuries," DCI said. "The assailants had already inflicted head injuries to a shopkeeper namely Hassan Osman and his customer Mohammed Ismail using machetes," DCI further communicated. The assailants were however rushed to BNM Hospital in Isebania by well wishers, where they are currently undergoing treatment. The heroic officer of the night, Inspector Daniel Karani Muriungi who led the onslaught and sustained gunshot wounds, was also treated and discharged in fair condition. A contingent of officers drawn from Migori is on the trail of the suspects. Scenes of Crime Personnel are combing through the scene collecting samples to help in identifying the authors of the crime.
