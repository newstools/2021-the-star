A cleric has urged the government to roll out a vibrant Covid-19 vaccination programme to reach all citizens in the shortest time possible. He also faulted some of the measures announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta last Friday to curb the spread of Covid-19. National Council of Churches of Kenya Western region vice chairman Bishop Sinema Pamba on Monday said imposing abrupt restriction of movement measures in and out five counties declared "disease-infected zone", has created a new crisis. “It is clear to everybody that our problem is not the absence of the restrictions but rather in the enforcement of the stipulated protocols,” he said in Kakamega town. He further urged county governments to provide a conducive environment for investment to alleviate poverty in the populace. Pamba said they are committed to eradicating poverty by mobilising community members to hold leaders to account by demanding justice and good governance. He also appealed to the concerned government agencies to deal decisively with those who stir hatred and divisions among Kenyans. “In relation to the elections, I call upon the President to initiate the process of appointing the commissioners of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to replace those who resigned. “The IEBC should be fully constituted for proper management of elections as the country readies itself for next year's general election.” He also urged the National Assembly to expedite the passing of bills that would ensure free, fair and credible elections. They include Political Parties’ Primaries Bill, the Referendum Bill, Campaign Finance (amendment) Bill, the Representation of Special Interest Groups Bill and Gender Parity Bill.
