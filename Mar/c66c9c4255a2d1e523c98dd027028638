Taxi services-Bolt has introduced a new ride category on its platform dubbed Bolt Green to offer eco-friendly rides as the company moves towards reducing its ecological footprint. In a statement on Wednesday, the platform said the category will have hybrid and electric cars. This is to reduce emissions during trips taken on the Bolt platform thus offering greener transport options. It will attract similar rates as the Bolt Base category, with a minimum fare of Sh 300. Passengers will be able to choose the new ride-type when they order a car in the Bolt app at no extra cost. “We continue to scale up our operations for the benefit of our customers and the communities in which we operate. Having electric and hybrid vehicles on our platform is a step towards ensuring environmentally conscious ways for people to move around in the city and reduce our ecological footprint,” Country manager Ola Akinnusi said. “The new category also aims at expanding Bolts ride options thereby creating more economic opportunities for drivers and providing passengers with more options to choose from." Bolt Green is currently available to Bolt customers in Nairobi with plans to expand to more cities soon. Akinnusi said other Bolt services will still be available to customers at the same affordable rates across the 16 urban centres where Bolt currently operates. The company offers the widest array of ride-hailing options at the most affordable prices in the market and continues to have steady growth in operations driven by the demand for its quality services. “Our core business is to provide reliable, safe and affordable transportation services to everyone and we are excited to make travel easier and smarter across the country. We are humbled to offer Kenyans more choices to move smartly in cities,” Akinnusi said.
