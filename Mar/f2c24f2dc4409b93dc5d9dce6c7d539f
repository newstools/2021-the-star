The CAS added that 830 patients are admitted to various health facilities in the country, while 2,332 are on home Based Isolation and Care. Mwangangi said that the trend is worrying and that all the efforts must be met to arrest the situation. “The rising cases are an indication that we have lowered our guard and the majority of us have drawn caution to the window. This must not be the case. Since we have warned the country that we are already in the third wave, this is the time to return to the basics,” Mwangangi said. Mwangagni has said that the country should continue following the Covid protocols to ensure that the virus is contained even as schools are closed.

The CAS said that the country will consider reintroducing stringent measures to curb the situation if the current trend does not improve. “We have seen in situations wherein other countries, complete lockdowns have started getting effected again.
