Rapper King Kaka has told Meru artistes not to depend on politicians. He said the artistes should instead tap into Meru's population of 1-7 million people and about 600,000 youths to earn from concerts. “Do Meru artistes need to come to Nairobi for their talents recognition?” the 'Wajinga Sisi' singer asked. "I challenge you to take music as any other career. Invest in it. What is stopping you from doing a concert of 200,000 youths per month and make it?" King Kaka spoke during the launch of new artiste Jaysoul. He urged Meru artistes to put aside their differences and come together for success. He committed to sponsoring Jaysoul for his next song through his empire. King Kaka urged artistes to use the power of social media to reach out to more clients.
