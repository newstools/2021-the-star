Acute water shortage has hit Kericho town and its environs for the last two weeks following the drying up of streams feeding the Timbilil water treatment plant. Speaking to the Star on Tuesday, Kericho Water and Sanitation Company managing director David Siele said the situation was beyond control after main streams from the upper Mau forest went dry because of prolonged drought. He said the main water pipeline from Timbilil in Mau Forest was just getting a quarter of water flow which was not sufficient to feed the entire town and its environs. Siele said Kewasco could not effectively carry out meaningful water rationing from a quarter amount of water from the treatment plant. He appealed to residents to bear with them as they wait for rains in late this month and early next month. “The little water we are getting is being diverted to local hospitals and government institutions in the town,” Siele said. Nyagacho, Mjini, Majengo and several town environments that rely on Timbilil water treatment plant have gone without water. Residents were being forced to use contaminated water from the nearby Ainaptidenyet River that separates Kericho town and its environs. Ironically, Kericho town and the environs had been getting abundant rainfalls since last year as opposed to the bordering Mau West Forest that feeds streams that flow to Timbilil water treatment plant.
