Football Kenya Federation referees manager Sylevester Kirwa has warned incompetent referees that they risk disciplinary action for their misconduct when  discharging their duties. Complaints have lately intensified in the Kenya Women’s Premier League in the recent weeks about dubious decisions being made against certain teams. Mumias-based Wadadia and Trans-Nzoia Falcons have recently complained about alleged dubious penalties given to Kisumu All Starlets when they faced off at Moi Stadium, Kisumu, much to the displeasure of their respective technical benches. Wadadia coach Rashid Sumba vented his frustration on the official following their 2-2 draw hence denying the team a chance to close the six-point gap with leaders Vihiga Queens. Kirwa confirmed that his committee handled such a case last week and action has been taken  against some officials. The referees’ boss observed that elements of impartiality are retrogressive to the sport at a time the country is burning  the midnight oil to better the game and bring sanity to the sport. To help curb such  a vice, Kirwa has asked the teams to channel the complaints  to his committee for stringent action. He said incompetent referees have no place in Kenyan football and those found guilty will be relieved of their duties. Kirwa is surprised that some officials have not improved even after undergoing a  three-day refresher exercise last month .
