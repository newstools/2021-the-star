The government of Kiambu has urged land rate defaulters to clear their arrears within three months or face the music. Governor James Nyoro on Saturday said the county has intensified revenue collection to meet its budget. He said more than 2,000 established traders, developers, investors and companies have yet to pay their land rates. He said the county government has a task force, which, in two months, will advise them on how to go after the defaulters to boost revenue. Nyoro warned that they will shut down businesses of those with huge income but have failed to pay until they do so. He spoke at Tilisi Development PLC, a real estate company, in Limuru during the commissioning of affordable housing units. He was the chief guest. “We are putting on notice well-established traders, investors and even companies that have defaulted on land rates. We have more than 2,000 of them who are known and can pay, but they have decided to ignore. “We have formed a task force that will advise on how to collect the defaulted land rates, advise traders on how to pay and what to do with those who default. As of now, we cannot say how much, but within two months when the task force will sit down, we shall stop all operations of those who will not have paid,” he warned. He was accompanied by Tilisi CEO Renee Nanji and board of management chairman Joseph Mukirai and Co CEO Kavit Shah. The project is meant to complement the housing pillar of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda. She said they were partnering with the national and county governments. Nyoro warned also put fake housing inspectors on notice. He said such people visit investors to check on their building plans with the intent to extort money from them. The county chief said his administration had improved the processing of building plans so investors can access them quickly and easily to avoid inconveniences.
