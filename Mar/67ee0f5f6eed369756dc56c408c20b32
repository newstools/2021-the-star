Gilad Millo has recovered from Covid-19 after testing positive for the virus. The 'Sema Milele' hitmaker had been in quarantine for 14 days and has finally been given the green light by his doctors. “This virus is aggressive, friends, and merciless," he wrote over the weekend. "The fact that I am here writing this post makes me one of the lucky ones." He urged everyone to follow the rules, keep social distance and wear masks to get through the pandemic. “Tonight is the eve of the Jewish Passover, a holiday symbolising freedom. I am thankful for my freedom and for life. A huge thank you for all the love and support you sent my way. I am humbled and grateful.” On March 12, the Israeli-Kenyan based singer announced his diagnosis to his fans. “After feeling some aches and pains and developing a slight fever today I tested positive for Covid-19," he said. "I have alerted those I have been in contact with in line with the required protocols. I will be quarantining at home until this passes, God willing, and will be back at it before you can say 'Corona'.” GIlad is among celebrities who have revealed their status after testing positive for the virus. Other public figures to do so include Mwana FA, Sallam Mendez, Jeff Koinange, Kush Tracey and Robert Burale.
