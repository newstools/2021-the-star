Less than five months ago on November 10, 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Nairobi Commuter Rail System. The project has reduced both vehicular and human traffic congestion. Kenya Railways aims to carry as many as 230,000 passengers daily. The commuter rail is part of the Master Plan of an integrated commuter system within the city and its environs. It also comprises the Bus Rapid Transit, monorail and underground rail. The Nairobi Commuter Rail Service (NCR) was introduced in May 1992 in response to a series of strikes by the matatu minibus operators. Over the years, demand has been low, which, according to the new managing director has been due to poor standards of the station facilities Commuter trains currently run on the Nairobi-Imara Daima-Syokimau route, the Nairobi-Githurai-Mwiki-Kahawa-Ruiru route, Nairobi-Embakasi route and the Nairobi-Kibera-Kikuyu route.
