Nairobi county non-essential offices will be closed for 30 days starting today. In a statement on Sunday, Deputy Governor Anne Kananu said her administration will review its work environment and daily interactions due to the rising cases of Covid-19. “The third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has been escalating and has proven severe, leading to loss of lives of county staff, family and friends. It is important to note that we consider the safety of our employees and customers as core to our operations,” she said. “The county government of Nairobi will close its non-essential offices for a period of 30 days with effect from Monday, March 29, 2021, in strict compliance with the 15th presidential address on the pandemic.” Kananu said critical and essential services at City Hall will continue uninterrupted. They include health, disaster management and coordination, revenue collection, water, environment and sanitation, finance and economic planning, procurement and supply chain, security, public communications and customer services. The deputy governor also said she will lead her cabinet in getting vaccinated against Covid-19. “The World Health Organization has approved the distribution and use of various vaccines. Let's get vaccinated and fight this invisible enemy,” she said. On Friday, President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered cessation of movement into and out of five "disease infected". They are Nairobi, Nakuru, Machakos, Kiambu and Kajiado. Curfew in the five counties will start from 8pm to 4am. For the rest of the counties, the curfew will start from 10pm to 4am. Nairobi has continued to be the epicentre of the virus since the first case was reported in the country in March last year. Kenya has witnessed a spike in new cases since January after the government relaxed restriction measures imposed to curb the pandemic late last year. A crisis is already looming in the city’s hospitals as most intensive care units, both in private and public hospitals, are almost full.
