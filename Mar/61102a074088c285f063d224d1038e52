Four Kenyatta University lecturers have moved to court seeking to stop Thursday's UASU elections. Franklin Kinoti, Chrispus Easier, Antony Wasena and Moses Opiyo have challenged the University Academic Staff Union's KU chapter elections. Through lawyer Danstan Omari, the lecturers argue that the UASU secretary has unjustifiably excluded them and 145 other lecturers from the voter register. Omari says his clients and all the other lecturers are keen on participating in the union elections. "The sudden closure of their office resulted to many members of UASU who are legitimate voters to be closed out of the register" reads court documents. They further claim that UASU KU chapter never provided an option of online submission of forms prior to the sudden closure of their office. "The UASU secretary has frustrated member registration when he closed the union doors consequently locking out persons that wished to register between then and December 31, 2020 when the registration process was scheduled" reads court papers. It is their argument that they have fully subscribed as members of the union having met all requirements set under the union's constitution. According to court papers, the lecturers expect to participate in the forthcoming elections but are apprehensive that they will not as a result of their exclusion from the voter register. "There is no justification why the impugned voter register has unlawfully discriminated them by being excluding from the register yet they are all qualified to participate in the elections. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
