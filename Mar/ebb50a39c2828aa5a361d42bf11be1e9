Speaking during the launch, Heath CS Susan Mochache said the Ministry will employ data management and reporting electronic vaccine registry dabbed ' The Chanjo Management Information system'. The digital system which was developed by experts from the ministry of ICT is said to help the ministry of health in vaccine traceability and ensuring that stocks are professionally managed. "It will track and manage vaccination schedules. It helps in the routine, reporting and addressing any adverse effects and will provide us with reports which we will use for decision making and policy keeping," Mochache said.
