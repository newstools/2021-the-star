Red-hot Kariobangi Sharks striker Eric Kapaito has started his journey to recovery from a hamstring injury he sustained earlier this week while in a residential training camp with Harambee Stars. The Namanga-born marksman, who has eleven league goals to his name this season, confirmed he will be out for a fortnight but he is yearning to get fit quickly. “I am going to be out for two weeks but I have already started my rehabilitation and I hope (fingers crossed) I will be back playing again soon,” he said. The 2019 Footballer of the Year missed out on yesterday’s African Cup of Nations Qualifier against Egypt and will certainly also not be available for the final clash against Togo. “It’s certainly disappointing but that those are the hazards of the game. I have to stay positive and stick to my recovery regime,” said the 25-year-old. Kapaito scored his first international goal in a recent friendly against Tanzania to continue his prolific start to the campaign that has now been derailed by the injury. His goals have been instrumental in putting Sharks to within striking distance of the FKF Premier League leaders Tusker. In his enforced absence, compatriot and fellow Harambee Stars forwards James Mazembe and Daniel Sakari are expected to shoulder the goal-scoring burden for William Muluya’s charges.
