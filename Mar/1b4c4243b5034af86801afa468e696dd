Football Kenya Federation (FKF) National Executive Committee member Joseph Andere is confident the football governing body will secure sponsorship for Division Two and regional leagues. “Most of our leagues have sponsors. As a federation, we are burning the midnight oil to ensure the two leagues get sponsors because the clubs are suffering financially,” he said.  Andere spoke at Ikonge Primary School grounds, where he launched the Nyanza regional league. He was accompanied by several FKF officials among them Kisii County chairman Jezreel Mbegera and his Nyamira counterpart Luthers Mokua. During the opening match, Kisii County’s Ichuni FC defeated Ekerenyo from Nyamira 4-2 . Andere said 36 teams will participate in the league and will be drawn into three zones. Zone 'A'  will feature teams from Kisii and Nyamira while Zone 'B' will comprise  teams from Kisumu and Siaya counties. Zone 'C 'will encompass  Migori and Homa Bay counties. Top three teams from each zone will play in a mini league with the winner qualifying to the Division Two league while the second placed team will face a team from Rift Valley in a play-off. Luthers Mokua, the former Wazito CEO, said the launch of the regional league is a good step for footballers and referees. “We trained over 100 referees and this is a perfect opportunity for them to officiate more matches. This will help them gain experience and money because the county leagues are also going on,” said Mokua. He warned teams against fielding players featuring in other leagues. “I understand the transfer window is still open. Teams should not field players who are registered with other clubs,” he added. On his part, Mbegera also welcomed the league and announced that teams have started registering for the women’s regional league. “Already, four teams from Kisii and two from Nyanira have registered for the league,” said Mbegera.
