Virginia Mutei won her maiden title wine after beating former Lady Captain Jane Koech and Wesley Kiprono on count back  during the Kenya Seed Golf Series at Eldoret Golf Club. The handicap 35 golfer carded 42 stableford points to beat Koech and Kiprono on countback ahead of next month’s Classic showdown in Kitale. Despite facing challenges with the new World Handicap System (WHS), Mutei said she was prepared for the challenge after thorough training last week. She, however, admitted that the start in each nine was difficult but she had to overcome the pressure and play with a relaxed mind hence the good results. “I had bad results in the opening holes in each nine and this was because of playing on the men’s course due to the new system,” she said. She especially said she had difficulties in the second nine where there was a total hold up for about an hour. “I started badly in the second nine because of the holdup thus concluding with plus 8. However,  kept on improving especially on the most difficult hole 14 that borders a river and many trees,” said Mutei. Playing handicap 27, Koech placed second with Kiprono (Handicap 25) completing the podium while Amos Butit wrapping up the prize list. Kennedy Serem won the best effort title on 21 points as Aron Kitur won the nearest to pin prize. Nandi Bears’ Faith Chemtai picked the longest drive award in the ladies cadre as former Eldoret captain Sandeep Grewal won the men’s title. Grewal was on the podium again to receive the first nine title on 21 points as former Moi Teaching and referral Hospital director John Kibosia won the second nine title with similar scores. Kitale golf club’s Elly Rutto won the staff prize on 28 points as Chemtai picked the guest prize on 38 points.
