ODM leader Raila Odinga's allies on Sunday campaigned for BBI and took a swipe at Deputy President William Ruto for deceiving Kenyans with his wheelbarrow narrative. Led by ODM Nairobi branch chairman George Aladwa, the leaders rallied Kibera residents to support the initiative saying they stand to benefit. "BBI will bring a lot of change. Those opposing BBI are enemies of the people and we must reject them, " Aladwa said. The leaders held a rally at Kamukunji grounds in Raila's Kibera political base. ODM had communicated that party leader Raila Odinga would grace the rally but he did not show up. Insiders said there was a change of plans at the last minute. Aladwa who is the current Makadara MP said as ODM MPs they have resolved to unanimously vote for the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 that was introduced in Parliament last Thursday. While rooting for BBI, Embakasi East MP Babu Owino attacked DP Ruto saying he is deceiving poor Kenyans for his 2022 interests. 'Imagine you educate your child, from nursery to primary, secondary and finally university only for them to become wheelbarrow driver," he said. Mathare MP Antony Oluoch warned they will not entertain any plans to shortchange Raila in the handshake deal, saying will storm any office where such plans are being made. Former Makadara MP Reuben Ndolo dared Ruto to face them (BBI proponents) head-on, saying BBI mashinani campaigns have kicked off.
