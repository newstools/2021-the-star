 The Busia government has put up two lightning arresters in Teso North villages where lightning strikes have killed 10 people since 2005. The two arrestors in Korisai and Kakapel villages are 30 metres high and cover a radius of three kilometres. The Sh4.6 million arresters were installed by Yard Fields. Lightning strikes have been experienced in the area since the 1970s. The worst incident happened in 2005 when seven pupils from Korisai Primary School were killed when lightning struck their institution. In December 2018, three members of a family and one university student were killed after a lightning strike in Kakapel. The family was in their house when the tragedy occurred near Kakapel junction along the Ang’urai-Malaba road. Three others were injured. Busia county disaster management chief officer Ezekiel Okwach said they have mapped other areas where arresters will be installed. “We shall increase funding to cover more areas of Teso North, Teso South, Samia and Bunyala subcounties,” Okwach said. The Korisai lightning arrester was installed at Korisai Primary School and will cover the nearby secondary school and surrounding areas. The one at Kakapel in will cover Kakapel primary, Albert Ekirapa secondary, Kakapel market and the surrounding areas that stretch to Akichelesit market. In 2017, lightning hit the Kakapel Primary school football pitch during a match, killing one player on the spot.  Edited by P.O
