Anti-corruption Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi has referred Governor Okoth Obado's corruption case back to head of the division to allocate whom to hear the case. The case was coming up on Friday for fixing of hearing dates but Mugambi noted that his diary was long and he had far dates. Mugambi said the file should be taken to Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti who will consult with the other Magistrate on who has nearer dates to hear the case. Mugambi issued another mention date on April 1 when the accused will be given hearings dates by the magistrate who will be given the file. One of the accused - Peninah Auma's lawyer - had asked the court to push the mention to April 9 because of his client. The court heard that Auma is elderly and cannot afford to organize for the trip from Migori in a week's time as had been suggested by the prosecution. Mugambi was asked to consider some of the accused who don't have money to pay for their lawyers' transport to court on short notice. Mugambi ruled that April 9 was far and he would only agree to a date not later than March 30. All parties agreed to mention the matter on April 1. In the case Obado is charged alongside his four children and other county officials in relation to the loss of Sh73 million. They are charged with conspiracy to commit an economic crime, unlawful acquisition of public property and money laundering. Last year Mugambi dismissed an application by Obado seeking to reduce their charges. He had argued that the charge sheet is bloated and some of the counts should be removed.
