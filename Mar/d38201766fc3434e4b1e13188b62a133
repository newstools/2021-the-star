National Parks, Reserves and Sanctuaries will now remain open from 6 am to 5 pm. This means that it will no longer close at 6 pm. KWS in a statement on Wednesday said it had to adjust the closing time of 5 pm with strict observance of Ministry of Health Covid-19 protocols. This is only for the disease infected counties which include; Nairobi, Kiambu, Nakuru, Machakos and Kajiado counties. This is after President Uhuru Kenyatta revised curfew time in the five counties. Uhuru said the curfew will start at 8 pm and end at 4 am. In addition, Parks Reserves and Sanctuaries that fall in the disease infected counties will close all picnic sites and other sites where visitors have a tendency to congregate. Parks, Reserves and Sanctuaries in all other counties are open but KWS said it will continue to enforce the set Covid-19 protocols. Kenya Wildlife Service stepped up measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in National Parks and Reserve in line with the President's directives.
