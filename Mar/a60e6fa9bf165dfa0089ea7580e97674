Ford Kenya party officials in Nyanza have thrown their weight behind their former chairman Mukhisa Kituyi to contest the 2022 presidential seat on the party ticket. The officials who met in Kisumu resolved to back the candidature of Kituyi who recently announced his intention to seek the presidency. Kituyi who conducted a tour of Western Kenya a couple of weeks ago had resigned as the Secretary General of UNCTAD. The party’s Nyanza branch chairman Nyabote Aburi said the party must hold an NDC meeting soon to elect new national party officials to give the party new leadership and direction politically. The group stated that they support the MP Eseli Simiyu faction and his group which has got the MP Wafula Wamunyinyi has the party leader. He noted that the party does not and has never held any election for the past 11 years. 'The last time we held party elections was in 2010, up-to now we have not held any election and therefore we are in total violation of the political parties Act, Constitution and even the national party's constitution", he said. Aburi said in 2022, the party must have a candidate in the ballot accusing other party leaders who often backed off at the eleventh hour after announcing their candidature. The branch officials noted that  Kituyi had not resigned from Ford Kenya party and  he is the candidate they will field in the presidential contest. Speaking to the press in Kisumu when he read the resolutions, Aburi said Kitiyu has a clean record from his days when he was a Member of Parliament in Kimilili. Felix Minda, Kisumu County Ford Kenya chairman said Ford Kenya needs a radical surgery.
