The Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu has removed the name of the Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura from the list of Jubilee Party members. In a letter addressed to the JP secretary general Raphael Tuju, the registrar said that she took the step pending the adoption and ratification of the same by the party's National Executive Committee. The registrar said that the decision is based on the Party Disciplinary Committee report and its decision dated February 6, 2021, the National Management Committee resolution that was reached on February 8, and The Political Parties Dispute Tribunal ruling that was made on March 26. Last month, the party summoned the senator over indiscipline and disloyal. Mwaura had been dragged to the disciplinary committee after Jubilee Party's national chair Nelson Dzuya complained he had been disloyal. Dzuya had told the committee chaired by lawyer Muchai Lumatete that Mwaura had pledged allegiance United to Democratic Alliance, a party associated with Deputy President William Ruto and the hustler movement. However, the nominated senator had said that his woes have nothing to do with pledging alliance to UDA, but everything to do with supporting Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. Mwaura described the disciplinary process as a witch hunt and accused Lumatete's team of being hell-bent on expelling him. He said the summons came soon after Dzuya and vice-chairman David Murathe asked for his removal from the party. He has no faith in the independence of the committee. Mwaura is among the six senators who had been kicked out by the party’s top organ NMC over indiscipline. Others are Millicent Omanga, Victor Prengei, Falhada Dekow Iman, Naomi Jillo Waqo and Mary Seneta Yiane
