A Meru MCA has sued a secondary school teacher for fraud over a land dispute. Abogeta West representative DMK Kiogora alleges that Evans Murimi sold him land in Murungurune but resorted to blackmail afterwards. Kiogora reported the matter to Murungurune police station where officers took up the matter and arrested Murimi. On Monday, Murimi faced three charges before Nkubu senior resident magistrate Ezra Ayuka. The charges included robbery with violence, arson and refusing to have his fingerprints taken by Murungurune police station officers. The court heard that on the night of March 8, 2021 at unknown time at Nyumba ya Mbiti village, Kiongone location in Imenti South, jointly with others not before court Murimi wilfully and unlawfully set fire to a house valued at Sh250,000. Murimi also denied robbery with violence charges. The court heard that he and others not before court armed with dangerous weapons robbed Sammy Muriithi Joel Sh2,700 and a phone valued at Sh10,700. The case brought by the MCA will begin on Tuesday before the same court. Kiogora said he bought a quarter acre of land from Murimi and started paying in in instalments. Murimi consented and transferred the land title deed to Kiogora after full payment started threatening him. "Apart from the agreed payment of Sh540,000 he has blackmailed me Sh480,000 after he cheated me the land I bought was not his but of his wifeâ€™s. I paid his wife same money I later paid him but he sued me but we settled the matter outside court where elders including his father and my father were present," Kiogora said.
