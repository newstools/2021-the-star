The Kenya Bureau of Standards has approved 10 new standards among others, outlining permissible limits for noise emitted from stationary objects in a given environment. The new standards which cover equipment such as air moving devices, specify procedures for calibration (testing) for optimal physical and performance characteristics of stationary sound sources. “The adoption of these standards will aid in reducing noise pollution from stationary sources by ensuring that noise levels do not exceed the maximum permissible acoustical limits especially in a manufacturing plant, office premises as well as our houses,” Kebs Managing Director Bernard Njiraini said. The standards body also approved Non-Destructive Standards which guide training requirements for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Personnel that ensures eligibility for qualification by third-party certification. “The adoption of NDT personnel standards will be beneficial to Kenya's ambition to be a Regional Designated Centre within East Africa in conjunction with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) project,” he added. Last month, Kebs approved 10 new standards outlining safe use, storage, transportation and disposal of Petroleum and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) products in the country. Njiraini said the new standards aim to safeguard consumers throughout the LPG and other petroleum products supply chain. The new standards provide specifications for LPG mountable burners and cylinder grills used by the 3Kg and 6Kg LPG domestic cylinders and safe disposal of cylinders found not fit for use.
