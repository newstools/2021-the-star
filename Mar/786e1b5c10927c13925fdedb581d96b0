A city businessman who allegedly sent threatening messages to the managing director of Magnate Ventures has confirmed he is ready to have his case heard. George Mungai confirmed to court on Monday that he had received all witness statements from the prosecution, so the trial can begin. Milimani senior resident magistrate Christine Njagi directed the case to be heard on June 15. Mungai denied the charges and is out on a surety bond of Sh200,000. He is accused of sending a WhatsApp message to Stanley Kinyanjui on November 10 last year, stating, “For now, brace yourself as I claim what is mine. Court battles are expensive, all I need is my land, otherwise, I will face you like a man.” The prosecution said Mungai sent the message through his mobile phone to a Safaricom line belonging to Kinyanjui. The location of the call was not immediately identified. He is also charged with sending a threatening message to Kinyanjui on November 13, 2020, saying that he was not surrendering until he gives him back his land. He also faced another charge of knowingly publishing false information that was likely to discredit Kinyanjui's reputation. The court heard that Mungai also published a photo of Kinyanjui calling him a thief and land swindler on November 15, last year. (Edited by V. Graham)
