The Media Council of Kenya has warned media houses against breaching the code of ethics while reporting on sexual violence. The council in a statement on Monday said its attention had been drawn to reports on broadcast that violate code of ethics. CEO David Omwoyo said recent news items and articles have exposed victims of sexual violence and bereaved members of the public to unwarranted psychological and emotional anguish. "The council cautions journalists, media practitioners and media enterprises against the breach of the code of conduct and warns that action will be taken upon those who contravene the law," Omwoyo said. The CEO said the code of conduct provides for accuracy, fairness and privacy as it outlaws intrusion into grief and shock and victims of sexual offences respectively. "Tragedy and suffering may not be part of news and therefore, persons subject to the Act must exercise sympathy, discretion and sensitivity when publishing content on victims of sexual violence and the bereaved," he said. Omwoyo said although deaths are a matter of public record as the information is in the public domain, the media must proceed with caution and act ethically when reporting such stories.
