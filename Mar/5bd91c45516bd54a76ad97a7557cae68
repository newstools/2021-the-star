The immediate former personal assistant to Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has been evicted from a county house. Stan Wepundi's family was kicked out by county askaris from the Milimani home and all their belongings thrown out. Wepundi was Wangamati’s aide until last month when he was sacked and made a research assistant after falling out with his boss. The two disagreed soon after the burial of Kabuchai MP Lusweti Mukwe when Wangamati received a hostile reception. He was heckled by mourners and had to cut short his speech. Wangamati is said to have blamed his tribulation on Wepundi and two other officers—Simiyu Mutaki of the logistics department and Antony Wamalwa. It is alleged that he lashed out at the trio for not using they were given to mobilise his supporters so he could arrive to a rousing welcome. Wepundi was immediately replaced with Brian Kibulo. On Tuesday, efforts to get the governor's or Housing executive Bramwel Murgor's comment were unsuccessful. They did not return calls. Neither did they respond to text messages. County enforcement officers arrived at the Milimani home, forced their way in and started removing Wepundi family's belongings, saying they were acting on orders from "above". Wepundi was not at home but his family members were. His wife's pleas to have them wait for her husband to return fell on deaf ears. Her frantic attempts to reach Wepundi on the phone were also unsuccessful. Their fate was sealed. Journalists covering the eviction party were not spared. They were roughed up by the county enforcement officers. Wepundi later termed the exercise inhumane. “I'm really surprised by the move and it comes as an eye opener. Many things are happening in these offices and only time will absolve me,” he said, without elaborating. On social media, opinion was divided. Some netizens condemned the governor for being inhuman, while others told Wepundi to accept and move on.
