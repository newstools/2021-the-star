Kenya remains unbowed despite the crisis the coronavirus pandemic has brought in the last year. These are the words of President Uhuru Kenyatta during his national address on Friday. "As much as our nation was wounded, it remains unbowed," he said. "Instead of giving in to the shock of lockdowns, businesses have reengineered their business models, responding to shocks." Uhuru said the country's approach has been a mixed bag of fortunes. He cited the cessation of movement which had heavy costs on the economy, but saved lives. "We chose life over economy," he said. "You can always revive an economy, but you can't revive a lost life." All public gatherings have been prohibited for 30 days from midnight on Friday. Uhuru said this will be extended if infections don't go down. "This should be followed regardless of the political or social standing," he said. Uhuru also extended the 10pm-4am curfew for 60 days. Bars and restaurants were directed to close by 9pm. Burials should be conducted within 72 hours of death and gatherings will be limited to family members, capped at 100 persons. The number also applies for weddings. "This is being done for your good; we don't want to go from a wedding to a funeral...." Uhuru said. "I ask you in all humility, let's care about others' lives."
