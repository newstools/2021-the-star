Milimani Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi on Wednesday expressed his sadness after the death of a state witness who was to be cross-examined in a Sh122.3 million fraud case. Jennifer Wambua had given testimony in a case where Lugari MP Ayub Savula and former Principal Secretary Sammy Itemere have been charged alongside 28 others with conspiring to defraud the government of Sh122.3 million. Andayi said it was unfortunate that NLC official Jennifer Wambua died under mysterious circumstances. He adjourned the case which was being mentioned virtually to fix a hearing date and directed that the matter be mentioned before him in an open court on Thursday morning. This is after the DPP through prosecution counsel told the court that the investigating officer had informed him in the morning about the incident. "Your honour there is a new development in the case on the passing of our witness Jennifer Wambua who was stood down for cross-examination. The investigating officer has said investigations into her murder has commenced to find out what is the cause of death," the prosecution said. The magistrate however said he was shocked as it was very unfortunate that it was his first time having such kind of information in his many years of practice. "In my many years of practice, I have not had such incident and it is important that the matter be mentioned in a physical court," Andayi said. The case will be mentioned on Thursday. Wambua, a deputy director of communications at the National Land Commission was found murdered and her body dumped in a thicket in Ngong last Saturday.
