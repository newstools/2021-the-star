A suspected gangster was on Monday evening shot dead by DCI detectives  in Nairobi. The suspect identified as Abbas was alleged to be part of an organized criminal gang that has terrorized residents living within Nairobi’s East lands suburbs. The DCI said in a statement via Twitter that detectives were alarmed when the suspect was seen on the passenger seat of different motorcycles cruising along Kangundo road. "Detectives gave chase and flagged down the motorcycle but instead of pulling over the pillion passenger drew a firearm and started shooting at our officers indiscriminately," the DCI said. However, the DCI sleuths responded swiftly, shooting back at the suspect killing him on the spot. The rider, caught on the crossfire managed to escape by the skin of his teeth leaving the motorcycle behind. According to the Directorate, detectives are in hot pursuit of the rider. One Glock pistol suspected to have been stolen from a Police Officer, three live rounds of 9mm caliber, and 11 other live ammunitions of different caliber were recovered from the scene. It is believed the suspect might have been in possession of another firearm. "Abbas was a dangerous criminal connected to a spate of murders within Buru Buru, Kayole and Dandora, including the shooting of woman in Kariobangi who was lucky to survive, a few months ago," the DCI said.
