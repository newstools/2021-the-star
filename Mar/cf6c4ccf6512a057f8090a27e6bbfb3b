A ring of Kenyan footballers suspected of engaging in match fixing scams could soon be exposed. This is after Football Kenya Federation launched their Integrity action plan on Saturday aimed at arresting and discouraging the vice in their leagues. Mike Kamure will, subsequently, head an integrity department established by the federation in line with Fifa and Caf regulations. In a workshop that brought together FKF Premier League club chairmen, Kamure took the delegates through the plan that entails the federation’s strategy on raising awareness on match manipulation, as well as its detection and response strategy. While addressing a gathering comprising representatives from 18  Premier League clubs, FKF CEO Barry Otieno raised a red flag over the vice, pointing out it was briskly spreading its roots across the world. “Match manipulation is a global concern. FKF with the assistance of Caf and Fifa has proactively set up this workshop to inform and educate clubs through their officials on the importance of detecting and preventing the vice in order to protect the integrity of the game,” said FKF CEO, Barry Otieno. An online reporting mechanism, which allows people to confidentially raise the flag on suspicious activity, has also been set up and can now be accessed. The integrity plan workshop will be part of the continuous process that will target all the stakeholders including, club officials, players, media, and match officials across all the FKF leagues. In February, a Ugandan national was arrested in Kisumu after he allegedly tried to fix a Premier League match between Western Stima and KCB, that had been scheduled for Moi Stadium, Kisumu. The suspect was cornered at a Kisumu Hotel by the police who were accompanied by Western Stima chairman Laban Jobita.
