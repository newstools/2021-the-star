The Kenya Pipeline Company has joined thousands of Kenyans in mourning the death of former NTV News anchor, Winnie Mukami, who died as a result of Covid-19 complications on Thursday. In a statement issued on Thursday, KPC chairperson Rita Okuthe said, "We pray to Almighty God to give the family strength, courage, and forbearance necessary to see them through this very trying period. On behalf of KPC Board of Directors, Management, and staff and on my own behalf, I wish to convey to the family our sincere and heartfelt condolences." Mukami was a renowned broadcasting legend and a Public Relations consultant who contributed immensely to the media industry for which she will be remembered for many years to come, the company described her. "She was appointed to the Board of Kenya Pipeline Company on 6th June 2018 and was later appointed Chair of the Board Human Resources Committee, a role she served with dedication until August 7, 2020. "During her tenure, she  introduced far reaching policies that improved the well-being of employees in the Parastatal. Mukami was humble, charming and a beautiful soul. She will be greatly missed," Okuthe added. In 2010, Mukami left NTV after seven years at the media house. “I enjoyed my time in the media and when my time was up, I embraced it and started thinking of a way forward. Now I am an established businesswoman who also thinks of how to give back to the community, even though getting here has not been an easy task,” she said then. Mukami became known in 2003 when she anchored NTV News during its launch.
