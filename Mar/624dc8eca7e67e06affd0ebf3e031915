A court has rejected a plea by Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa to keep his firearm after the government ordered he be disarmed. The MP who had been told the surrender his firearm last week, sued the state  saying his security is at stake and wants the court to intervene. However, Milimani Court judge Justice Mrima made a conservatory order on Monday staying the decision of the Firearm Licensing Board directing the MP to surrender both his license and firearm. In his plea, Didmus claimed he was not given any reason for the surrender and was apprehensive if the state is not stopped, his firearm would be taken from him exposing his family to grave danger. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i on Friday said politicians found misusing their guns during election campaigns will have their firearm licences revoked. Matiang'i said the violence witnessed during Thursday's by-elections in Kabuchai, Matungu and Nakuru is unacceptable. The CS said the police officers are frustrated because it’s the leaders who should be setting a good example that are breaking rules.
