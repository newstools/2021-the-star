The German Government Thursday donated forensic laboratory equipment valued at Sh26 million to DCI to enhance investigations. German deputy ambassador Thomas Wimmer donated the equipment which includes cameras and simulation crime scene tools at the DCI headquarters. Wimmer said the move is bad news to criminals and good news to victims as the equipment will help in solving crimes. ICT CS Joe Mucheru said the donation is part larger help from the German government which has among others seen major training institutions fitted with simulation rooms to help police with their training to manage crime scenes. DCI boss George Kinoti said the donation will help them solve many pending cases. He said crimes will soon be solved fast as the forensic laboratory which has been under construction for decades is almost complete. Kinoti said the construction is 98 per cent complete and its inauguration will be in weeks. This means the laboratory will be put into use to solve many unsolved cases including murder, robbery with violence, rape and housebreaking among others. Many crimes go unsolved because police lack a laboratory to help them address the cases. The service relies on foreign laboratories to conduct tests for evidence on issues under probe. For instance, toxicological tests are done either in South Africa or in Europe. The laboratory is based at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters. According to a strategic plan launched recently, the DCI plans to spend Sh7.6 billion in mobilizing operations of the forensic laboratory. The money is part of the Sh38.5 billion the inspectorate earmarks for revamping its operations in the next three years.
