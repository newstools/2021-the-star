Kenya Open winner Justin Harding was back in the groove at the par 71 Karen County Club course as Savannah Classic entered the penultimate day. The South African regained the lead after carding a 67 to lead the pack with a -17. His one stroke lead puts him in a great position to seal back-to-back titles in Nairobi. He takes over the lead from compatriot Van Tonder who dropped to joint second on a total of -14. It was a bad day in the office for Kenyan David Wakhu who dipped from T14 on Day 2 to T61 after carding a 74. This cuts Wakhu’s -8 to -5 on penultimate round. “Day three wasn’t that good. I picked a double bogey which distracted my score. All is not lost. I want to make up for it in the last round tomorrow (today) by hitting the fairways more,” Wakhu said. Van Tonder of South Africa is now on -16 and lying second. After yesterday’s round, Harding said he is happy with his play and the course, which he said suits him well. “I enjoy it out there. I drove it really well today, I put it in play and to be fair, I probably just didn’t hit it close enough to the hole. “I made a couple of good long putts but missed a couple of short ones which was a bit annoying. I think I’ve got  to just handle my emotions correctly. "Today I was a little grumpier than I’ve been for the last five days but ultimately it’s a beautiful golf course to play and as I’ve said many times, there are a bunch of birdies out there. "If you execute your plan, any one of us can go out there and score so I’m trying to fend off the rest of the guys and see what happens,” Harding said.
