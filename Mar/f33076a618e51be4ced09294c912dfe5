World Half Marathon record holder Peres Jepchirchir expects her teammates in the marathon team to pose the biggest threat to her quest for an Olympics gold. Jepchirchir was last week added to a star-studded team including world marathon champion Ruth Chepng'etich, world marathon record holder Brigid Kosgei and former London marathon champion Vivian Cheruiyot. "This will be my first time at the Olympics and will be  special for me. I know the battle for gold will be stiff but I will try my best in what is one of the strongest teams assembled by AK. My teammates are a serious threat,” Jepchirchir said. The two-time world half marathon champion has been working hard in training at her Kapsabet home. "My training for the marathon will be largely confined to Kapsabet rather than joining others in the camp. I have acclimatised to this area and feel my training will be disrupted if I move away from here," she said. The mother of one reclaimed the World Half Marathon title in Gdynia, Poland in October last year, timing 1:05:16. Jepchirchir closed the year with a course record of 2:17.5 at the Valencia Marathon in December. In the run-up to the quadrennial event, Jepchirchir was, however, reluctant to disclose any plans to participate in any international events as part of her preparations. "I cannot tell as per now because of the current Covid-19 situation. Things keep on changing but we will see what happens with time," Jepchirchir, who was due to compete at the aborted RAK Half Marathon in February, said. Following a stellar 2020, she replaced Frankfurt Marathon champion Valary Ayabei and Sally Chepyego who were dropped from the marathon team  announced last year. In the men’s marathon team, Olympics marathon champion and world marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge will be leading London Marathon runner-up Vincent Kipchumba, world marathon bronze medalist Amos Kipruto and Boston Marathon winner Lawrence Cherono.
