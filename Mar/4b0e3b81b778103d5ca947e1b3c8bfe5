Senator Irungu Kangata has explained why he ran to Deputy President William Ruto's function on Sunday in Murang'a county. In a video that went viral on Monday, Kang'ata, who donned a blue suit and matching shirt was spotted running towards a church service in which Ruto was in attendance. Kang’ata who was recently kicked out as the Jubilee Party’s Chief Whip in the Senate was spotted sprinting that even left his security detail struggling to catch up with him. But on Monday, Kang'ata explained his actions. "... I came to DP's function very late. Found the entrance blocked by vehicles. I alighted and ran past the blocking vehicles towards the church as the speeches were almost done," he said. Questionable loyalty and suspicion that Kang'ata was a mole for the Tangatanga faction of Jubilee cost him his powerful senate post. The Murang'a senator's 10-month tenure ended in acrimony at a Parliamentary Group meeting chaired by Jubilee secretary-general Raphael Tuju in Nairobi last month where allies of Ruto walked out en mass from the meeting that sealed his  fate. Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi took over his role. Kang'ata had been under intense criticism from Uhuru's loyalists after he penned a letter to the head of state discrediting the Building Bridges Initiative's popularity in Mt Kenya. Tuju said that while the Murang’a senator was within his rights to express his opinion to the President, the party took issue with how he used that privilege.
