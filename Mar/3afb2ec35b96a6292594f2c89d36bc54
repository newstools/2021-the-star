A case in which former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is facing corruption charges involving a Sh14.1 million tender will proceed to full hearing after he was found fit to stand trial. Magistrate Peter Ooko cited a mental assessment report from the Kenyatta National Hospital, which indicated that with appropriate management, mental health condition does not preclude anyone from any activity of daily life. “According to the severity of the report conducted by the medical board of KNH, it was established that Sonko is under treatment for bipolar mood disorder. An in-depth examination of his mental status has disclosed that in terms of his speech memory cognition were all found to be normal,” reads part of the report “In light of the findings, and with appropriate management, mental health conditions do not preclude anyone from any activity of daily life”. Ooko after reading the report that was presented in court sealed said, “I do believe such daily activities entail attending court, which Sonko, I believe, would have no difficulty attending”. The magistrate confirmed the earlier dates given last year, meaning the trial is to proceed from March 29 to 1 April. Earlier, Sonko through lawyer John Nyamu and Assa Nyakundi said he was under instructions from his doctor to be on bed rest until March 26. The court also heard that he is on medication. In the case, it is alleged that the former governor in December 2018 received an indirect private interest of Sh8.4 million from Fred Odhiambo in a contract connected with the county over hiring of heavy equipment. ROG Security and its director Jamal was accused of unlawfully receiving Sh14 million through Equity Bank from Fred Odhiambo. The money was in respect of a contractor hiring heavy equipment. ROG is accused of having received it whilst knowing it formed proceeds of crime. Edited by Henry Makori
