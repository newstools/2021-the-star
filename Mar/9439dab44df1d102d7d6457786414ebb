A bodyguard attached to Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and a county enforcement officer are in police custody over the loss and recovery of a firearm during a scuffle between them on Saturday night. The police constable reported to Harambee police station that he had lost his Ceska pistol loaded with 14 bullets during a confrontation at Finito bar. He named one of the county enforcement officers as the suspect. The suspect was taken into custody and upon interrogation, he led police to his home where the gun was recovered wrapped in a polythene bag and buried in a banana plantation on Sunday afternoon. Kakamega county police commander Hassan Barua on Monday said the suspects will be arraigned on Tuesday. “I am not sure the officer lost the firearm. What happened is that there was a confrontation between him and his workmate at the county and a scuffle ensued. In the process he dropped the gun and the enforcement officer picked and instead of surrendering it to police he hid it,” he said. The bodyguard was at the club and was joined by the county enforcement officer. They started talking, differed and a scuffle ensued. Police are also holding a Yamaha motorbike that belongs to the county government that was used by the enforcement officer. The enforcement officer could be charged with being in illegal possession of government stores. Police are still investigating to establish the motive behind the decision by the enforcement officer to hide the gun instead of handing it over to police. Information also remained scanty on what could have led to the confrontation between the two officers. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
