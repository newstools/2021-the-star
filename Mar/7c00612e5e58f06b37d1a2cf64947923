Newly installed Church of God East Africa Archbishop James Obunde has been told to stand firm and be courageous as he will encounter challenges in his new role. “If you get yourself into a comfort zone, just know that you are a compromised servant of God,” NCCK chairman Timothy Ndambuki advised. Ndambuki congratulated the church for the peaceful transition process after the death of Archbishop Byrum Makokha in July last year. ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi urged the clergy not to involve the political class in the leadership transition process. Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo urged Obunde to unite the church and let it grow to a new level. “We want to see this church on the next level,” the governor said. The church so far has established 67 secondary schools, 164 primary schools, 10 technical/vocational schools, two hospitals; and 4 health centtes. Due to rapid growth and expansion of the church, there is a need for project-based income generation to sustain growth and expansion. “The church through its executive council resolved to engage in meaningful income-generating projects on the church’s prime land parcels in the country,” Obunde said. He promised to respond responsibly to the growth and expansion. Others who congratulated Obunde were Luanda MP Christopher Omulele and ANC nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi.
