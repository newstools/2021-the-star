Senate speaker Kenneth Lusaka has directed that the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment), 2020 Bill be introduced in the House for first reading on Thursday. The speaker said the Senate Business Committee resolved in a meeting held on Wednesday to introduce the Bill in the House. "I direct that the clerk of the House ensure there are sufficient copies of the Bill in the form that was presented to the county assemblies by the IEBC," Lusaka said. The speaker further ordered the House's Justice and Legal Affairs committee to hold a joint meeting with their National Assembly counterpart and conduct public participation. He ordered the clerk to place an advert inviting the public to submit memoranda on the Bill. National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi delivered similar directive on Tuesday. This means the Bill will be introduced in the two Houses concurrently. Lusaka said his directives stem from the approval of the Bill by the majority of the county assemblies. He divulged that he has received notification of approval from 42 County Assemblies. This has surpassed the threshold of 24 assemblies required to advance the Bill to Parliament enroute to a referendum. On Tuesday, Muturi said the House Business Committee set the Thursday date as the bill does not require the 14 day period applicable to other bills. He said the decision on the BBI bill follows the provision of Article 257 of the Constitution which provides for expeditious introduction of legislation driven under a popular initiative. The speaker said the 14-day period applies to a bill that is being introduced in a House for the first time. “It does not apply to a bill that has originated from another House,” he said.
