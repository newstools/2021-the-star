Harambee Stars head coach Jacob 'Ghost' Mulee has been forced to go back to the drawing board ahead of their final Afcon qualifier clash after midfielder Kenneth Muguna sustained a knee injury during Kenya's last campaign against Egypt. The Gor Mahia stalwart was a joy to watch as he put up a man-of-the-match performance in their exhilarating 1-1 draw against the fancied Pharaohs of Egypt at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on Thursday. While addressing the media on Friday after the team's recovery training session at Moi Stadium, Kasarani, Mulee confirmed he will tinker the squad facing Togo on Monday to plug the gaps left by Muguna and centre back Johnstone Omurwa who received a one-match ban after picking up a straight red card on Thursday. Already, Mulee has summoned AFC Leopards defender Clyde Sineji to the squad to replace Omurwa. “We will effect a few changes to the traveling squad given Muguna is injured and Johnstone Omurwa is out on suspension. We are keen on winning this match and that informs the changes,” Mulee said. Muguna confirmed the development and ruled out any chances he would be part of the traveling party that leaves for Lome, Togo on a chartered flight. "I sustained a knee injury in our match against Egypt. I will be going for an MRI scan and hopefully, embark on a recovery program. It must have been serious because as the game progressed, I felt increasingly uncomfortable. "The doctor accorded me some first aid immediately after the match but the pain got worse by the day. I most certainly won't be traveling to Togo," said Muguna. Muguna’s absence further deepens selection concerns for Mulee especially in the midfield, given Teddy Akumu has asked for leave to attend to family issues.
