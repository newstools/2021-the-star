Was South Imenti MP Murungi Kathuri feigning ignorance on Thursday when he attempted to ride on a question by his neighbour from Tharaka Nithi? It concerned a matter touching on extending the standard gauge railway to the region. The lawmaker stood on a point of order for Tharaka Nithi MP Beatrice Nkatha to include Meru in her question to the Transport ministry. The honourable member was, however, reminded by the presiding speaker that he had powers to ask his own question. He was putting the woman representative in an awkward position. Nkatha herself was clear with him on her interest. *** A woman MP who almost went berserk and caused much drama over a local artist who portrayed women in bad light in his recent album has  been put on the spot by constituents. They question whether her outburst over protecting women was genuine or meant to take political advantage of the situation. The residents are now questioning why the MP’s deafening silence in the recent case where a woman was filmed being dragged on the road by local authorities. The woman from one of the Nyanza counties has fashioned herself as a defender of women in the country, a tag now being doubted by her constituents. *** Signs the delimitation of the proposed BBI constituencies will generate fireworks are already on display. A tussle for a constituency in Nyanza over the planned division is threatening to divide the local leadership. Already a second-term governor is embroiled in a bitter supremacy battle with an area MP over the rationale of dividing the constituency. The  governor wants one of the wards in the old constituency included in the proposed new unit. But the MP is against the move as it would disfranchise his voters. The locals have now petitioned the regional political supremo to intervene and ensure fairness in the looming delineation of the electoral unit.
