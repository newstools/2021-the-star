A Nairobi governor aspirant has been allowed to join the petition challenging Deputy Governor Anne Kananu's appointment as an interested party. Isaac Chege who is the Roots Party of Kenya (RPK) nominee was enjoined in the matter by a three-judge bench hearing the cases. There are more than nine cases all relating to the nomination and swearing in of Kananu into office which have been consolidated into one petition. In his application, Chege had argued that his rights as a voter and nominated candidate have been violated. Through lawyer Ashford Mugwuku, Chege told the court that the suspension of the Nairobi By-elections has adversely affected and frustrated him as a candidate who was ready to go out and campaign. "The applicant will be directly affected by any orders or judgement this court may issue during hearing and determination of this case" his application reads. He further argued that his intended submissions in the petition are of relevance and useful to the court as they will help court to effectively adjudicate upon the dispute.
