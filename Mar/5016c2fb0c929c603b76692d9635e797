Kabras RFC will appeal the nine-week suspension of winger Derrick Ashiundu. Ashiundu saw red in their Kenya Cup clash against Quins last week after tackling his opposite number Boniface Ochieng in the air in the fourth minute with the referee, Victor Oduor, giving him a straight red card. Kabras were forced to play 76 minutes with 14 men but still came out victorious, winning 43-5 at the RFUEA ground. Kabras RFC chairman Phillip Jalango termed the suspension 'harsh' and expressed confidence that, on appeal, his star winger will get leniency. "Ashiundu has never been a dirty player in his career. It was an unfortunate incident and I believe the judicial committee ruling was too harsh on him,” said Jalango. Jalango said similar offences in rugby playing nations attract just a two-week suspension. "Our team has done extensive research on the offence, looking at other cases in rugby nations. It (suspension) should be for a fortnight because there was no harm or malice in the offence,” added Jalango Jalango said the judicial process was rushed from the word go in contravention of regulations that offer a 72-hour timeframe to prepare a defence while they were given just 24 hours. Jalango said despite the season being suspended following last Friday's directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta, he wants a speedy resolution to the matter. "I'm hoping we can have a quick resolution so that, if or when we resume rugby activities, our player can serve his time and come back as quickly as possible," added Jalango.
