A  KCPE candidate at Tagitech Primary School in Nessuit, Njoro, will write his test from police cells after he was arrested over alleged defilement. The 17-year-old boy has been detained at the Njoro police station for more than a week after his family failed to raise bond. The boy was on Thursday charged with defiling a girl aged 11 on March 13 at Sigotik village of Nessuit, Njoro, Nakuru county, at around 7pm. He denied committing the offence and was released on Sh400,000 bond or an alternative Sh300,000 cash bail. But he was taken back to the station because his family could not raise the money. Family spokesperson Kipkurui Kaptelwa said pleas to resident magistrate Eunice Kelly to release him on free bond to allow him prepare for the national examination were fruitless. KCPE is set to commence on Monday, with the rehearsal having been done on Friday, March 19. The boy’s lawyer, Karen Wanderi, protested that the suspect was in custody for more than four days before being presented to court contrary to the Constitution. “The law states that a suspected person should be brought to court as soon as reasonably possible but not later the 24 hours after being arrested,” she said. Kaptelwa said that the family had written to Njoro subcounty police commander Jonathan Kisaka and area director of education John Wangatho to prepare the candidate as they find ways of having him out. “The family is worried that he may not have time to prepare for the exams or be in the right mental form to write the test,” he said. Kelly set the matter for mention on March 31. Edited by Henry Makori
