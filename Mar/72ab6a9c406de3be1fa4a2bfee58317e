The date for the Dock Workers Union elections has been pushed by one week to May 20 because of Idd-ul-Fitr celebrations. The union’s national executive council had initially settled for May 13 as the election date, but it might coincide with the Idd-ul-Fitr celebrations. Ramadhan is expected to start around April 13. “When Muslims complained about the date, we decided to push it by a week. However, we need to meet as the NEC to ratify that decision,” union general secretary Simon Sang said. The NEC is expected to meet this week. Sang told the Star the Sh4.3 million proposed budget for the election has been approved. The budget will cater for allowances for the appointed elections board members, refreshments during meetings and board visits to election venues. It will also cater for the hiring of ballot boxes and voting booths, printing and transportation of ballot papers, transportation of election officials and their allowances, among others. Mombasa county labour officer Willy Kimani, in a letter dated March 10, proposed 10 names to be on the DWU elections board, as requested by the union. They include Kimani himself as the board chair, D Njagi as the secretary, J Katana, C Opalakadi, G Matahi, B Bakari, T Gona, B Kase and F Kahindi as the board members. The union's elections will be conducted in Mombasa, Lamu, Kisumu, ICD Embakasi and Naivasha. According to the proposed budget seen by the Star, the elections board members will pocket Sh840,000. This is broken down to four meetings every week for four weeks. The chair will pocket Sh10,000 per sitting, secretary Sh7,500 per sitting and the members Sh5,000 each per sitting. Refreshments per sitting will cost Sh3,000 each, meaning the 16 sittings will cost Sh48,000. The board is expected to visit the elections venues three times, with each visit attracting a Sh10,000 allowance for a total of Sh30,000. Hiring of ballot boxes and voting booths will cost Sh136,500, according to the proposed budget, while printing of the 72,000 ballot papers will cost Sh468,000. Transportation of the ballot papers will cost Sh10,000 for each of the five stations where voting will take place, bringing the total to Sh50,000. Transportation of ballot boxes and booths to and from the venues will cost Sh20,000 while stamping of ballot papers will cost Sh30,000. Transportation of election officials will cost Sh180,000.
