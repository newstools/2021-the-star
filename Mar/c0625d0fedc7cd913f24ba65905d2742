Deputy President William Ruto is free to form a coalition with ODM leader Raila Odinga in preparation for the 2022 election, Ndhiwa MP Martin Owino has said. Owino on Friday said alliances are formed by individuals with common agenda, and noted that there are no permanent enemies in politics. He said DP Ruto developed his political career with the help of Raila and the ODM party, noting that nothing is wrong even if the two work together next year. The MP was responding to a statement in which Ruto was quoted saying he has no personal problem with Raila and that he can work with him. According to the DP, some politicians are trying to push him out of contesting for presidency by forming what he termed as a tribal coalition, apparently refereeing to One Kenya Alliance. The One Kenya Alliance is spearheaded by Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Gideon Moi (Kanu), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya). In response, MP Owino said Raila and Ruto have worked together in the past and nothing can stop them from teaming up again in 2022. “Politics is about interests and not personal enmity. DP Ruto is free to team up with Raila and next form government,” Owino said. According to the MP, the allusions like jamaa wa vitendawili (a man of riddles) as DP Ruto has been describing Raila are just for politics. The MP spoke on Friday when he handed over bursary cheques worth Sh734,650 to 28 students at the Kenya Medical Training College in Ndhiwa town. The MP also urged residents to support the handshake as it brought peace in the country.
