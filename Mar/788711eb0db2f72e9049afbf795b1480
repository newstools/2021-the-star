The measures put in place by President Uhuru Kenyatta to curb the spread of Covid-19 are harsh, Kiambu residents have said. Businessman Maurice Kyalo said he is concerned about the restriction of movement from the zoned areas. The zoned area has five counties - Nairobi, Machakos, Kiambu, Kajiado and Nakuru. The five counties, which the President declared "disease infected area" during his address last Friday, were put under the cessation of movement indefinitely. “I was quite devastated after hearing the measures put in place by the head of state following increased positivity rate,” he said. He said he was supposed to attend a burial of a family member in Kitui on March 31 but now he cannot go. "I understand that these measures are meant to protect people from contacting the virus but it is impossible to ignore the fact that these measures are quite tough to deal with,” he said. However resident Catherine Kibe, who works as a waitress at a hotel, supported the President's move. "Though these measures seem tough, chances of contracting the disease from customers will be minimal," she said. Joan Chege, who owns a salon, said she had made plans to travel upcountry for Easter holidays but those plans have been ruined. "I had made plans to travel upcountry for Easter holidays but now  measures have been put in place to ensure that people within zoned areas do not travel to the other 42 counties and vice versa yet my rural home is in Laikipia."
