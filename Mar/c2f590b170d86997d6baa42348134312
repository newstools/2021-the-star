Socialite Amber Ray has once again gotten engaged, this time to Nairobi businessman Jamal ‘Rohosafi’ Marlow, the Matatu Operators Association chairman. Jamal proposed to the popular socialite at a private family function and later confirmed the news on Instagram by sharing photos of their engagement. He captioned it, 'It’s official', to which Amber Ray reacted with three love emojis and a caption, 'My husband'. Marlow and Amber had been dating for over a year before they went public with their relationship in December last year. It is not the first time Amber is getting engaged as five years ago, she got hitched to another wealthy city tycoon, Zaheer Jhanda, and later got married to him as his second wife. She converted to Islam to marry Jhanda but reverted when the marriage failed after two years.
