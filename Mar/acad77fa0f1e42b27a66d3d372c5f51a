The Ministry of Health has addressed concerns over some health facilities keeping vaccines for their staff instead of acting as vaccination centres. This follows allegations of the centres turning away elligible recipients so that only the staff can benefit. "We need to correct this misunderstanding. We gave vaccines to hospitals and some of them have been assuming that the vaccines are for their staff .That is not the case,"Dr. Willies Akwale said on Wednesday. Akwale insisted that any facility that receives the vaccines has been appointed to be a vaccination post for all target groups within the phase. "As long as you are within the phase that has been called upon, you can access the services from any vaccination post," he said. He also assured Kenyans that the country has enough capacity to handle the vaccine for now, reassuring concerns of storage. "The capacity of the cold chain in Kenya to handle Covid-19 vaccine is adequate at the moment. We have adequate capacity for the 24 million doses this year," he said. This comes as 1,297 new cases were reported from a sample size of 7,450. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe urged countiesÂ to expand their ICU facilities as the numbers continue to rise. "We are urging our hospitals to quickly expand their ICU facilities. We have asked the county task force to identify areas we can convert to isolation facilities," he said on Wednesday. He also pointed out that counties will likely have to take care of their patients because Nairobi county is already dealing with a large number.
