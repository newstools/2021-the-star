Detectives have gunned down a man believed to be part of a notorious gang that has been terrorising Nairobi residents. DCI detectives bumped into three men while on patrol in KCC area within Kariobangi South Post. DCI boss George Kinoti said the detectives challenged the men to identify themselves. "One pretended to be fishing out his ID from his pocket. Instead, he drew out his gun and opened fire," Kinoti said. "Luckily, none of the bullets caught any of the officers. Officers who had taken strategic positions returned fire, fatally injuring a suspect." The other two men escaped in the darkness. A Glock pistol and three live bullets were recovered from the dead gangster. Kinoti said the man who was killed operates under a cover-up name, ‘Kibe’. The hunt for the two accomplices who fled has been intensified. The seized firearm and bullets forwarded to ballistic experts at the DCI headquarters for analysis, while the body lies at a city morgue awaiting identification.
