Kiambu has started improving hospitals in the county to ensure residents receive better medical attention, Governor James Nyoro has said. Residents of Lari and Limuru have been suffering after Tigoni Hospital was last year converted into a Covid-19 centre. They have been travelling long distances to seek health services. The governor said his administration was investing in health and a new block at Lari Level 4 Hospital will be completed by December. Construction of Bibirioni Level 4 Hospital is also going on. Nyoro spoke on Saturday. He was accompanied by CECs David Kuria (Water), Joseph Kamau (Agriculture) and Joseph Murega (Health). The others were MCAs Dominic Kiranga (Kinale), Nyutu Wamwere (Kijabe) and Joseph Karichu (Lari Kirenga). Residents said other than Tigoni Hospital, no public hospital in the county offers X-ray, surgery, dental and orthopaedics services. They said they either travel long distances to seek services from government hospitals or go to private facilities which are expensive. “In those private hospitals, we use NHIF cards or other insurance, but those who do not have such covers rely on public hospitals since they are cheap,” resident Ann Wanjiku said on Saturday. The governor urged residents to adhere to the measures put in place by the government to cut the spread of the virus. Nyoro said a lot of people have been ignoring the Covid-19 protocols, saying they had reverted to handshakes, hugging, meeting in large numbers and attending public gatherings.
