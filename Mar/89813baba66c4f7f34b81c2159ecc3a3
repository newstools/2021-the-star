A Senate Parliamentary Group meeting held on Wednesday has endorsed the ejection of Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala as Senate Deputy Minority Leader. The Nasa senators axed Malala for alleged misconduct and disrespect. The Star has established that 18 members signed the petition to remove the vocal senator from the lucrative position. Kilifi Senator Steward Madzayo (ODM) has replaced the ANC lawmaker. "Mombasa is our stronghold. Kilifi gave us a 100 per cent vote. All MPs, MCAs, woman reps, governors and senators were elected on ODM ticket," deputy minority whip Beatrice Kwamboka said. A message sent out to the members on Tuesday by minority whip Mutula Kilonzo Jr said the meeting has been summoned by Minority Leader James Orengo. Malala is being accused of alleged misconduct and mischief in the recently concluded Matungu by-election. He also accused of allegedly disrespecting some Nasa principles and frequent absence in the house.
