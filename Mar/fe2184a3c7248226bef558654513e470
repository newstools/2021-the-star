Keroche Breweries heiress Anerlisa Muigai says her mother is not sick after photos of a skinny-looking Tabitha Karanja went round, with many assuming she is either sick or depressed. Taking to her Insta stories, Anerlisa said her mother made an intentional decision to lose weight. She added that they decided to lose weight as a family, her brother included. Anerlisa also shared before and after photos to prove her point. "Leave my mum alone, her weight loss is fine and we decided as a family to shed off excess weight. #healthyliving." The Karanjas have been going through a tough time trying to fight for justice after they lost their daughter/sister Tecra Muigai in an accident, while with her boyfriend Lari in Lamu. Their business, Keroche Breweries, has also been facing hard times after they were asked to pay billions in taxes by the Kenyan government.
