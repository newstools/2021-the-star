The identical twin sisters, four years old, were so adorable that they turned heads and received compliments wherever they went. Two weeks ago, they were playing outside their Mauna home in Ugenya, Siaya, as their mother prepared lunch. When food was ready, they had vanished. That was on March 6. A frantic search has beenÂ  underway but there's no sign of the girls, Joyline Apiyo and Janet Adongo. Emily Akinyi let them play in the compound as she fixed lunch. Neighbours tried to help, without success. The disappearance was reported at Mboise police station in Ugunja on the day they vanished, under OB number 07/06/03/2021. Police say the early days after a child goes missing offers the best chance of findng them. The more time goes by, the more difficult it gets. "The girls had not left the compound. They were just playing outside when I suddenly couldn't hear them anymore,"a sobbing Akinyi told the Star. The twins are her only children. Her husband is dead. They were to start schooling in July this year. After their disappearance, their mother said police officers from the station joined her in searching, following suggestions by neighbours. "We have done everything possible in the search. We have asked around about who could have spotted them. Not even a trace has surfaced," she said. People had been admiring the twins, she said, adding that she suspects they were kidnapped by an admirer. "It is clear someone had been timing me, admiring the twins from afar and stolen them," their mother said. She said usually the twins would be playing with other children at home but on that day they were alone. There was no witness to give an account. Anybody with information that can help reunite the girls and their distraught mother can reach them through 0722 422 611/0723 790 814/0718 697 586. (Edited by V. Graham)
