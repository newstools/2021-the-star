Fish traders at Marenga Beach in Bunyala subcounty on Tuesday staged a peaceful demonstration accusing a foreign middleman of hurting business. They complained they have been incurring losses since the middleman from Nairobi joined the fish business last week. “This trader has come to purchase fish at a retail price, rendering a number of traders jobless,” Gladys Achola said, adding the foreigner deals directly with  fishermen. Achola said the buyer purchases fish at Sh280 per kilo, above the usual price of Sh250 offered by the local traders. “This middleman has employed only two people, rendering more than 100 fish traders and their employees jobless,” she said. Their complaints to the Beach Management Unit have fallen on deaf ears, she said. The traders demanded the removal of BMU chairman Robert Anema, saying he has stayed on for 13 years, far more than the stipulated four years. Fisherman Francis Odongo, however, condemned the traders for the demonstration that lasted for five hours ,without consulting them. “We want peace within the beach,” he said, adding that traders have only a 10 per cent share in the fish business. Other fishermen interviewed welcomed the middleman, arguing his prices were fair, and he had a right to trade anywhere within the country. Bunyala assistant county commissioner Franklin Ongori ordered the demonstrators to disperse as the national administration officers and security agents discussed the issue with BMU officials.
