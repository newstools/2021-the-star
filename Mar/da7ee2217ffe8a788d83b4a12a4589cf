A man whose marriage was nullified under Islamic law is challenging the jurisdiction of the Kadhi’s courts to determine issues touching on maintenance and custody of children. The man identified as AS says despite the fact that he challenged the competence of Kadhi’s courts, the court went ahead and adjudicated issues touching on children maintenance and custody. Though his grounds for opposition are yet to be heard and determined, he faces danger of being arrested for failing to obey orders issued by a Kadhi’s court and now wants the High Court to intervene. He wants the High Court to come to his rescue, failing which a warrant for his arrest issued by Khadi's court will be enforced. AS in his suit papers said he was married under Islamic law but when it became unbearable, they divorced legally. He filed his grounds of opposition challenging the jurisdiction of the Kadhi’s court. But he has not managed to prosecute his grounds of opposition due to effects of Covid-19, which disrupted court operations. However, on January 27 his ex-wife demanded that he be summoned to show cause why he should not be punished for disobeying a court order. When the matter came up for hearing, AS was out of the country and this forced the parties to take another date, March 18. His lawyers asked the court to first hear his grounds of opposition and dispense with them before embarking on the issues of notice to show cause. The court then declined to hear the grounds of opposition. He now wants the High Court to come to his rescue or he will be arrested. Edited by Henry Makori
