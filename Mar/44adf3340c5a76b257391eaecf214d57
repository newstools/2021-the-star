More than 500 Class 6 and 7 learners were without desks and learning materials after a fire on Sunday gutted seven classrooms at Riruta Satellite Primary School. The fire is said to have been caused by an electrical fault, investigations were underway by Nairobi fire and police authorities. No injuries were reported. Since schools reopened in January, 34 fires have broken out, including at Riruta. Most have been blamed on student unrest and arson. A few were caused by electrical faults. Headteacher Agnes Muchiri on Monday told the Star the fire had brought teaching and learning to a halt. More than 300 desks were destroyed as well as numerous textbooks and learning materials. “The situation is not good, pupils do not have books, seven classes have been destroyed and it seems they cannot be habitable anymore. "Around 520 pupils have nowhere to stay but we have combined them in classes,” Muchiri said. When the Star visited the school on Monday, Class 7 pupils had been relocated to the school hall. The school caretaker said the fire broke out shortly after 3pm and burned until late at night. He said the construction of the school roof could have fuelled the fire. “The classes have a double ceiling, one underneath the other one, and this [space with oxygen] could have increased the intensity of the fire,” he told the Star, requesting anonymity. Muchiri urged the county government to assist them in getting more desks and reconstructing the razed classrooms. “We are in dire need of desks, textbooks and stationery so learning can resume as soon as possible," she said. "Otherwise, our students are safe, our teachers are also safe, we gave them counselling in the morning and everyone is now sober and ready to resume learning." (Edited by V. Graham)
