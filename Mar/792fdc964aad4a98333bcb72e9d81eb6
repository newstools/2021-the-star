The Entertainment and Hospitality industry players on Wednesday took to the streets to condemn the government's order on closure of businesses, a measure taken to curb the spread of Covid-19. This comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta last week announced the cessation of movement in five counties; Nairobi, Kajiado, Kiambu, Machakos and Nakuru, terming the areas as a fast-spreading virus zone. The stakeholders called on the government to lift the order on the closure of their businesses as they are now jobless. Carrying placards with different messages, the demonstrators aired their grievances as they lamented their predicaments. Uhuru on March 26 ordered the cessation of movement, closing of bars and restaurants which will only operate on a takeaway basis, social gatherings with some being limited to a certain number of attendees like funerals and weddings and curfew hours were changed to 8 pm-4 am. However, all other counties outside the five locked counties, will not be affected by the new directives, but the President said that changes might be made if other counties do not adhere to the directives set. During the address, the President directed that the sale of alcohol and eateries in the five counties be prohibited and that all hotels and restaurants provide take-away services only. "The operations of bars, restaurants and eateries in the other 42 Counties shall continue as is, but they shall at all times be conducted in strict fidelity to Ministry of Health Guidelines, failure to which appropriate action against management, staff, patrons, and premises shall be taken," he said. He also directed that all employers and enterprises of whatever nature including public bodies, the private sector, government offices, and others to allow employees to work from home, with the exception of employees working in critical or essential services.
