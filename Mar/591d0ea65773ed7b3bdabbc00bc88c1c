Luanda will get a fire engine after completion of spatial planning to upgrade the town to a municipality, Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has said. The county has already allocated Sh10 million to the plan. The governor said Luanda would be upgraded to modern standards and create favourable business space. He said those on road reserves will have to surrender these spaces to the municipality for the expansion of the town. “We have experts on the ground for that work and once they are through, the required procedure to upgrade it to municipal will take place,” Ottichilo said on Sunday. Ottichilo spoke in Luanda town when the business community fundraised for their colleagues whose shops were destroyed by fire over a week ago.They raised Sh1.3 million. The cause of the fire is still unknown. Nominated MP Godfrey Ososti urged Ottichilo’s administration to put in place a fire management plan for Luanda market, saying it is the leading revenue generating market within the county. The MP said the market serves five counties – Vihiga, Kisumu, Siaya, Kakamega and Busia. “Luanda is also an important transit town to Uganda and the Great Lakes region, therefore its safety must be prioritised,” he said. Osotsi donated building materials worth sh100,000 to construct the damaged buildings. MCA Tom Atingo was impressed with the unity of Luanda's business community. "Luanda is a cosmopolitan town with all subtribes. Your unity speaks a lot," he said. "We politicians must watch our mouths at all times, as we are the ones who bring these innocent fights," he added.
