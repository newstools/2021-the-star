Reigning national champions Ulinzi Warriors play Umoja in a Kenya Basketball Federation Premier League week 2 tie at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium. The soldiers, who struggled before beating Eldonets 58-52 in their opening fixture two weeks ago, will have to be at their best. National team assistant captain Eric Mutoro, fresh from his exploits in Cameroon with Morans, will lead a strong Warriors' charge in the match. In that opener, coach William Balozi believes they  remain the side to beat although they are still not at their sharpest. Last year's runner-up Thunder have lost key players this season but in Griffin Ligare, they still have a star to to bank on. They welcome Lakeside from Kisumu who also have a baptism of fire against Emyba. Emyba will be going for nothing but maximum points in what should be a closely pitted duel. Newly-promoted University of Nairobi "Terrorists" play Emyba who also had a false start, going down 77-68 to former champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). In the ladies' league, a rejuvenated Storms face off against Kisumu's  Lady Bucks who are making a return to the top tier. On Sunday, Strathmore University Blades tackle Kenya College of Accountancy University  (KCA) side who lost 65- 41 to KPA. Strathmore University Swords who are eyeing a  top four finish open their campaign with a match against Kisumu Lady Bucks. Apart from the premier ties, there will be a total of 12 lower division matches on the card at the Moran Lounge along Kiambu Road.
