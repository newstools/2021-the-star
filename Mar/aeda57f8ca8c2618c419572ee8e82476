Everton vs Burnley Saturday 8:30 pm Despite a 2-0 defeat in their last away game, in which Everton registered a record 53rd own goal in the Premier League, the feel-good factor still remains for the ‘Toffees’, who had won their three matches prior. Who scores first is usually key to their success or failure, as Carlo Ancelotti’s side have won 13 of the 15 league matches in which they broke the deadlock, but lost eight of 12 in which their opponent did. Everton remain in the hunt for a top-four finish, but their league home form has been lacking. That’s highlighted by the fact they’ve lost more than they’ve won here, whilst also registering just two clean sheets. Notably, the bulk of the goals they conceded arrived after half time. Burnley have only lost one of their previous seven league matches but draws dominated that run. Burnley have conceded over twice as many goals as they’ve scored inside the game’s first 30 minutes. Whilst many of wins in recent matches have come at home, they’ve impressively won three of their previous five fixtures on the road, each time ‘to nil’. However, Burnley have lost all five of their away matches vs sides currently inside the top seven.

Fatigue from a grueling 2-2 draw with Sevilla may yet appear, and indeed, as they have lost 60 per cent of their last five post-Champions League games, all at home with two-plus goals conceded. However, Dortmund’s last six wins obtained immediately after a Champions League game have each come with a handicap-beating clean, with three 4-0 scorelines. Any win might, as each saw at least 50 per cent of the goals arrive in the second half, and curiously, the same trait applies to Dortmund’s five home Bundesliga clean-sheet victories to date this term. Hertha Berlin entered the new week hovering one place above the relegation playoff berth, but their last outing did produce a much-needed victory, which bookended a nine-game winless run. Hertha trailed at half-time in five of those seven losses and conceded an average of 1.43 goals beyond the hour mark across them. Hertha should be faithful underdogs here. They are winless in road trips since the end of the November international break, and also without victory in six league trips here.

Torino still have their two recently postponed games in hand, but are back in the relegation zone, partly due to their league-high of 11 stalemates. The hosts are still the only team yet to win at home in this season. They have drawn five consecutive top-flight matches here (all returning under 2.5 total goals) for the first time ever, and there has been no goal scored before half time in five consecutive Serie ‘A’ matches at Stadio Olimpico. Internazionale are marching towards a first league title since 2010 after seven straight victories, keeping a clean sheet in five. While Inter would like an early goal, they have no reason to rush into this game, as they have won a league-high eight matches from a level HT score, while winning after a first-half defeat in both of the last two head-to-heads. Close to half of Inter’s last 13 league away wins against an eventually-relegated side have specifically ended 2-1. Inter are impressively unbeaten on the road in seven competitive matches, trailing at half time just once during the run.
