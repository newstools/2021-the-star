Residents of Hindi in Lamu county are suffereing following water shortage in the area for months. This is after their pipe was destroyed years ago. The residents have been forced to spend many hours in search of water after authorities failed to repair the only pipeline in the area. Athman Mohamed, a resident, said the affected places are Bargoni, Mswafini, Bodhai and other villages along the area. Their only hope of getting water was from the KDF camp in Bargoni but it developed mechanical problems forcing them to walk for long distance in search of the commodity. Those who can afford boda boda to transport water do it but the majority are poor and have to go the hard way. The water kiosk which was a project built by the previous county government regime is locked as taps are dry. Mohamed said at times they get supplied with water from bowsers but they are not enough. “We appeal to the government and non-governmental organisations to intervene so that we get fresh water,” he said in an interview. Mohamed said the problem has been worse in the last four months since it is dry season and they can stay for three days without bathing. Abdallah Mohamed an Imam from Bargoni said they have had challenges for a long and would like a permanent solution. He said most of the challenges are usually experienced during the dry season when even getting food for children is a problem. Previously he said they used to get support from Amu power but now it's only KDF who assists them with water which is not enough. “Right now there are few people in the village because people have gone out to look for water,” he said. Mariam Abdallah, a resident, said they normally go to borrow water from KDF but for the last one week there was no water as their water pump was spoilt. “We fetch water from Gobo now and it's Sh5 per jerry can so if one does not have money they can not get water‚” she said.
