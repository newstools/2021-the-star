Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Thursday received 100,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines donated by the government of India. The CS expressed gratitude on behalf of Kenya for the Indian Government's generosity. The doses will reinforce the 1.25 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine which was received two weeks ago. The vaccines were transported by UNICEF as part of the COVAX facility, which aims to provide equitable access to vaccines for all countries around the world. The Ministry of Health has already commenced Vaccination exercise with healthcare workers, teachers and police officers at the frontline. The first consignment of 1.02 million doses is part of an initial allocation to Kenya of 3.56 million doses. In addition, UNICEF is providing 1,025,000 syringes and 10,250 safety boxes to Kenya, via a global stockpile funded and supported by Gavi. Support is being provided to counter myths and misconceptions about COVID vaccines and to encourage people to get the vaccine as it becomes available to them.
