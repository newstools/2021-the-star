Most people switched to other messaging applications such as Telegram due to the changes announced by WhatsApp on their privacy policy. Telegram made gains during this period as people downloaded and started using this platform. It is free to use and has updated features that can help you when using this messaging app. One of the updates that have taken place is that your account will be deleted automatically if you do not use it for six months. Your messages and contacts will also be deleted if you do not come online during that period. You can change the settings by going to the privacy and security section then you scroll down to find the "delete my account" option and you change the settings. Adding a fingerprint lock or passcode is another feature updated. In order for you to add a fingerprint lock, you will need to first set a passcode lock.  You can either add a PIN or password and once you are done, it will show you the “Unlock with fingerprint" option. As per your preference, you can disable or enable it and when you enable it you do not need to enter a PIN or password every time you open the application. There are also privacy settings for forwarded messages as a new update. This is one of its greatest features. If you have forwarded a message, then the receiver can check the original source but also adds a link to his/her account. If you are concerned about your privacy, you can change this. Telegram gives you five different chat colour themes and the best part is that you can also change the colour of recipients messages, your messages and chat background. You also get unlimited background patterns and you can even add solid background colours. Another best feature added to this messaging app is that you can edit or schedule messages. The maximum time you get to edit your text messages is two days after they are sent and this feature is available for both private chats and groups.
