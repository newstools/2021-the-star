Kenya College of Accountancy (KCA) University coach Charles Goro is optimistic the team will bounce back despite losing three Premier League matches in a row. Speaking after losing 96-42 to reigning champions Ulinzi Warriors at Nyayo Stadium, the coach said: “I am so much under-strength. I am missing most of my key players who have not reported back for training. The new boys I have are trying their level best but they will take time to adapt.” He added: “I am really missing the low post players because that is where we are not getting results. But things will change in May when second and third year students are back in class.” Ulinzi took the first two quarter 28-19 and 22-15 and easily rolled away. James Mwangi posted 27 points, Eric Mutoro tallied 21 points and John Washika added 14. Brian Ondari hit 12 for KCA. Strathmore University Blades subjected struggling Umoja to another loss, defeating them 65-41 in another game. National team forward Fidel Okoth registered 11 points for the winners while Collins Sudi posted 12 for Umoja. “I only used two of my main players Fidel (Okoth) and Cliff (Alela) and still got the result I needed. The boys had a solid game,” said Blades coach Tony Ochieng. It was a different story for their women counterparts Strathmore University Swords, who were beaten by Storms. “We missed 19 free throws that should have made the difference. I am building a new team and with time, things will be well,” said coach Ronny Owino. At the Manyatta’s Gonda courts in Kisumu, Eldonets pinned down home side Lakeside 68-66 in a closely fought tie. “We went at them aggressively in the deciding quarter and managed to carry the day,” explained the visitors coach Maurice Ouma.
