Newcastle United forwards Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin will be out until April due to knee and groin injuries respectively, the Premier League club said on Tuesday. Both players sustained the injuries in Saturday’s 1-1 Premier League draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Almiron was replaced at halftime and Saint-Maximin limped off in the 63rd minute. “Both have undergone scans and will continue their rehabilitation with the club’s medical team,” Newcastle said in a statement. Newcastle are 17th in the table with 26 points from 26 games, three points above the relegation zone. They travel to second-bottom West Bromwich Albion on Sunday. Meanwhile, Bournemouth and Watford have been charged by the FA after their Championship match on Saturday descended into chaos as a brawl broke out in the closing stages. Both sets of players clashed in the 96th minute after Watford forward Joao Pedro was dismissed for a second yellow card following a late tackle on Bournemouth midfielder Jefferson Lerma. Bournemouth’s Jack Wilshere was also sent off at the Vitality Stadium following an altercation with Watford skipper Tom Cleverley during the melee. “Both clubs allegedly failed to ensure that their players and/or club officials conducted themselves in an orderly fashion during the 96th minute of the fixture and they have until Friday, March 5 to provide their responses,” the FA said in a statement.
