Singer Otile Brown says it is not easy for one to make it in the Kenyan music industry. Most 'big artistes' have or had godfathers who helped them, he said on Instagram. "Even now that they’ve made it, their godfathers are still putting money in their projects. Our growth has to be slow and gradual. No label, no investors and remember, we ain’t from rich families." Otile added that Kenyan artistes struggle to make ends meet because they don’t earn enough. "We have to balance the little we get to pay bills, take care of our families and invest back in the business," he said. "We’ve been failed by our government, media and even some of the selfish stakeholders in the media business, e.g., music distributors, who take advantage of artistes." Otile concluded that he is okay with his gradual growth."Just stop thinking and saying that we ain’t putting in enough effort."
