Vera Sidika says she is no longer interested in dating rich men. In a Q and A session with her fans, Vera defended dating and eventually marrying Brown Mauzo, a Coast-based musician who is not a millionaire yet. A fan asked her why she settled for less in relationships. Vera responded, "I have never settled for less because I have been content and genuinely happy in my relationships." Vera then asked, "What is settling for less to you? A man thatâ€™s not rich? Is a good relationship measured by how rich your man is?" Giving her own life experience with dating rich men, Vera said she would never want to go back to dating rich men. "I have dated millionaires, billionaires, etc., you name it. So, been there, done that. I know how that world looks like," she said. "I would never want to do that to myself. My freedom and happiness comes first. Is it life when all your man can offer is material things? And track all your moves, asks you to delete social media, disconnects you from friends and controls your life?" She added, "Emotionally unavailable, only thinks money solves everything, disrespects u because they feel like they own u, are unavailable coz they are too busy for u, ai! That life apana! "The only small happiness you get is going shopping, but once you get home, you stare at those items & still be lonely as f***!" She concluded, "Imagine being in a relationship but feeling so single! In fact, single people enjoy coz they go on dates. This is misery!" Edited by T Jalio
