A Homa Bay county official has asked parents to give their children all the support they need to boost their performance in this year's KCPE examinations. County secretary Isaiah Ogwe said learners need an environment conducive to their studies to post exemplary scores. Ogwe said candidates might have been affected by the long stay outside schools due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We understand the hard economic situation coronavirus subjected many parents to. But let’s strive to provide the necessary support for learners to better their performance,” Ogwe said. He spoke on Wednesday at Nyabera Primary in Ruma Kaksinri ward, Suba South constituency, during the release of mock exams for Standard 8 candidates from 18 schools. Ruma Kaksingri MCA Eliphalet Osuri was present. The county secretary said he sponsored the exams to enable teachers and education stakeholders to assess the candidates' preparedness for this year’s KCPE exams. Some 322 candidates took the test. “Both teachers and students from the schools now know where they need to put more attention before KCPE. They can improve in those areas they lag behind,” he said. Ogwe distributed success cards and materials for exams. “Many parents are unable to buy their children those materials required during examination hence we chipped in,” Ogwe said. Osuri asked school heads not to send candidates home for fees to enable them to have adequate time to prepare for exams. “I appeal to parents to provide the necessary support to the candidates who are going to sit exams to enable them to get courage,” Osuri said. Suba subcounty Kepssha chairman Omondi Ojwala said the mock exams and rewards given by Ogwe have boosted their morale. “We’re going to do all that is necessary to ensure we improve the academic performance of our schools,” Ojwala said. Dorothy Otieno, a parent, asked for the continued support of girls' education. (edited by o. owino)
