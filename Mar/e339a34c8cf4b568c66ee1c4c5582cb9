 Governor Charity Ngiluâ€™s nominees to the Kitui County Public Service Board who were last year rejected by MCAs are among those to be interviewed for the jobs. The county assembly said the nominees were not qualified for the jobs but they have been shortlisted for interviews by an independent selection panel. The interviews commenced on Tuesday morning. The Kitui CPSB chairperson and members selection panel chaired by Necodemus Kisengese invited five people for interviews for the position of the chairperson and 28 others to be considered for positions of board members. Among those seeking to be board members is Francis Kiliku who was last year nominated to the position of the board chairman by Ngilu before the county assembly declined to approve the nomination. He now wants to become a board member. Others who were last year rejected by MCAs alongside Kiliku are David Munyao, Esther Muthui, Joseph Kyavoa and Benard Munyasya. Residents will be watching how the MCAs will handle any on the shortlisted candidates who were previously rejected should the Kisengese team forward their names for vetting. Some 28 people applied for the position of board chairman while another 78 sought to become board members.  Edited by P.O
