The man who pleaded guilty to attempting to extort Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip has been sentenced to one year in jail. Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku has sentenced Jones Ochieng Mbolo to one year behind bars or pay an alternative fine of Sh200,000. Mbolo pleased confessed to attempting to extort Sh 200,000 from the senator by threatening to expose on social media a video of him with his female friend Aeedah Ahmed. Mutuku said Mbolo did not seem remorseful and was therefore not suitable for a non-custodial sentence. The court noted that even after giving him time to do soul searching he is still not remorseful. Mbolo had pleaded with the magistrate to give him a non-custodial sentence saying he will not repeat it and will report to the probation officer daily. Mbolo also said the reason he released the senator's video is that he insulted him. He further claimed that the probation report was not correct on his financial status which said that he does not have any money as he had earlier claimed. Mbolo said that he has Sh3.5 million in locked savings at a local bank and if given his phone he would show the court his balance. However, he agreed with his sister that he stays in a one-roomed house in Kasarani and depends on her for upkeep. He claimed that the reason why the sister is not aware of his millions was that he is the only man in the home he can't disclose that information to her. The probation officer had noted that he has a problem of lying and pretending to live a lavish life which he does not.
