Iconic gospel group MTN Joyous Celebration have been signed by Universal Music Africa, a division of Universal Music Group. Backed by US-based label Motown Gospel, which will release the group’s music in the US and Canada, this signing comes as the award-winning ensemble celebrates its silver jubilee and prepares for the release of its 25th album this Easter. Sipho Dlamini, UMG CEO South Africa and Sub Saharan Africa, said the group has enjoyed unparalleled success over the last 25 years. “They have entertained and inspired Africans and the world with their take on gospel and inspirational music,” he said. He said the band has also birthed a number of superstars who have achieved great success, testament of how strong the foundation Joyous provided them. The group was founded by three partners, Dr Lindelani Mkhize, Jabu Hlongwane and Mthunzi Namba, who continue to serve in different roles. Mkhize said, “We are delighted to be on this new direction with a fresh new purpose. We are revived, we have a new energy as we turn things around to get to the next extraordinary level.” Hlongwane said, “There’s been crazy ups and downs but we are here. This milestone album is special to us, 25 years is not a short time. We are particularly pleased that this partnership is opening us up to new territories, new things, new outlook. We needed the change." Adding, "We also want to say to the people that the 25th instalment of Joyous Celebration is being cooked, and they should expect it soon. It’s going to be ready before Easter.”
