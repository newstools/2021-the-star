Sauti Sol's docu-reality series 'Sol Family' is back on Showmax for a second season from March 15. Sol Family, which premiered in August 2020, took fans behind the scenes into the lives of Bien, Savara, Chimano and Polycarp, the four members who make up Sauti Sol, as well as their Sol Generation protégés Nviiri the Storyteller and Bensoul. Sharing his excitement about the upcoming new season, producer Eugene Mbugua called season one a “resounding success”, especially among the many Sol Generation fans, who felt that they got to know and relate with their stars better. As to what fans can expect in season two, Mbugua said they have an exciting season lined up which they have been filming since July last year. “We’ll give the audience a more in-depth look into the couples on the show. We’ll also get to take you behind the scenes of what happens when Sauti Sol, Nviiri and Bensoul hit the stage.” While their biggest challenge filming Season One was Covid-19, Mbugua reveals that things have been much easier this season after some restrictions were lifted. As such, the audience will also get to follow Sauti Sol and Sol Generation for an out-of-town experience as the show travels to Meru, Diani and even Lamu.
