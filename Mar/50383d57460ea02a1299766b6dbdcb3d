Peter Wangai was arraigned on Thursday before Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku and pleaded not guilty to the offence. He has denied 21 counts of fraud related to the said scam. Lawyers representing the victims who lost money told the court that Wangai should deposit his passport in court because he is a flight risk. They told the court that two other directors have since fled to South Africa Wangai's lawyer has dismissed the allegations by the victims and told the court that his client was the only director of Goldenscape. Mutuku released him on a Sh5 million bond or a Sh2 million cash bail. The case will be mentioned on April 1.
