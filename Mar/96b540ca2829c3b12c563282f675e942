Elgeyo Marakwet Deputy Governor Wiseley Kipkurui Rotich was on Thursday charged before an Edoret court with obtaining goods by false pretense and issuing a bad cheque. The DG was arrested in Eldoret and presented before Chief Magistrate Linus Khaisan where he was charged with unlawfully obtaining 14 tyres and one lorry battery all valued at Sh351,000. It’s alleged that he committed the offense on August 3, 2018 at Eri Suppllies Limited in Eldoret town. “Its not true your hounour”, said Rotich when the charges were read to him. The goods were from businessman Rajesh Sanghrajka and Rotich is accused of obtaining them in Iten while pretending that he was in position to pay him, a fact which he knew to be false. He was also charged that on November 12, 2019 at Eldoret town, he issued a cheque for Sh351,000 to Eri Suppllies at Trans National bank Iten branch with the knowledge that his account had insufficient funds. He denied the charges and was released on a cash bail of Sh50,000. The case will be mentioned on June 28. Present at the court were Soy MP Caleb Kositany along with several MCAs from Elgeyo Marakwet. They termed the case political, noting that it came just a day after MCAs in the county rejected the BBI bill. Rotich had also a few days before, hosted DP Wiliam Ruto in the town for a boda boda fundraising. Rotich is at political loggerheads with his boss - Governor Alex Tolgos - who is not allied to the DP and is chairman of the BBI in the Rift Valley region.
