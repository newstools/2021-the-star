Former UNCTAD boss Mukhisa Kituyi home coming ceremony met a hostile reception and low turn outs with residents jeering him during stop overs . At the Matulo airstrip where he landed, only a few residents turned up with those in attendance castigating him for failing to help the region when he was in high office. “You never helped us when you were minister and in foreign mission," the crowd shouted amid chants 'hatukutaki hatukutaki”. He was forced to change his route after word went round that rowdy youths were planning to disrupt his stop overs. Mukhisa was supposed to hold a rally at posta grounds . While addressing residents at various stop overs, Mukhisa said he was going to meet several Luhya stakeholders and implore them ahead of 2022. “I am going to meet every leader be it elders and teacher leaders so that we start this journey," he said. Mukhisa entry into the presidential race has met sharp criticism from leaders close to Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula and Musalia Mudavadi. In his Mbakalo home, 2022 succession politics took center stage with Makueni governor Kivutha Kibwana drumming up support for him. Kibwana said Mukhisa was the only remedy to the ailing economy of the country. Tonagren MP Eseli Simiyu said Mukhisa was the best person from the region to clinch the seat . “Finally we have a courageous leader going for the top seat, a person who was courageous enough to leave his well paying job to come and serve the people of Kenya,”said Eseli. Mukhisa is the latest entrant into the presidential race, with next year's general election still 17 months away. Kituyi said rejuvenating the economy will top his priorities if elected. The ex-Unctad secretary-general said he is his own man and has been driven by convictions to improve the lives of Kenyans. “Don’t think Kituyi is anybody’s project. Tell me, who in this country can employ Kituyi as his project?” he asked.
