When Citizen TVâ€™s Trevor Ombija sought work in the city fresh from his Nyakach home, Robin Njogu came to his help. Heavy in Luo accent and green in radio broadcasting, Trevor had not worked anywhere else. Short on skill and experience, all he had was potential and Njogu saw it. At the time, Njogu was news manager at Nation Media Group. He tried Ombija on radio and it changed his life. Njogu succumbed to Covid-19 complications early this month. He was aged 45. The father of three was eulogised on Thursday during a service to celebrate his life in Nairobi as a radio chief who had an eye for talent. He knew how to scout a radio talent, nurturing them and letting them blossom. He started out as an intern at Capital FM, then went on to become a general news reporter before rising through the ranks to become the chief political reporter. At Capital, when Joseph Mate sought a job at the station's Lonrho House base, he was also rugged on skills and short on experience. But Njogu believed in his potential, handed him an audio recorder and sent him to cover a press conference. "You will go far young man if you maintain your smile and energy," he would tell him. He left the station in 2012 for Nation Media Group. Three years later, he went to Royal Media where he was in charge of all the 13 radio stations and digital division. And even in his new work station, he would not let a promising radio talent walk a way, however rugged. His wife Caro Robin remembered her husband as a committed family man who was in the delivery room for each of their three children. He would take personal interest in washing the children, changing their diapers, feeding them and soothing them to sleep. RMS boss Wachira Waruru eulogised the deceased as a fine journalist who was sharp and firm in his leadership, ensuring that the content on the 13 radio outlets was of high quality. The journalist had just lost his mother a few days before his death. Edited by Henry Makori
