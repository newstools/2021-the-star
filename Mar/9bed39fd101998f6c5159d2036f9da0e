Nyashinki's wife Zia Bett is opening a page on social media, Ketolife.ke, where she will be talking about healthy eating and workouts she incorporates. Zia revealed the plan a week after sharing a before and after picture of her weight loss. Nyashinski and his wife Zippy are parents of a one-year-old son, and the journey as parents has been kept under wraps. She wrote, "I've really debated posting this transformation, only cause I can't believe that's how I'd been walking these streets and no one told me but honestly, after bringing life to this world, anything beyond taking care of a newborn is a favour though for me." Adding, "I vividly remember looking in the mirror and just hating how I looked and felt. I didn't wanna feel like that anymore. I knew I could look better, I knew I could feel better."
