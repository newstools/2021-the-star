Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu on Tuesday urged lawyers not to be conduits through which judges are compromised. “Let no valid challenges to your ethical demeanour ever be raised. Be part of the change of the face of the legal profession and you shall transform the entire edifice of justice provision for all Kenyans,” said Mwilu during the swearing-in of new advocates. She advised the young lawyers to ensure their success in the profession is measured by how they keep fidelity to the oath of office and not by the content of their bank accounts or their popularity. “You must make a living, but do not let this be the foundation of your ethos as an advocate. Take your time, learn, grow, improve… money will come," she said. "Discard this ‘pop’ attitude; this fast-food get rich quick instant gratification that is popular culture these days. It is ok to be ambitious, it is ok to have high expectations, but these must be measured with patience, honesty, hard work and fortitude.” She said lawyers should always endeavour to do the right thing and address injustices in society even when it is detrimental to their interests. “Do the right thing. Do not be used as a tool for illegality, for political expediency, or for financial dishonesty. Your integrity, you carry that with you always.” Integrity should never be sacrificed for one to either fit in or maintain the status quo, she added. “With the utmost civility becoming of an advocate, you must not be afraid to speak to the facts, to strip away pretence and make others uncomfortable, provided that sense of discomfort derives from the acknowledgement of the truth and that you are doing the right thing." Mwilu gave the young lawyers her own example, saying her path as a judge and a leader in the Judiciary has been fraught with challenges. She added, however, that that should not dissuade anyone from doing the right thing and staying the course.
