One Mic, Kenya’s number–one ranked spoken word event, on Sunday celebrated its second anniversary at Chester House in CBD, Nairobi. The youthful occasion featured amazing skits from upcoming and featured artistes. Michael Stanley the poet wowed with a thrilling love poem. Poet Andrew, the founder of One Mic, said, “Art makes us find ourselves and lose ourselves as well, the reason as to why we non-selectively give an opportunity and a free platform to all artistes especially upcoming ones, to perform, learn, discover and exploit their talents.”
