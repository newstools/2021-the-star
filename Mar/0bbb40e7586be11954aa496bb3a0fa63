ODM leader Raila Odinga has led Kenyans in celebrating the International Women's Day held annually on March 8. Via Social media on Monday, Raila said Kenya celebrates all women. "We celebrate you! Throughout history, you have and always continue to make countless sacrifices for Nations and humanity," Raila said as he posted pictures of his wife Ida and other women. "Happy #InternationalWomensDay to all our wonderful women out there! Proud of you!." Senate speaker Ken Lusaka said an equal world is a better and more prosperous world. International Women's Day is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating women's equality. The theme of this year is Let's choose to challenge. For more than 100 years, this day has been celebrated by honoring the achievements of women globally. But this year, because of lost jobs and increased burdens of care at home, women have fared worse economically than men. According to the International Labour Organization, a United Nations agency, globally women have suffered more job losses related to the pandemic than men. About 5 per cent of women in 2020 lost work, which could mean losing a job or experiencing reduced hours, compared with 3.9 per cent of men. According to International Women's Day website,  Individuals and organizations are invited to send in their #ChooseToChallenge images. One is expected to strike the #ChooseToChallenge pose with your hand high to show your commitment to choose to challenge inequality, call out bias, question stereotypes, and help forge an inclusive world. Submissions are photographs of individual or group compositions striking the #ChooseToChallenge hand up pose to potentially be shared on the IWD website and social media feeds - and are ideally 16:9 aspect ratio (landscape composition; max 3000 pixels width).
