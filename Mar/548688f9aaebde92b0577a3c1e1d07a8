Gor Mahia's newly acquired star Wilson Silva has been singled out for praise by  head coach Vaz Pinto following his impressive performance in their match against Kakamega Homeboyz at Bukhungu Stadium on Wednesday. Pinto commended Silva for being brave and energetic in his debut against "one of the toughest sides in the Football Kenya Federation Premier League. "The Brazilian attacking midfielder endeared himself to the club after his great exploits clinched a winning goal in stoppage time against Kakamega Homeboyz whom they beat 2-1 in the closely contested encounter that could have gone either way. “Wilson has surprised everyone for adapting fast in the team and displaying a wonderful play against Homeboyz which shows that he is ready for the tough and competitive Kenya premier league. “He understands how to use the space and he is very good in pressing the opponents which are the best attributes of the team. "As we move forward, I believe it was a wise decision bringing him on board which gave us an added value as a club. "I think other players will learn one or two things from him because we believe in team work and that’s the spirit we expect from each player as we move forward in defending the title that I feel it’s still within our reach,” he observed. Pinto also praised another prodigy John Macharia who should have put his name on the scoresheet were it not for the heroic saves pulled off by Homeboyz shot-stopper Godfrey Oputi. Macharia did the spade work that led to Tito Okello’s equaliser.“It’s good to have this kind of players who create something out of nothing and we believe this will create more internal competition which will enable us to achieve our objectives as we settle down having had a bad start,” he added. The head coach was excited for having collected maximum points and promised to build on the outcome to help the reigning champions find their footing on the log.
