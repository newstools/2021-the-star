Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu has announced the closure of Chuka Law Courts for a period of 10 days after five staffers tested positive for coronavirus. Mwilu said in a statement on Wednesday that by Tuesday, five personnel had tested positive for Covid-19 with another three tests returning inconclusive results. “We have arrived at the considered decision to temporarily close Chuka Law Courts for a period of ten days from today. The closure will enable all personnel at the station to be screened and undergo a Covid-19 testing exercise that will be undertaken by the Tharaka Nithi County Ministry of Health Services and Sanitation,” Mwilu said. She added that the closure will enable thorough fumigation of the Chuka Law Courts buildings, enable any affected personnel to quarantine in adherence to Covid-19 protocols, and contribute towards breaking the chain of transmission. Mwilu said the affected staff members work in the Civil Registry of the High Court and the Accounts Department at Chuka Law Courts. The total number of personnel at Chuka Law Courts is forty-eight. All affected personnel are currently under self-isolation and quarantine as per Ministry of Health Covid-19 protocols. During the period of closure, all urgent matters for the Magistrates’ Courts at Chuka Law Courts shall be directed to Runyenjes Law Courts. All urgent matters for the ELC at Chuka shall be directed to the ELC at Embu and all urgent matters for the High Court at Chuka shall be directed to the High Court at Embu. The closure comes two days after the Meru Law Courts was closed for seven days following a reported case of the coronavirus. A staffer at the Meru court succumbed to Covid-19 related health complications on Sunday evening.
