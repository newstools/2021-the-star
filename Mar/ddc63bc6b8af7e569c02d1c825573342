Stamp out any cases of cheating because we are here to support you, Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia has said. Macharia told teachers while presiding over the opening of examination materials at the Kisumu Offices. “There are those teachers that I don't know why they panic sometimes. They open the wrong papers and close again, when we go there, we have to interdict them. We are just here to encourage you and not to punish you so ensure that that the job is done," she said. Macharia said 227,700 teachers, manning both the KCPE and KCSE, have been vetted and should not let them down. “A lot of work has been done in preparation for this examination by the multi agency team and we must keep the eye on the goal because if we have made all this reparation and miss the target, all this will go down the drain” She further noted that Knec has made arrangements to ensure candidates whose schools were closed or moved to other examination centers are allowed to sit their exams. Currently 1.2 million candidate shave been registered for the 2020 KCPE. Kisumu county Education director Issack Atebe noted that Kisumu has seven containers within the county. The county has 33,724 candidates in KCPE.
