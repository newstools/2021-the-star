Many Kenyans have thrown caution to the wind by not following Covid-19 safety protocols, Vihiga health executive Amos Kutwa has said. He urged residents to adhere to all the protocols put in place by the government to prevent the spread of the virus that is sweeping across the country. “The outbreak of coronavirus pandemic continues to affect all aspects of our daily lives. Over the past few days, we have experienced a resurgence of the deadly disease in our community,” Kutwa said on Wednesday. He said the current third wave of the virus has been described as more deadly and is spreading fast. “The health department is urging the people of Vihiga to faithfully stick to health guidelines and other protocols to help curb the spread of the contagion,” Kutwa appealed. According to County Disease Surveillance Records, as of Tuesday, the county had  cumulatively registered 159 cases from a sample of 2,278 people since the virus hit the country in March last year. “We have lost seven patients, including one health worker, to the pandemic so far,” Kutwa said He said the county had installed five ICU beds at Vihiga County Referral Hospital. “We are finalising piping works at the oxygen plant that was recently installed at the county referral hospital. We envisage that the ICU unit will begin to operate early next month,” Kutwa said. The new ICU centre was built using the Sh60 million Covid-19 conditional grants from the national government. On the Covid-19 vaccination drive, the county health boss called upon the targeted group of frontline health workers, teachers, security officers and religious leaders to ensure they have been inoculated. “A total of 474 individuals had received the jab by Tuesday,” Kutwa said.
