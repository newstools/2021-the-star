Mau Mau veterans have urged members of Parliament to pass the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment)Bill, 2020 to unify the country. Led by Mzee Gito Kahengeri, who is the secretary general of the Mau Mau War Veterans Association, the group on Tuesday said the BBI Bill will bring Kenyans together and make them work peacefully. "Mau Mau Veterans Association is in love with BBI and urge you to pass it for the present and future generations," Kahengeri said. Kahengeri spoke when he made a presentation to the joint Justice and Legal Affairs Committees during the hearing on the Bill in Parliament. He said that BBI will develop and cultivate unity of the people of Kenya, bring inclusivity and empower the youth. "BBI will enact strong efficient laws to fight corruption and create strong love and help future generations," he said. While narrating to MPs how colonists denied them an opportunity to pursue education, Mzee Kahengeri said that BBI will liberate the youth. Mzee Kahengeri said that colonists ensured that no African went beyond standard four, adding that the aim was to build a cheap and uneducated community who could only work on coffee farms.
