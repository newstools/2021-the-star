Kirinyaga will put up a fully equipped Sh70 million fire station in Kutus. Governor Anne Waiguru said construction works will be completed by July. The Sh70 million will help in the purchase of two fire engines One fire engine-bowser has been broken down and the county has been criticised for late responses to fires. The fire station will have quarters for firemen and officers so they can respond swiftly to fires. Firemen will also receive training in modern techniques to contain and put out fires. “We inherited the fire water bowser (fire engine) from the previous administration and it has a broken pump but we will rehabilitate so we have three fire engines," Waiguru said. The most recent fire broke out on Friday morning last week at businesses in Kagio town. The fire engine failed to show up forcing residents to fetch water from a nearby well, in a bucket brigade. It is suspected the fire started from a fish cooking stall and spread to one that contained chickens that died. “We called the fire response team in Kerugoya but they could not help as the fire engine is down with a mechanical problem,” a resident said. “It took a long time to battle the fire because all options were fruitless." Another said firemen in Murang'a were unable to help. On February 1, residents were forced to help put out a fire that destroyed a dormitory at Karia Boys in Kerugoya. Firemen did not show up for lack of a working fire engine. Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri promised the fire response system would be improved soon. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
