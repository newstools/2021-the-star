The late Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli was on Friday laid to rest at his Chato home. Suluhu in her tribute to Magufuli appealed to Tanzanians to draw closer to God and remain united as the latter would have wished. She said though Magufuli was gone, as the president, she will continue to implement the values that the CCM party has put in place. "Nina wahaidi kutekeleza ahadi zote zilizoko kwenye chama cha CCM sio tu kwa ajali ya watu wa Chato bali kaw niaba ya watanzania wote," she said. While quoting a biblical verse from Isiah 41, Suluhu said, "We are here to finally rest our hero and general. Let us draw closer to God and pray that he grants him a peaceful rest". "Magufuli was called and he answered to the call, we shall miss him but we shall strive to enhance his 'hapa kazi tu' legacy," she added. Suluhu asked all Tanzanians especially those in the public sector and the private sector to continue in unity and cooperation. Magufuli was buried a few minutes past 4.30 pm after heart-moving tributes at the Magufuli grounds. Magufuli was pronounced dead on March 17 after a 10-year battle with heart-related complications. In a function conducted by the Military, Magufuli's casket was laid after a guard of honour in the presence of President Samia Suluhu. After the Military parade, fighter jets displayed last respects before the 21-gun salute after the body was lowered in the grave.
