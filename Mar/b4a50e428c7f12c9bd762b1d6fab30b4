The President has called on local researchers and scientists to come up with  innovations that would help the country combat Covid-19. Speaking in Kitengela on Thursday during the official flaging off of Covid vaccines to the nine regional storage centres, Uhuru noted that the country will continue partnering with organizations in clinical trials to ensure quality and efficacy of vaccines. "We have been partnering with international partners in clinical trials and we will continue to partner with other organizations towards that. Hopefully our own scientists and researchers can also come up with something," President Uhuru said. The president however said he hopes that neighbouring countries come out to vaccinate their people. "I don't want to talk about how other countries have prepared to fight this virus. We have come together as AU to see how we will assist each other to fight this pandemic and we will continue that way," Uhuru said. This comes amid reports of a surge in Covid-19 cases in Tanzania. Uhuru also noted that only experts will advise on whether leaders will be vaccinated, adding that the vaccines the country received are not enough hence the plan to ensure healthcare workers are vaccinated first. Uhuru also cautioned Kenyans to stop peddling falsehoods on the Covid-19 vaccination exercise. Uhuru reiterated Government's commitment to ensure the success of the vaccination exercise and urged Kenyans to continue observing Covid-19 containment protocols.
