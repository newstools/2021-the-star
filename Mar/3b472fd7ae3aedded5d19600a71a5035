Four suspects have been arrested over procurement irregularities in a tender for electrification of public primary schools. Another four are being sought by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission over the same. The suspects are officials from two companies which illegally obtained contracts worth Sh103 million to install solar power in public schools across the country. According to a statement by EACC's CEO Twalib Mbarak, investigations revealed both companies did not participate in the tender prequalification yet got awarded contracts for the job. Nav World and Northpride Limited unlawfully secured Sh39,896,018 and Sh46,957,685 respectively; monies meant to keep Kenyan learners in schools. "Upon completion of investigations, EACC recommended that REA officials, the directors of Nav World and directors of Northpride Limited be charged for conspiracy to commit an offense of corruption," Mbarak said. All the eight suspects will also be charged with abuse of office as well as fraudulent acquisition of public property. This comes as the commission continues with investigations into corruption allegations over a Sh124 million tender for the supply of Covid-19 emergency response provisions at Kenya Medical Suppliers Authority.
