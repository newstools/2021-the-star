In the sleepy Arahuka village of Subukia Sub-County, Nakuru County, four young family members were laid to rest in a mass grave in an emotive ceremony on Wednesday evening. The young couple, Peter Miano Wahome, his wife, Susan Muthoni and their children, Susan Muthoni and their children Princeton Wahome, 2 and daughter, Evalyn Nyawira, 7, perished in a road crash on the morning of February 28. The accident occurred near Two Rivers Mall in Kiambu at about 3:00 am when the Toyota Passo they were travelling in collided head-on with another saloon car. The driver of the other vehicle is still admitted to a hospital in Nairobi City. The burial service was attended by thousands of people among them the area MP, Samuel Gachobe and Kabazi Ward Representative, Peter Mbae. The National and County governments were also represented. During the burial, family and friends described Wahome as a humble and visionary man who had great plans for his family. A friend, Gerald Njihia said the taxi driver who used to operate in Githurai 45 had saved up enough cash and built a house in Mwihoko in the Nairobi Metropolis. “I understand the family was to move in their new house the following day but they all perished before they all perished as they travelled back to their rented house,” he said. The family was travelling to their house from Subukia where he paid part of his wife’s dowry and it was not clear why they were moving beyond the curfew hours. Wahome’s father Wahome Gichuki said he had engaged in a lengthy conversation on the night before they travelled. He nostalgically remembers his young granddaughter stubbornly refused to travel back which her parents. “We had to persuade her to go with her parents with a promise that they would come back again soon,” he said. Wahome’s brothers described him as a very hardworking man who always inspired then to do great things.
