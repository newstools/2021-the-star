Residents of Kanjeru, Kiambu, are fearful and in shock after a sacred mugumo fig tree toppled. The tree is revered by the Kikuyu and other communities and its falling on Sunday night is considered a bad omen. It was discovered on Monday. Prayers are carried out at the tree, prayers for blessings on the community, prayers for rain to end drought and other prayers for protection. The ancient tree fell in Muthure location, Kabete subcounty. Some trees can live 100 years. "We do not know what sin our society has committed. Maybe it was a social, political or economic sin,” resident Kimani wa Kamau said. The fallen tree attracted many onlookers who discussed the toppling in low tones, many saying the tree was sending a message. Kimani said barely three weeks ago, one of the branches broke and fell, and then the whole tree fell. "We are now scared. The falling branch made Kikuyu 'kiama kia ma' elders conduct sacrifices to cleanse it or reveal its message to prevent it from harming society," he added. Elders said the sacrifices are meant to cleanse any sin that might have been committed in the area or any bad message the tree wanted to pass. Elder Waweru wa Njau said the tree made cracking, falling sounds and then rammed into the ground with a loud bang. "People were frightened by the sound it produced. We have never seen this in this area — a sacred tree falling," he added. Since Monday, people have been discussing the tree and and relating the falling to many events in the area. Elder Mbira wa Muroki said Kikuyu elders are planning a ceremony to cleans the area and the tree, so it can be removed. A goat is likely to be slaughtered and its blood smeared on the wood and the ground. The sacrifice is intended to cleanse any evil spirits and allow residents to remove the wood. "As of now, I can't tell you when, but it will be soon. We have started talks with Kikuyu elders' Kiama kia ma, the top organ and they will guide us."
