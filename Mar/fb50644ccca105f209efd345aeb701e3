Kenya Lionesses' Rugby World Cup qualifier match against Colombia slated for this Saturday has been postponed to a later date. Director of rugby at Kenya Rugby Union, Thomas Odundo, said with the Rugby World Cup being postponed from September this year to next year, the qualifier will be played later in the year. “World Rugby have instructed us to play the game at a later date in the course of the year and they will advise accordingly," noted Odundo. Odundo said the postponement gives the squad more time to prepare for the qualifiers. "I do believe this gives the squad additional time to train and be ready for the match against Colombia and other international fixtures if the Covid-19 situation would allow,” added Odundo. The winner of Kenya vs Colombia tie heads to the repechage, where they will meet with other qualifiers from Asia, Europe and Oceania. Odundo believes with the majority of the Sevens squad making the team, they stand to gain a lot of exposure. “A good number of our players are in the sevens set up and will form the backbone of the backline for the 15's team. They are playing in build-up tournaments ahead of the Olympics like the Madrid and Dubai Sevens, which will aid in their course for the match against Colombia,” he added Head coach Felix Oloo said despite the postponement, the team will be relishing the challenge of facing the South Americans. “We will be ready for them once the match comes and we hope to qualify for the repechage. The girls are training well and we want to create history by being the first team to qualify for the World Cup," added Oloo. Should the Lionesses qualify for the global extravaganza, they will face hosts and defending champions New Zealand, Australia and Wales. Kenya missed out on the automatic ticket to the World Cup after finishing second in the Africa qualifiers in Johannesburg in 2019 after beating Uganda and Madagascar but losing to the hosts in the final.
