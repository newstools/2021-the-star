Safaricom has unveiled the second edition of the ‘Browse Bila Waas’ campaign that will see customers enjoy free 500MB daily bonus data with every purchase of a personalized no-expiry data bundle. The campaign will see Safaricom customers enjoy more internet for less on Kenya’s best network. Both Prepay and PostPay customers can access their personalised data bundles on *544# under the option “0” – Special Data Deals. Upon purchase of the bundle, which is available every day until May 23, 2021, customers will instantly receive a bonus of 500MB data valid until midnight of the same day. “Safaricom exists to transform lives. By expanding our network coverage, giving our customers more data for less and availing affordable 4G devices, we seek to empower more Kenyans to tap into the opportunities that come with internet access,” CEO Peter Ndegwa said. Growing demand for data has seen Safaricom partner with Google to enable its customers to acquire quality 4G devices via flexible payment plans. Currently, the Neon Ray Pro, which is bundled with free WhatsApp for 3 months, is available at all Safaricom shops, Masoko.com and dealer outlets at a discounted price of Sh 3,999/- while stocks last. Customers can also acquire the device by making a deposit of Sh500 and paying Sh20 daily for the balance. Last month, Safaricom was ranked by umlaut as having the best network for data and calls across the country for the fourth year in a row. The mobile operator has been aggressively expanding its 4G coverage with a goal of having 100% of its network on 4G. In 2020, Safaricom rolled out more than 1,600 new sites, bringing its 4G reach to more than 92 per cent of the country’s population.
