The High Court on Thursday morning ruled that the Director of Criminal Investigations entrapped Cyprian Nyakundi in the Sh17.5 million extortion charge. Early last year, Nyakundi was charged with extortion relating to Sh17.5 million from Victoria Commercial Bank. Justice Antony Mrima has ruled that the evidence obtained by the DCI for the Nyakundi extortion case was done illegally and is therefore inadmissible before the court. Nyakundi alongside Emmanuel Nyamweya allegedly already received Sh1 million from a victim as a down payment before their arrest last year. The two had allegedly demanded the cash as a precondition for pulling down libellousÂ posts appearing on a website they own. The police said the money was recovered after a successful investigation on extortion, blackmail and false accusations will be used as an exhibit.
