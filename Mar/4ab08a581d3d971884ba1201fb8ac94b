Despite booking a quarter final slot in the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) women's Cup tournament over the weekend, retaining the league remains a priority for defending champions Vihiga Queens. Queens beat Division One side Nyuki Starlets 4-0  to advance to the last eight. Other teams that qualified include Wadadia, Bunyore Starlets, Kayole Starlets, Kisumu All Starlets, Ulinzi, Zetech Sparks and Gaspo Women. Bunyore were the only non-premier league team to book a ticket Queens' coach Alex Alumira acknowledged that juggling between the cup competition and the league is a tough assignment as he highlighted the difference between the two competitions. "It is a tall order to remain competitive on both fronts. It's good we have advanced in cup competition but our main focus as a team is to retain the league title. We have won the past three league trophies and the fourth unprecedented gong would mark a greater achievement for us as a club," said Alumira. "When it comes to cup competitions, teams have different approaches as compared to the league that is more tactical. "Some teams specialise in cup assignments and play a  physical game without a game plan. "It becomes hard to defeat these teams. We will wait to see opponents in the quarters. We can win the cup but that is not our sole focus,"said Alumira whose team leads Zone B standings with 19 points after seven matches. Queens' have only drawn once in the league, dropping just two points. They have opened a six-point gap against second placed Trans-Nzoia Falcons, who have 13. Alumira further pointed out that Queens will draw their past experience to help them retain the league title. He observed that they are absolutely under no pressure and will take it on a match by match basis. "We can borrow a leaf from our past performances which I believe will be vital as we remain on course for the fourth title. We've been in this situation before and we feel less pressure. For now, it's going to be one step at a time."
