Newcastle United manager Steve Bruce said he feared the worst after losing forwards Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin to injury in the 1-1 Premier League draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday. Newcastle went 1-0 up in the 52nd minute after losing Miguel Almiron to injury at halftime, but when Saint-Maximin and Emil Krafth limped off in the second half they were forced onto the back foot and Wolves equalised through Ruben Neves in the 73rd. Almiron hit a post in the first half before getting hurt and being replaced for the second half, while Saint-Maximin had a goal ruled out for offside before going off with what appeared to be a groin injury in the 63rd minute. “It’s too early (to tell), but for someone like ‘Miggy’ in particular, Almiron, for him to come off and be in the state he is in, we fear the worst,” an exasperated Bruce told Sky Sports. “The first half an hour until the (Almiron) injury, we were excellent. We created four opportunities and at this level you have to take them. “The injuries have disrupted us but we’ve had enough big chances to get a couple of goals, but unfortunately we didn’t take them,” he added. “We’re disappointed because we had the big chances ... we’ve had three wonderful chances and then one with Joelinton with 10 minutes to go. It’s the same story, if you create chances but don’t take them, in the Premier League you’ll get punished.” Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo declared himself happy with how his side had played, despite only getting a point. “I’m not looking too much at the result. I’m looking more at the performance... our expectations are high, we expect good things from the players,” he said. The draw left struggling Newcastle in 17th place, four points above the relegation zone, with Wolves staying 13th.
