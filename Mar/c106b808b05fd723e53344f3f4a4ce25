Pope Francis has condemned extremism in the name of religion on a historic visit to Iraq where he discussed the plight of the Christian minority. "Hostility, extremism and violence are not born of a religious heart," he told an inter-faith prayer service. "They are betrayals of religion." Iraq has been wracked by religious violence, both against minorities but between Shia and Sunni Muslims too. Pope Francis also visited one of Shia Islam's most powerful figures. Receiving the head of the Roman Catholic Church at his home in the holy city of Najaf, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said Christians should be able to live in peace and security like all other Iraqis. The meeting was seen as a highly symbolic moment in the Pope's visit, which is his first international trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic more than a year ago, and the first ever papal visit to Iraq. Covid-19 and security fears have made this his riskiest trip yet. The 84-year-old leader of the Catholic Church earlier told reporters that he had felt "duty-bound" to make the "emblematic" journey, which will see him visit several sites over four days in Iraq. What else did the Pope say? He delivered his message at the site of the ancient city of Ur, held to be the birthplace of the Prophet Abraham, who is revered in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. An inter-faith service brought together representatives of Iraq's religions, including Shia, Sunni, Christian and Yazidi clerics. "We believers cannot be silent when terrorism abuses religion," the Pope said. "Indeed, we are called unambiguously to dispel all misunderstandings. Let us not allow the light of heaven to be overshadowed by the clouds of hatred." He singled out the suffering of the Yazidi community which had "mourned the deaths of many men and witnessed thousands of women, girls and children kidnapped, sold as slaves, subjected to physical violence and forced conversions".
