A widower has sued Mater Hospital for detaining the body of his late wife over a Sh3. 5 million bill. Nyambuti Maina said despite paying half of the bill, the hospital has declined to release the body of Priskillah until the bill is cleared. "The respondent continues to unlawfully, illegally and improperly detain the remains of Priskillah Kemunto Oendo in order to emotionally depress, oppress and blackmail me or my family members for their commercial gain yet they cannot auction the cadaver or the remains of the deceased and recover their dues," he said in his affidavit. Maina's wife died on January 8, 2021 and left behind a bill of Sh7 million. She was admitted to the hospital on November 9, 2020 and taken to the High Dependency Unit immediately. Seven days later she was transferred to a normal ward. Since her death, the hospital has been charging a daily morgue fee of Sh1,600. He wants the court to intervene and order for release of the body for burial.
