Communications Authority has fined Homeboyz radio Sh1m and ordered that the show be off air for six months. Addressing the media on Sunday, director general Mercy Wanjau said the suspension is until the station shows compliance with statutory requirements. Wanjau also directed that all presenters in the station to undergo mandatory training. "They should undergo training on programming code by the authority, and training by the National Gender and Equality commission," she said. She directed that the station should publish a public apology on two newspapers with nationwide circulation. Homeboyz should also air the same apology on the station prime time starting today for the next five days. In her directives, Wanjau said the station should review it's editorial policy to align it with requirements of the law on gender and file the same with the Authority. "Directed the station to ensure its presenters are accredited by the Media Council of Kenya and file evidence of compliance with the Authority," she said. On Saturday night, Homeboyz Radio and its parent company, Radio Africa, terminated the service of Shaffie Weru, Joseph Munoru (DJ Mfalme) and Neville Muysa with immediate effect. The termination follows a comprehensive review of the comments made on the station on Thursday morning and their subsequent suspension from employment. "Our partners and listeners will not be surprised by this action to terminate their services as it is the right thing to do," Homeboyz Radio General Manager Somoina Kimonjino said in a statement. She added; "The comments of said erstwhile employees were neither authorized, approved nor cleared with the company nor was the subject discussed and or authorized by the companyâ€™s senior leadership. We are deeply disappointed in their conduct." On Friday, the three were suspended for two weeks in relation to comments they made that appeared to victim shame and justify sexual assault against women.
