Agnes Kavindu Muthama was on Tuesday sworn in as the senator for Machakos county. She replaces the late Boniface Kabaka who passed away last December and becomes the fourth elected woman senator since the enactment of the 2010 Constitution. Kavindu won the seat on a Wiper party ticket in a by-election held last Thursday. She beat UDA’s Urbanus Ngengele in the high-stake poll that was touted as a 2020 test run for Deputy President William Ruto and Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka. She garnered 104, 352 votes against Ngengele’s 19, 726 votes. Kalonzo witnessed Kavindu’s swearing ceremony from the speaker’s gallery. He was in the company of Transport CAS Wavinya Ndeti, Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe and East Africa Community secretary-general Peter Mathuki. Also present at the speaker's gallery were MPs Julius Mawathe (Embakasi South), Stephen Mule (Matungulu), Edith Nyeri (Kitui West), Joyce Kamene (Machakos Woman representative and Robert Mbui (National Assembly Deputy Minority leader). Kavindu took the oath in a brief ceremony presided over by Speaker Kenneth Lusaka who congratulated the new lawmaker on her election and welcomed her to the House. Kavindu was escorted to the house by Senators Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya) and Abshiro Halake (nominated-Kanu). Wetangula is a member of the ‘One Kenya’ alliance that brings together Kalonzo’s Wiper, Gideon Moi’s Kanu and Musalia Mudavadi’s ANC.
