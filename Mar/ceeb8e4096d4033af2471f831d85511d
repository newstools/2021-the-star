Benjamin Ojema and Richmond Baraza have joined the coaching team at Kenya Under-20 rugby team ahead of the Barthes Cup in June. Newly-appointed coach Curtis Olago said Ojema will be the skills coach and will deal with the backs while Baraza, who is one of the coaches at Menengai Oilers, will bring his expertise in scrummaging to the side. "They will add value to the team. Their knowledge and expertise will come in handy as we prepare for the championship," Olago said. Olago, also the KCB head coach, expressed his satisfaction with the abilities of the 43 players selected during last week's trials, which attracted 86 players from different Kenya Cup clubs. “ We have a good crop of players drawn from clubs and training is quite competitive. We hope to pick a formidable squad for the event in June,” he said. The team trains thrice a week on Wednesday, Fridays, and Sundays as the tactician strives  to impart a structure-based philosophy on the youngsters. “I want to impart a rugby philosophy which will be expansive rugby. It is what has served me well at KCB over the years and I am confident it will work well with his young side,”  Olago added. Kenya will host the Africa Under-20 Championships from June 25- July 4. Known by their moniker, Chipu, Kenya are the defending champions having won the title  in 2019 when they upset powerhouses Namibia 21-18 at the KCB Sports Club, Ruaraka. At the Junior World Rugby Trophy, they  finished sixth after beating hosts Brazil 26-24 but lost  to Uruguay (63-11), Japan (48-34) and Canada (52-13). The winner of the Africa Cup will represent the continent at the Junior World Rugby Trophy slated for September.
