Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo has blamed 'outside' forces which he says are undermining his leadership. Nyaribo said the current wrangles that have been witnessed at the assembly ever since he assumed power are a result of some politicians who were determined to disorient him in his new responsibility. "It is clear the MCAs are not alone in this. There are some forces behind all that we are witnessing and it is only a matter of time before I fully come on top of them all," Nyaribo said. The Governor gave an example of the most recent happening when the Executive and Assembly took a retreat to Mombasa for a weeklong bonding session but some of them ended up being swayed by people he said were his detractors. "We went to Coast for a bonding session but the same forces that have been undermining still prevailed there and took a section of the MCAs to a different place," Nyaribo said. The Governor said this after launching a rapid initiative of opening 300 kilometres of roads using the National Government's Mechanical Transfer Fund (MTF). He said every ward will benefit from 15 kilometres of roads whose construction will be ongoing for the next six months. The Governor said MCAs were becoming a big barrier to his bid to deliver development projects to the residents of the county. "Every other time you see your MCAs you should remind them that they need to work well with me or they will face your wrath in the ballot," Nyaribo said in Esise Ward in Borabu where he launched the construction.
