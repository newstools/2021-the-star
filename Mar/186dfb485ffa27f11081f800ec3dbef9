Homeboyz will set their sights on the national Sevens circuit in July despite giving the Kenya Cup a wide berth. Club chairman Mike Rabar said: "After pulling out of the Kenya Cup, our energies will now turn to the circuit where we hope to be competitive in the shorter version of the game.” The deejays have won the overall circuit twice — 2016 and 2018 — and finished joint second with Mwamba in 2019 behind winners KCB. Rabar noted that they lost a number of their core players during the transfer window but the remaining players will stay with the club for the circuit and remainder of the season. “Despite losing a couple of players, the depth in the squad is remarkable. We still have over 80 players turning up for training sessions which is a good indicator for us as we focus on the start of the Sevens circuit," noted Rabar. Rabar said safety and welfare is paramount in light of the Covid-19 pandemic hence the decision to skip the Kenya Cup. "We can't compromise the safety and welfare of our players and technical staff. We will continue to monitor the situation for the next couple of months to ensure that all Covid-19 protocols are followed by the time we start the Sevens circuit," he added. Meanwhile, Rabar assured the rugby fraternity that the club will not be disbanded, contrary to the rumour mills. “We will not disband the team. We are here to stay and to promote the game in the country but the safety and welfare of our players is key. Once we feel everything is back to normal then we will be back” noted Rabar Mwamba, Impala and Nondies will return to the Kenya Cup fray this weekend after skipping two matchdays.
