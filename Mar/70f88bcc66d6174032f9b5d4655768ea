ODM has asked Deputy President William Ruto to drop the hustler narrative following a dismal performance in by-elections last Thursday. Ruto-linked United Democratic Alliance fielded candidates in five out of six in the by-elections and narrowly won the London ward. ODM national chairman John Mbadi said the results show the majority of Kenyans have not been convinced to buy the hustler narrative. Mbadi said DP Ruto and his allies should come up with a different campaign agenda and avoid the hustler narrative. He spoke during a service at Nyahera SDA Church in Homa Bay town. “We knew the hustler narrative which DP Ruto is promoting belongs to a few people. Let him drop the agenda because he will fail terribly,” Mbadi said. The Suba South MP said UDA party is not as robust as Ruto and his allies claim. “If you can be defeated four against one then it means you need to strategise again,” Mbadi said. Mbadi expressed confidence that ODM will form an alliance with other like-minded parties and will win the 2022 elections. “ODM gave ANC a run for its money in Matungu. We gained despite losing the seat and we’re very sure we will reclaim it next year,” he said. The National Assembly minority leader told DP Ruto to stop the hustler narrative saying it does not auger well with the majority of Kenyans. “The large crowds that DP Ruto attracts in campaigns don’t translate to votes but probably other things like handouts,” Mbadi said.
