Nyamira county will have to wait a little longer to get a deputy governor following the filing of a case seeking to stop the process of nomination. Patrick Atambo who is a voter has moved to court challenging the second nomination of deputy governor saying the law does not allow it. Governor Amos Nyaribo had nominated Dr James Ondicho on January 6 but his choice was rejected by the county assembly. And now Atambo says he is apprehensive the governor will go ahead and nominate a candidate a second time even though the law doesn't allow it. He wants the court to stop the governor from nominating another candidate. Section 32 (D) of the County Government Act only envisages approval of nominee and does not provide as to what happens if a nominee is rejected by the assembly. The office of the Deputy governor became vacant after Nyaribo assumed the office of governor in December 2020 when his boss died. John Nyagarama was elected as governor but he died on December 18.
