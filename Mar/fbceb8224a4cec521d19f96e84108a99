Property worth unknown value has been gutted in an evening inferno in Umoja's Tena Estate. The fire that started at around 6.30pm, has left several residential buildings, business stalls, clubs and private homes destroyed. Though the cause of the fire has not been established, eye witnesses say a gas cylinder exploded in one of the apartments before it spread out to other houses. Many of the residents due to the magnitude of the fire could not salvage their property but stood helpless as they watched the fire consume everything. Fire fighters led by the NMS teams are currently working hard to put off the fire.
