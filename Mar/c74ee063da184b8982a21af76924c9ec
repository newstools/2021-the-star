Media personality Betty Kyallo says she is nowhere near to getting married. In an interview with Mwende, the mother of one said she still has a lot of things to achieve before settling down with a man. "Mi nakaa kuwa wife material? Hiyo maneno ilinishinda kabisa, acha ningangane kiviangu. I canâ€™t be a housewife and just sit there. I also have things I want to achieve." Betty was also expected to feature in Eric Omondi's 'Wife Material' but said she was unable to keep up with the energy the girls in the show had. "Eric is my friend and I watched the show, but do you see how those girls dance? I do not know how to twerk. I also have a job to go to, a kid to take care of, so acha ningangane kiviangu."
