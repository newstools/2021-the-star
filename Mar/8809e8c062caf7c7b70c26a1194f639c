Kenyans started being vaccinated yesterday. Hallelujah! The end of the Covid-19 era is in sight. Some misguided people are sowing doubts about the safety of the vaccine. Some Catholic priests in Kenya question it although Pope Francis himself was publicly vaccinated against Covid. Some governors doubted the vaccine, probably for political reasons, but more sensible leaders, like Granton Samboja of Taita Taveta, have publicly committed to being vaccinated. The truth is that it is far, far safer to be vaccinated than not to be vaccinated. It would be a mistake not to get vaccinated. Deadly diseases like smallpox, polio, yellow fever and measles have been eradicated by mass vaccination. Do you want to catch one of those diseases? In the UK, over 21 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, mostly AstraZeneca which is the vaccine for Kenya. A few people reported soreness in the injection area but there have been no serious side-effects. Covid has killed 1,900 Kenyans and sickened over 110,000 Kenyans. So why take the risk? The AstraZeneca vaccine is safe, Covid-19 is dangerous. If you are offered the vaccine, seize the opportunity to get protected.
