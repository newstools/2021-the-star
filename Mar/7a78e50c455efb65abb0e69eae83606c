Investigating officers have requested five days to finalize the case file against a suspected owner of seized bhang worth Sh13 million. The suspect was presented at the Kamiti law courts in Nairobi on Thursday morning after his drug consignment was seized on Wednesday in the Arapal area of Marsabit county. The narcotics were destined for Nairobi when a multi-agency team managed to intercept a water boozer that had it. The consignment of drugs was concealed within a water bowser. Upon realising that he was cornered, the driver of the lorry jumped and escaped during the operation. The suspected owner of the consignment was later arrested in Nairobi’s Githurai area as a team from Transnational Organized Crime Unit (TOCU) launched a manhunt for the driver of the vehicle. It has been decided that the cannabis be offloaded and weighed in Marsabit before being transferred to Nairobi for further investigations. This comes days after police seized 191 rolls of bhang worth Sh65, 000 in Kwale county. Most of the bhang seized in the region originates in Ethiopia.
