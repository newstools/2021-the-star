@robertomollo3 A 35-year-old man was lynched by irate members of the public after robbing a trader of Sh10,000 in Ndhiwa. Samson Odoyo was stoned on Saturday at Aorachuodho market in Katora village, West Kwabwai. Residents said he waylaid the woman on her way from the market, attacked her and grabbed her purse. She screamed, prompting residents to come to her rescue. Odoyo fled but was pursued and nabbed. The mob took the purse and the money and handed them back to the woman, then beat up Odoyo, leaving him for dead. An eyewitness said Odoyo had grabbed the woman by her neck and tried to strangle her. “The man ran away with the purse with the money after wrestling the woman to the ground. Angry residents caught up with him and lynched him,” a resident said. Ndhiwa subcounty police commander Robert Aboki said the incident occurred around 7:30pm. “Odoyo remained unconscious after he was beaten. He succumbed to his injuries on arrival to a hospital in Ndhiwa town,” he said. Aboki appealed to residents to avoid taking law into their own hands. He said members of the public should have handed him over to the police for further action. “The angry mob instead of bringing the suspect to the police decided to descend on him with crude weapons and left him to die,” Aboki said. The woman was called to record a statement at Ndhiwa police station, while his attacker's body was taken to Manyatta Kobodo Mortuary.
