Former Vihiga chief of staff Noah Okaya will challenge Luanda MP Christopher Omulele in the 2022 General Election. Okaya announced this while addressing mourners at Ibubi area in Luanda sub-county on Saturday. He has not hinted which political party he will use. Previously, Okaya had dismissed as false claims that he is eyeing the Luanda parliamentary seat in 2022. “I'm not a politician, neither am I planning to be, that is not part of plans,” he said. “I'm beyond politics, therefore there is no need for people to have restless nights with me,” he said. Okaya had said Luanda has strong politicians who can battle the incumbent MP. Reports indicate that Okaya is being fronted to battle incumbent MP Chris Omulele and to stabilise the ground for Governor Wilber Ottichilo, who has been meeting opposing forces within the Luanda constituency. He opposed that statement saying those who are spreading the rumours as misleading. “I'm a principled man with sober minds to make my own decisions keenly on my assessments on the ground,” he said. Arthur Apungu (ANC), Albert Obbuyi (Ford Kenya), and Dishon Atemo (UDF) are some of the senior politicians in the area who unsuccessfully battled to unseat Omulele 2017. Omulele was elected in 2013 on ODM ticket as the first Luanda MP under the current Constitution and is currently serving his second term. The lawmaker also sits on the speaker’s panel in the national assembly.
