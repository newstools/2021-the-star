Former Tahidi High actress Angel Waruinge, aka Miss Morgan, recently opened up about battling depression. Speaking in a YouTube interview with Hiram Maina, she said she resorted to alcohol when things did not go according to plan. Waruinge is known for playing the strict deputy principal of Tahidi High, Miss Morgan. She said she faced numerous challenges after the show ended, including living beyond her means. "I basically went through it. What happens when you start becoming famous, you start living this life, you start becoming broke, but you still have to live to that expectation. Then you start living an empty life," Waruinge explained. The actress says she fell into a mental and identity crisis. It was then that depression set in and she sought solace in alcohol. "So, when you start living an empty life, what happens? You start getting stressed… I went through depression. And depression can take you to alcohol. Some other people will just hide in the Christian faith. I embraced alcoholism at some point but luckily I had a strong family and friends who noticed what was happening to me," she said. During this period, she gained weight and started losing her self-esteem. "When I was down there, I was trying to lose weight. When I lost myself, I started losing self-esteem. You’re getting broke because you’re mismanaging your finances. I knew I could get out, but I didn’t know how." Eventually she gave herself time to heal by changing her environment and moving out of her place. She also spoke about her love life. "I am a single mum to an eight-year-old girl. When I look at my life she is the only thing I did right. If she was not there, we would be talking of a different story. I feel blessed having her in my life." Her former co-stars in Tahidi High Omosh and Dennis Mugo, aka OJ, have also spoken of their low moments after the show ended.
