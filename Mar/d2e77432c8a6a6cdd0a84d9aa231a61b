Busia Woman Representative Florence Mutua has questioned former Funyula MP Paul Otuoma's return to ODM party, terming it not genuine. Otuoma ditched ODM in 2017 and vied for Busia governorship as an independent candidate. He has also been seen as friendly to Deputy President William Ruto. Mutua said if he is sincere he is returning to the party, Otuoma must follow the party regulations so he can be welcomed back formally. “I will personally direct Otuoma to the right ODM offices so that he can officially come back to the party and wait to be given the right direction on the next move,” Mutua said. The woman rep was addressing ODM delegates in Busia on Sunday. ODM party leader Raila Odinga and Busia chairman Geoffrey Odanga were present at the meeting. Otuoma regretted being out of the party but confirmed he is back after walking alone for awhile. He said he had learnt his lessons while outside the party, hence opted to come back. Mutua said Otuoma will have to convince the party officials that he will not ditch the party again at the point of need. The woman rep is gunning for the Busia governorship in 2022 and will battle it out with Otuoma for the ODM ticket should he be allowed back by the party organs.
