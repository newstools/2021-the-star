A woman from Nairobi's Kawangware slum on Thursday caused a stir during the BBI public participation forum in Parliament. After making a passionate case for BBI and the Handshake, Beatrice Wayeko, calling herself Mama Njugu, invited the members to buy her groundnuts, saying she can now sell her merchandise in peace following the pact between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. "We have suffered every election. We cannot but anything. Today, we are free. Our children can walk and I can sell njugu to everybody," she said. Wayeko was among the presenters who made their submissions under the Nairobi Mashinani Women Caucus to the joint Justice and Legal Affairs Committees of Parliament. Soon after her submission, Wayeko walked over to Senator Johnson Sakaja where the lawmaker bought the groundnuts. "Just for your information, I want to inform members that I have your groundnuts here," Sakaja said. Wayeko said the with the BBI proposals, many slum children will get more bursaries unlike now when they get between Sh2,000 and Sh5,000. The women caucus was led by its chairperson Rachel Kamweru. They said there will be enough bursaries for their children with an increase if CDF allocation and additional 12 constituencies that will pump in Sh1.2 billion in the capital.
