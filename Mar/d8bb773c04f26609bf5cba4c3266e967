KCB Bank has been recognized as the best bank in Kenya by the respected Global Finance Magazine during their 28th annual awards for the World’s Best Banks.  KCB Bank has won this award, for the third year in a row. This recognition was awarded to the bank for its robust market presence in the East African region, and its digital innovation to drive financial inclusion especially during a pandemic. KCB Group CEO and MD Joshua Oigara said they are delighted to receive the award for the third year in a row. "With such recognition, we are constantly motivated to continue putting in the effort to ensure we can serve our customers to the best of our abilities," he said. In a statement by Global Finance, Joseph D. Giarraputo, publisher and editorial director of Global Finance said banks are playing a key role in economic recovery around the world. "Our Best Bank awards highlight the leaders in restoring growth and mapping a way forward. This year’s evaluations are more important and valuable than at any point in their 28-year history, given the unprecedented economic conditions wrought by the global pandemic," he said. The award selections were made by the editors of Global Finance after extensive consultations with corporate financial executives, bankers and banking consultants, and analysts throughout the world. The award comes just days after KCB Group released their 2020 full-year financial results where they reported a net profit of Sh.19.6 billion for the full year ending December 2020. In February, the Bank was recognized by the Middle East & Africa Innovations Awards 2021 (The Digital Banker) for the Best ESG Award.
