DP William Ruto has dismissed claims the newly formulated UDA party is losing ground. Speaking during an interview with Kiss FM presenter Felix Oduor, Ruto said the party is a national party that is gaining momentum. He claimed that UDA has more support base that ANC, Wiper and Ford Kenya. "UDA cannot be compared to some village parties like ANC and Ford Kenya, we are a national movement,"  he said. While dismissing claims that UDA suffered a big loss in the just concluded by-election in Machakos, Kabuchai and Matungu, Ruto said UDA is not fielding candidates just to win but consolidate its support base. " Ford-K cannot win an election beyond Kabuchai and ANC is a party tied to Kakamega, so how do you compare some village entities with a party that is of national representation,"  Ruto said. The DP said the leadership of the two parties does not think outside their constituencies yet they want to become national leaders. "At UDA, we don't field candidates merely because we expect to win but because we want that support base." The deputy president refuted claims that some MPs were leaving the party out of fear. Kimilili's Didmus Barasa has said he would take a break from UDA. "Unajua hii siasa ni kama jikoni mahali kuna joto, jasho na moshi. Na usipo vumilia hio mambo yote , chakula hakiwezi kuiva. Mimi nimevumilia na hiki chakula lazima itaiva,"  Ruto said. (Politics is like a kitchen with smoke, heat and sweat. If you don't persevere, you cannot cook food. For me, I have endured all that and the food will be ready soon). While drumming support for his hustler movement, Ruto said his main agenda is to rally Kenyans to appreciate the fact that every hustle matters. "There is no job that is better than the other and as Kenyans, we must learn to embrace the little that we have to put food on the table. We must appreciate living with anything under any situation,"  he said.
