ODM party leader Raila Odinga is in good spirits and will address Kenyans soon, his neurosurgeon David Oluoch-OLunya has said. In a medical report on Wednesday, Oluoch said that Raila walked in for routine medical tests on March 9 at the Nairobi Hospital after feeling fatigued. "He has had a rigorous campaign and needed to have some check ups. This was carried out successfully," Oluoch-OLunya said. Oluoch-OLunya said Raila is still undergoing some further investigations with a team of doctors and has been advised to take a rest. "We are continuing to monitor his condition and no doubt he will be able to address the country in due course," he added. Raila reportedly complained of fatigue when he returned from a grueling five-day tour of the Coast region where he had drummed up support for the Building Bridges Initiative “He checked in for a complete series of tests because he has been on a countrywide tour from Turkana to Narok to Busia and Coast region without rest. The doctors have advised that he takes complete rest as they continue to run tests,” his spokesman Dennis Onyango said. Onyango added that Raila was also due for his annual check-up conducted every March. On Tuesday evening, doctors were waiting for his liver test results and were yet to decide whether to release Raila or put him on bed rest.
