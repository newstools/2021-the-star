Learning was on Monday paralyzed at Riruta Primary School in Dagoretti, Nairobi after a fire broke out on Sunday evening. Seven classrooms, desks and pupils’ valuables were destroyed in the fire incident that took several hours to be put out. The school’s headteacher Agnes Muchiri blamed it on an electric fault. She said all the 2,000 pupils are safe but the school has been forced to squeeze them in other classrooms that were not affected. Muchiri said about 300 desks were destroyed in the inferno and that the pupils are now sharing desks until they find an alternative solution. She urged the county government to intervene and assist them in getting other desks and re-constructing the razed classrooms. School officials say the fire began at around 3 pm and went on until midnight. The razed block accommodated Classes 5 and 7.
