A Nairobi court has allowed a pastor to adopt a child who was abandoned four years ago at a railway line in the Dandora slums. The pastor, whose husband died nine years ago, has a 32-year-old son who has consented to his mother adopting the orphan. Justice Maureen Odero said on March 5 the pastor who runs a church in Nairobi, had assured the court that her son and extended family were supportive of the adoption. The judge said the pastor's son had informed the court he was aware that adoption of the child will mean he will be entitled to all rights due to a biological child, including the right to inheritance. The court ruled that since efforts for years to trace the relatives of the child have been futile, the need for parental consent to adopt will be waived. "Instead of the child spending years of uncertainty at the children's home, it's only right that the adoption is allowed," the court ruled. Judge Odero said the adoption will grant the child the opportunity to be raised in a safe and loving Christian home. The judge said she had interviewed the child online and he was able to state his name and kindergarten school. "Evidence of the child's bonding with the family was clear to me as he sat comfortably on the lap of the applicant's adult son. He was cheerful and appeared well taken care of," the court said. According to court records, the child is believed to have been abandoned in August 2016 shortly after birth in Dandora. He was rescued by a good Samaritan and later taken to a children's home. The child was placed into foster care with the pastor who took him in last year and applied for adoption. The judge ruled, "From the evidence produced in court, I am satisfied that the applicant is a suitable adoptive parent." (Edited by V. Graham)
