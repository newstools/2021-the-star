Point-less Eldoret Falcons hope to improve on their performance when they host high-flying Trans Nzoia Falcons in the second round of Kenya Women Premier Lleague at the Eldoret ASK Showground on Saturday. Eldoret Falcons, who currently sit bottom of Zone B table, lost 2-0 in the opening fixture at the Kenyatta Stadium in Kitale. Club's chairman Joshua Ariko said it is time to redeem their image despite sluggish preparations due to financial constraints. “We want to play good football to earn points but our preps are hampered by lack of finances. As much as we want to play our best, we have no muscles to match our opponents in the league,” claimed Ariko. He said they want to ensure they play better in the second round starting this weekend against  Trans Nzoia  after mediocre performance in the first round. Eldoret lost to Division Two side, Nyuki Starlets at home while Trans Nzoia succumbed to Vihiga Queens in the Football Kenya Federation Women’s Cup. “We lost the opening fixture but we  are determined to get  maximum points against them at our home ground,” stated Ariko.
