The IEBC and the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics are engrossed in a bitter fight that has frustrated the tabulation of electoral population data barely 16 months to the 2022 General Elections. KNBS has accused the electoral agency of frustrating the process of validation of electoral population data. Director-General George Obudho said the commission has declined to release shapefiles - digital maps of the wards and constituencies to enable it to validate its data. "We have data up to constituency level what is lacking is validation. We have had several meetings and correspondences requesting shapefiles but the commission has not released this data," Obudho said. The fight could frustrate the delimitation of the constituency boundaries and even the upcoming polls. Chebukati, who was present during Obudho's submission, admitted that the commission has not released the digital files. The chairman said that doing so would amount to ceding their mandate to KNBS. "It is like we are being told let the delimitation of constituencies done by KNBS. We have provided hard copies of but not the shapefiles. Doing so will amount to ceding our mandate to other agencies," he said. Obudho and Chebukati on Wednesday appeared before the joint Justice and Legal Affairs Committees during the public hearing on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020. The IEBC boss at the same time defended the commission for the delays in beginning the process of delimitation of the boundaries. He said that while the commission was ready, there were delays to get funds from the Treasury and data from KNBS and they had already developed a boundary review plan. He however said they have received some funds in the current financial year and is currently putting in place infrastructure in readiness for the boundary review.
