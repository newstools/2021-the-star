Mugithi singer Samidoh has broken his silence one month after he publicly apologised to his wife Edith for having an affair and siring a child with politician Karen Nyamu. Through his new song, 'Ihinda Ringi' [Another chance], he pleads with God to protect him from all his enemies and to never allow him to be a slave of his mistakes. In the first stanza of the song, he thanked God for blessing him with talent but regrets that it becomes his downfall. "Please let my relationship with you be permanent and even when I make stupid decisions, kindly forgive me. Give me another chance. I prayed that you expand my territories and you gave me a favour, now they know me all over." He added that enemies are all over and were it not for the prayers from those who love him, he would have been finished. "Give me another chance and hide my star from my enemies. My talent is to build rather than destroy them. I am human and at times I will fall into temptations." In a long social media post early this month, the father of three admitted to having an affair with Nyamu that yielded a son. While saying he put his family in a bad situation, he affirmed that he would fully support Nyamu's son emotionally and materially. "I bless my generation and may it continue growing. I now apologise to you my fans for setting a bad example. I take full responsibility for my mistakes, which I regret. We have had our own shares of ups and downs but we are stronger and happy together," he said.
