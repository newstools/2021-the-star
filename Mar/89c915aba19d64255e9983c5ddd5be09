Most counties used the  Covid-19 cash from donors and the National Treasury to pay allowances for health workers instead of spending it on drugs, patients and PPE. In Kisumu, for instance, allowances paid to the health personnel who were working at the Covid-19 Unit were Sh68 million of the Sh276 million spent by the lakeside county on other Covid-19-related expenses. According to the latest report by the Controller of Budget that analysed how money for the first half of the 2020-21 budget was used, Kisumu used Sh8.4 million to hire toilets and tents at a time when public gatherings and meetings had been outlawed by the county government. The county further spent Sh26 million on daily subsistence allowances and Sh6.8 million on catering services. Governor Anyang' Nyong'o's administration also used Sh1.8 million to procure consultancy services and another Sh3.3  million on communication. In Makueni, where Sh91 million was spent on Covid-19-related matters,  health staff took Sh58 million and personal protective gear acquired was worth Sh15 million, according to the report. In Nandi , out of Sh224 million spent on Covid-19 response, health personnel pocketed Sh 77 million in allowances. The county spent Sh114 million on beds and medical equipment. In Migori, Sh201 million was spent on Covid-19 out of which Sh44 went to pay allowances for the health workers. The county also spent Sh39.6 million on bedding and linen, Sh24 million was spent on domestic travel and accommodation, while medicines accounted for only Sh4 million. In Homa Bay, Sh146 million was spent on Covid-19, with Sh20.5 million going towards the purchase of sanitiser, masks and thermo guns. The county used Sh150 million to put up an isolation unit and intensive care units, while staff at the Covid-19 units took away Sh7.6 million in allowances. Governor Cyprian Awiti's administration bought PPE worth Sh5.8 million, and spent Sh4 million on hotel, fuel, printing and publication expenses. In Narok, the county government paid allowances worth Sh34 million to its health workers and bought PPE worth Sh9 million. Even more puzzling from the report is the amount that was used by MCAs and members of the county executive committees to fund  travel within and outside the  country when movement was restricted. Although most county assemblies had suspended sittings and asked members to operate from home to reduce physical interaction as away to curb Covid-19, they still reported having spent millions in committee sittings. In Homa Bay, for example, the county assembly spent Sh63 million to finance committee sittings for its 61 MCAs and the speaker against its annual allocation of Sh117 million. Each MCA was paid a monthly allowance of Sh172 ,295 against the SRC's recommended ceiling of Sh124,800 a month. During the same period, the MCAs spent Sh73 million to travel within the country while the executive spent Sh32.4 million. In Kisumu, MCAs spent Sh41 million on committee sittings, with each of them pocketing an average of Sh139,688 a month, which was above the SRC ceiling of Sh124,800. Both the executive and the assembly spent Sh79.1 million on domestic travel,  with the assembly taking the largest share of  Sh41 million. The executive further spent Sh3.6 million on foreign trips. In Migori, MCAs used Sh67 million to travel locally, while the executive spent Sh194 million. The ward representatives further used Sh5 .4 million to travel abroad. In Siaya, the assembly spent Sh27 million to fund committee sittings for its 42 MCAs out of the Sh48 million they had allocated, with each MCA taking home an average of Sh105,417 a month. The county assembly used Sh49 million on local trips, while the executive spent Sh162 million on the same. According to the CoB, most of these counties witnessed  low absorption  of development funds. They also failed to raise their own revenue targets that would have enabled them to  finance their obligations. Many had bloated wage bills against county government regulations that limit the expenditure on wages and benefits at 35 per cent. For instance, Homa Bay county had spent Sh1.79 billion on salaries. According to the CoB, this was 60.4 per cent of the total expenditure and 56.3 per cent of the available revenue—Sh3.17 billion. During the first half of the 2020-21 financial year, Homa Bay had generated Sh33 million as own source revenue. This represented a decrease of 33.1 per cent compared to Sh49.35 million raised during a similar period in 2019-20. The county spent Sh745 million on development projects, while recurrent took Sh2.21 billion.
