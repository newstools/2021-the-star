Diamond Platnumz has brought together 12 male Tanzanian artistes to celebrate women in a song called 'Super Woman'. "This song goes out to all the Super Women Out there," he wrote on Instagram. In another post, he wrote, "Mwanamke ni Mama, Mwanamke ni Kiongozi, Mwanamke ni Mwalimu. Mwanamke ni Amani. Mwanamke ni Upendo (A woman is a mother, a leader, a teacher, peace and love)." The song came out just days before International Women's Day, which was held yesterday. Apart from the self-proclaimed Rolls Royce musician from Africa, the song featured Rayvanny, Mbosso, Lava Lava, Juma Jux, Belle, Marioo, Madee, Baba Levo, GNako, Joel Lwaga and Dulla Makabila.
