The Ondiri Swamp in Kiambu will be gazetted to protect it from pollution, Environment CS Keriako Tobiko said on Wednesday. He said the swamp is an important source of water for the people around it and the government is keen on protecting it. Tobiko spoke during a virtual meeting with the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Lands to deliberate on a petition concerning the gazettement of Ondiri Wetlands. The CS said Ondiri Wetlands will be fenced to curb encroachment and activities that lead to land degradation. "Measures have been put in place to stop industries, horticultural farms, and farming activities along the swamp." The CS said the ministry is seeking to restore the swamp by calling for the cancellation of title deeds of individuals who had encroached on the wetlands and  planting bamboo trees. Tobiko said discharge of both solid and liquid waste has been stopped. He said it was imperative that issues of Ondiri Swamp and the Nairobi River be deliberated conclusively among all relevant ministries, departments and agencies to protect and conserve them. Tobiko was flanked by National Environment Management Authority director general Mamo Mamo, National Environmental Complaints Committee director John Chumo, and secretary administration Joel Kitili. On January 5, Mamo told the Star that the process to protect the swamp is at an advanced stage. "We will gazette the swamp soon," Mamo said. Conservationists who have been pushing the government to gazette the swamp with a view to restoring its lost glory welcomed Nema's move. Mazingira Yetu director Sam Dindi said a nature trail will be established on the wetland and young people will be trained on birding.
