Google Arts and Culture has documented achievements made by revered Kenyan heroines in the fight for freedom against colonial rule. Among those recognised are Cierume, the dancing warrior from the Mbeere community. She is remembered for fearlessly fighting for her people's rights from the British colonialists. Mekatilili wa Menza raised awareness for women's rights and joined calls to resist British rule. She is also said to have had mysterious powers that came from the Kaya, the Giriama shrines. Others are women builders of Mana, Syokimau 'The Oracle' and Moraa wa Ng’iti, who was a magical warrior among the Kisii community. Just like this year’s theme for International Women’s Day, ‘Choose to Challenge’, the stories of these heroines are an inspiration to the current and future generations to speak up, question and call out inequality, bias and stereotyping.
