With this market expansion, we’ve recently taken a number of decisions to strengthen our focus on three strategic pillars of people, data, and technology in order to help our clients grow their businesses.” In its first year, GroupM Academy’s 11 graduates have been absorbed internally at Groupm and the intention is to position future available graduates to clients and affiliate partners in the region.
