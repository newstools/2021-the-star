Gor Mahia coach Manuel Vaz Pinto is keen on giving young players from the Youth Team a chance to showcase their worth when the national champions face Congo Boys in a Cup fixture in Mombasa on Sunday. Vaz Pinto maintained on the club website that the young players will be filling up the gap left by injured players and four senior players who are engaged in national duties — Kenneth Muguna, Cliffton Miheso, Tito OKello and Jules Ulimwengu. “In the next few days we will call upon players from our Youth Team in order to make up for the spaces left by four senior players who will be with national teams and the injured players as we prepare for the Cup match,” Pinto noted. Commenting on the 3-1 win against Bidco United on Monday, Pinto said: “My players were committed, intense and played one of the best games… Despite the initial disadvantage, we were able to turn the result around with quality in the game — always stronger than the opponent and an entirely fair victory for Gor Mahia.” Gor are way off the pace in their bid for a record-extending fifth successive league title and winning the Betway FKF Cup is their most realistic avenue of playing continental football next year.
