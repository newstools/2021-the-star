Two brothers in Kisumu have been arrested following a gruesome murder of a 68-year-old man. The two suspectsÂ  Caleb Ojoro and his brother Festus Ombogo were arrested on Sunday evening and taken to Maseno police station. Kisumu county police commander Samuel Anampiu said the duo is suspected to have accosted Jared Oringo- the deceased as he was clearing a piece of land at a village in Newa sub-location within Kisumu West sub-county. The incident happened at 3 pm on Sunday. The deceased's wife Milka Atieno told the police probing the murder that an argument arose between her husband and the two brothers aged 26 and 18 years over a piece of land. " He was clearing the land and I was harvesting cassava when the two emerged, armed with a jembe. They demanded to know why my husband was clearing the land," she said. Following the disagreement, the young men reportedly snatched a panga from the deceased which they used to cut him on the shoulder. According to the police, the injured man fell down and his wife came to his rescue before she was also attacked by the brothers. " They cut off her fingers and also hit her on the back," Anampiu said. Neighbors who heard them screaming for help rushed to the scene and took the couple to Miringa sub-county hospital. The man succumbed to the injuries on arrival at the hospital but his wife was treated and discharged. Police later took his body to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary in Kisumu for autopsy. The duo is expected to be arraigned in court to face murder charges on Tuesday.
