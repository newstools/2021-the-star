Nairobi City Stars will miss the services of dependable midfielder Peter 'Pinchez' Opiyo when they take on log leaders Tusker next Saturday at Kasarani. Opiyo, who is City Stars' top scorer this season with four goals, was slapped with a fifth yellow card this season in the last game against AFC Leopards. The card was earned in the 61st minute after a challenge on a Leopards player deep in the City Stars territory. “That card really disturbed me. I didn’t expect to get one but hey, that’s the nature of the game. You have to be prepared to miss some matches,” Opiyo told the club’s website. City Stars head coach Sanjin Alagic said Opiyo’s absence is a big blow but there is no choice but to dive into the brewers game without his midfield lynchpin. “The absence of Pinchez in the match against league leaders Tusker is a big blow for us because he’s such an important player in our team. When you play against the best teams in the league, you definitely need all your best players in the squad,” said the Uefa Pro License holder. The Bosnian added: “But I don’t want to whine about that. We will try to prepare ourselves in the best way possible and try to get ready for the match to achieve a positive result.” So far, 'Pinchez' had clocked the full 90 minutes in all the 15 games into the season and he emerged as City Stars' most valuable Player in four games against Wazito, KCB, Ulinzi Stars, and Kakamega Homeboyz. He scored in three straight games against Wazito, Posta Rangers, and Ulinzi Stars in January, then added a fourth against Western Stima in March. Tusker leads the log with 35 points while City Stars popularly known as 'Simba wa Nairobi' lie 9th on the table with 19 points
