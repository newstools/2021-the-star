Kenya Commercial Bank  recovered from one set down to beat Kenya Pipeline 3-1 in a women's Kenya Volleyball Federation League match at Nyayo Stadium on Sunday afternoon. The bankers lost the first set 23-25 before powering back to overwhelm the Oilers 25-21 in the second set. They won the third and fourth sets 25-19 and 25-17 respectively, a result that excited coach Japheth Munala. “After losing the first set, we had to get our act together and play as a team and the result is thoroughly deserved. The presence of national team coach and KCB technical director Paul Bitok brought confusion to the Pipeline playing unit,"Munala said. He believes there is more to come from his side as they find their rhythm. "We will embark on thorough training ahead of the third leg later next month,” he said. His Pipeline counterpart Paul Gitau was equally impressed by his young team despite losing and tipped the budding players to make a mark going forward. “We won the first set but we could not build on that. I am building a team for the future and there is  a lot of work to be done to get the young players to a competitive level. The result gives us hope the team is in the right direction,” Gitau said. Elsewhere,  Kenya Prisons women’s team picked up from where they left in the first leg with a 3-0 hammering of Nairobi Prisons. Straight sets of 25-15, 25-15, 25-16 were enough for the Josp Barasa -coached side to inflict more misery on their counterparts, who had lost their previous two matches. Nairobi Prisons are making their maiden appearance in the KVF league and are finding the going tough.  Kenya Prisons have registered nine points from three matches. In another league match, Directorate of Criminal Investigations, DCI, mauled Nairobi Water 3-1 in sets of 25-20, 25-20, 21-25 and 25-13. In the men’s category,  Kenya Prisons got the better of Kenya Ports Authority KPA in a five-set thriller of 24-26, 25-19, 20-25, 25-23,15-12.
