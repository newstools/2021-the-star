Kenya Police head coach Francis Mwangi said the signing of four players will boost the team’s chances of securing promotion to the Kenyan Premier League. The new signings are strikers Kevin Omondi from Tusker and Seif Puzzo from Shabana, defender Kevin Gazza from Mathare United and midfielder Samson Ndegwa from Mt Kenya United. “My target is to lead Kenya Police to the Kenyan Premier League. The league is tough but I’m confident that we shall make it. We only signed four players because we didn’t want to destabilize the team,” he told the Star on phone. “So far, I’m happy with the boys but we are not going to rest on our laurels because all the 20 teams have a target of playing in the KPL.” Despite being held to a barren draw by struggling Muranga Seal, the law enforcers maintained their place on top of the National Super League with 29 points, three ahead of Ken Kenyatta-coached Talanta, who beat Nairobi Stima 3-1 on Sunday. Barrack Odhiambo scored twice while Francis Kahiro added the third. John Njoroge pulled one back for Nairobi Stima. Fortune Sacco moved to third on the standings with 22 points after a 1-0 win over Shabana at Awendo Green Stadium. Robert Mutua scored the all-important goal for the visitors to condemn Shabana to their fourth defeat of the season. Mt Kenya United beat Coast Stima 2-1 to record their first win of the season. Victor Ochieng and Kevin Ndungu were on target for the former Kenyan Premier League side while Clinton Ochieng scored Coast Stima’s consolation. Kisumu Hot Stars returned to winning ways after a hard-fought 1-0 victory over newcomers Soy United while Kibera Black Stars edged Silibwet 3-2 in a five-goal thriller.
