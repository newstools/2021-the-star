The body of a woman who went missing on Monday in Kinangop Nyandarua county has been found in an underground tank. It’s suspected that the mother of two slipped and fell into the tank that was half-filled leading to her death. Emotions ran high in Magumu village as police moved in to collect the body before taking it to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem. Samuel Kuria, a resident, said the woman disappeared on Monday evening and efforts to trace her bore no fruit. He said they reported the matter to Magumu police station where a search was mounted leading to the recovery of the body in the tank. “We suspect that she slipped and fell into the underground tank where the body was recovered in the morning by members of the public and police,” he said. Meanwhile, police in Naivasha are investigating an incident in which the body of a  man was found dumped along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The unidentified body was found near Karai trading centre, with contradicting information emerging over the cause of the death. Police indicated that the deceased died from illicit brew consumption, but residents alleged that the man was killed elsewhere and dumped at the scene. Peter Mugo said the deceased was not known in the area, adding that they suspected foul play in the death. “There are no shops or bars around where the body was found and we suspect that he was murdered elsewhere,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said initial investigations pointed to death due to drinking. “We suspect the deceased, who had some slight injuries on the head, could have died from illicit brew but a postmortem will establish the cause of death,” he said. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
