Betty Kyallo has blasted Hollywood actor and singer Tyrese over fake news. The actor shared a wedding photo of Betty Kyallo with ex-husband Dennis Okari and a 2019 photo of Okari’s wedding to his wife Joy. The screenshot of what he posted purported that after Okari married Betty, he went on to marry the maid of honour, which in this case was not true as the two women are different. “Just following up on a falsely written post from Tyrese that’s just absurd!" Betty said. "These social media streets could tarnish people’s characters for nothing at all... Tyrese you are a respectable personality get your act right and apologize for this gross character assassination.” Tyrese has since deleted the post.
