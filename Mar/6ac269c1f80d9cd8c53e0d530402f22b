Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu has empanelled a five-judge bench to hear a case filed in Mombasa by Muhuri challenging the verification of BBI signatures. In a notice released Friday evening by the Deputy Registrar Constitutional Division, the case which was transferred to Nairobi will be mentioned next week before the said bench. The bench will be presided over by Justice Joel Ngugi assisted by Justices George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Chacha Mwita and Teresia Matheka. Muhuri moved to court in January to challenge the verification of the BBI signatures. On February 2 this year, Mombasa High Court Judge Eric Ogola transferred the matter to the Acting CJ to empanel a bench. Judge Ogola said Mwilu was the only one who had powers to allocate the file to a five-judge bench. This is after the parties asked the court to consolidate the matter with the eight other petitions before a five-judge bench. “I have no powers to directly transfer this matter to be heard by the said five judge bench instead I forward it to the Chief Justice to either constitute a bench to hear it or to have it consolidated with the other matters being heard by the five judge bench” Ogola ruled.
