There appears to be a 'third wave' of Covid infections hitting Kenya. There have been some high profile deaths and the positivity rate of tests has hit 16 percent, its highest level since the pandemic reached Kenya. This should not be a cause for panic but it should be a cause for caution. This month Kenya started vaccinating health workers with the AstraZeneca vaccine and will soon move onto other groups of frontline workers. This will slow down the spread of Covid-19 in Kenya. The scare stories about AstraZeneca are overdone. The incidence of blood clots in vaccinated Europeans appears to be no greater than the statistical average. It may not be as effective as the Pfizer vaccine but it will still give a high degree of protection. But the vaccine alone will not be enough to stop Covid. People must change their behaviour. The present surge in Covid cases is probably because Kenyans decided that the worst was over. Many stopped social distancing and wearing masks. And now many more Kenyans have been infected. So let's practise self-discipline. Wear a mask, don't socialise in public, distance from other people, and observe the curfew.
