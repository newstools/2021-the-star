Stakeholders have welcomed Kenya Hockey Union's move to start the league next month. KHU released Premier League fixtures on Monday with opening matches slated for April 3at various venues including City Park Stadium, Nairobi. Strathmore University coach Meshack Senge said his charges will be ready for the start of the season despite training for only two weeks. Senge, who tutors both Gladiators and Scorpions teams, said his players will have to shrug off the long lay off and will be ready in two weeks time. "It's good news that the league is resuming. My players have been in training for only two weeks and we are not badly off. Players will use the remaining time to build up on their fitness and I believe we will be ready by the time the league starts." Orange Leonas captain Shila Chenany said it is exciting to be back on the turf and urged  players to prove themselves after a year of inaction. "It's been the longest break we've had as players because of the unprecedented times.  It's been a break that required players to be more accountable than ever as we anticipate the resumption. It is exciting that hockey is back though it's only the top tier. We look forward to the national and Super leagues to start too." Mombasa Sports Club coach Arika Fredrick pointed out that with the pandemic yet to be contained, clubs will have to abide by the Ministry of Health guidelines  and the return to action protocol provided by the Ministry of Sports. "Our priority is to adhere to the protocols put in place but obviously, everybody is eager to return to the field. Asked on whether the Dashmesh Hockey Stadium formerly Simba Union Club— will be used, deputy match and fixture secretary Moses Majiwa said. "City Park is a reference to Nairobi but we can get any other venue as and when we need it." The first leg will run until June 20.
