NARC Kenya party leader Martha Karua now seeks to privately prosecute IEBC officials for electoral offenses they allegedly committed in the 2017 Kirinyaga Gubernatorial elections. In an application filed in court, Karua says the DCI and DPP have failed and refused to prosecute the said officials. Karua says she wrote a complaint to the DCI on December 18 2018 requesting him to investigate the various election-related offences but they are yet to charge the said officials. "Maintaining a more than usual and reasonable retinence, however, the DCI has failed, refused, neglected to investigate and the DPP to prosecute the IEBC officials for the electoral offenses" reads court papers. Through lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, Karua says unless officials are prosecuted now there is a clear likelihood of a failure of public and private justice in this case. "Without a private prosecution, the injustices against Karua at the Kirinyaga County Gubernatorial elections will go unpunished and unredressed" reads court papers Among those to be prosecuted if her application is allowed include James Kangara, Angela Maina, David Mwaniki, Moses Muthike, Julius Maingi, and Samuel Seki She says Kangara bribed voters at different polling centers while Maingi neglected his duty by ignoring information of violation and tampering with sealed ballot boxes. Seki is accused of failing to report the commission of an election offense to IEBC Karua claims Maina, Mwaniki, and Muthike tampered with ballot boxes at Warunguru Girls School tallying centre.
