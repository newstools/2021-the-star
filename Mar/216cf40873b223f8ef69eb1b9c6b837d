The Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was tabled at the Senate on Thursday, after speaker Kenneth Lusaka had initially ordered its deferral. "Honourable Senators, you will recall that I directed that the First Reading of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 be done today," Lusaka said. "Standing Order 140 (1) of the Senate provides that a Bill, having been read a First Time, shall stand committed to the relevant Standing Committee without Question put. In this case, and in line with the directives issued in my Communication yesterday, the Bill stands committed to the Standing Committee on Justice, Legal Affairs and Human Rights." The Committee is required to hold joint sittings with the Departmental Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs of the National Assembly on the Bill and undertake joint public hearings pursuant to Standing Order 224 of the Senate. "Honourable Senators, in view of the importance and urgency of this Bill in our national discourse, I urge the two Committees to expeditiously consider the matter and give feedback to the Houses accordingly," Lusaka said. Meanwhile, the Bill was formally introduced in the National Assembly and would be steered through the next stages by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee. Speaker Justin Muturi introduced the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020, after receiving reports from 42 county assemblies, of which only two presented certificate of rejection.
