Absa Group on Monday announced the passing on of its Executive Director and Deputy Group Chief Executive, Peter Matlare. In a statement released on Monday the group stated that Peter died due to COVID-19-related complications on Sunday. Peter joined the Absa Group Limited board as an independent Non-Executive Director in 2011. In August 2016, he was appointed Group Deputy Chief Executive Officer, as well as Chief Executive responsible for Absa Regional Operations, covering our presence on the continent outside of South Africa. “He played a key role in overseeing our regional operations and safely leading our banks through the major Separation from Barclays and rebrand to Absa,” Absa Group Limited Chairman Wendy Lucas-Bull said. Matlare made a significant contribution to the Group, and Absa said it had lost a dedicated leader, a visionary and an amazing human being. More recently, Peter’s leadership was critical in ensuring that the Separation from Barclays, a complex multi-year project which also included the largest single data and systems migration in Africa, was successful across Absa’s operations on the continent. “Peter was a seasoned corporate executive, a good leader, inspirational, and passionate about his work, always strongly invested in the success of our continent. I will miss his friendship, collegiality, guidance and wise counsel,” Absa Group Chief Executive, Daniel Mminele, said. Absa Kenya CEO Jeremy Awori said the group has lost a great leader whose impact was transformative not just for the group as Absa but also for the business community across the continent. "We will miss Peter’s stewardship which he often delivered with admirable simplicity, warmth and passion, “the CEO said.
