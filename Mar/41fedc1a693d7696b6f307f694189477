The number of Covid-19 infections has been steadily on the rise, with the country on Thursday recording 829 new cases, the highest since last year. Twelve people died in just 24 hours, while the positivity rate is at a high of 14 per cent. The surge, according to Health CS  Mutahi Kagwe, marks the third wave. Of concern, though, is the casual manner in which Kenyans are treating the disease, even at a time when we are not yet out of the woods. The vaccination has just began and barely 4,000 have been inoculated. The initial protective measures like social distancing, face masks, sanitising and washing of hands have mostly been abandoned. Life is back to normal. Politicians are worsening the situation with their super spreader gatherings. Medical experts have warned the third wave could be more devastating than the previous two as the original strain has mutated to a  more potent one. President Uhuru Kenyatta is on Friday expected to review restrictions put in  place in January and there are calls for the escalation of the same. According to Kagwe, Kenya is on a dangerous path if what has been witnessed in other countries that have experienced the third wave is anything to go by. The fight against Covid-19 calls for all of us to be each others brothers keeper. Strict observance of the containment measures already in place will bring down the numbers and give the country adequate time to expand the vaccination campaign Let us not win the battle and lose the war.
