A couple has moved to court seeking to compel Nairobi South Hospital to release two of their newborn babies who are detained at the facility. Charles Ndonye and his wife Virginia Olembo who had quadruplets claim the hospital has detained two of their children born last month. Through lawyer Alex Mola, the couple said the hospital has refused to dialogue with them and come up with modalities of how to clear the Sh3.5 million bill in instalments and has instead chosen to detain the two children. Olembo gave birth on February 1 and was discharged on February 26 with two babies. According to court documents, the hospital told them they would not discharge the two babies because they were still receiving medication but later said they would be released on condition that they clear their bill. "The father has engaged the hospital to have the two babies released including giving a proposal of settling the bill in instalments, but the hospital has refused despite having discharged them," reads court documents. They argue that the decision to hold on to the children is illegal and unlawful and infringes on their rights. They further claim that the bill shot up to Sh4 million because the babies were born pre-term and had to be put on further treatment. "Despite reaching out to friends, relatives and people of good will, the petitioners have been unable to raise the whole amount demanded by the respondent and which fact has been explained to the hospital," read court documents. They claim that they have been going to the hospital hoping for the release of their babies to no avail. "My wife cries every day at the thought of having our sons confined in a hospital," Ndonye claims, adding that the illegal detention of their babies has exposed them to emotional andÂ  psychological torture. "It has exposed the minors to inhuman and degrading treatment through holding them," he says. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
