Sofapaka youngster Ambrose Sifuna has revealed his desire of growing into a top player and eventually wearing the national colours. The former Soy United star has scored once since joining Sofapaka and revealed his determination to build on the solid start. “Scoring at the top level had been a target for me though I wasn’t under any pressure to achieve much because I knew I was beginning and it would just be a matter of time.I never expected to net my maiden goal that quick but it was such an experience and feeling to score my first and winning goal against Nairobi City Stars.” The top-flight league has been such an experience for Sifuna and he only hopes to gain more playing time to mature into a proper player. “I got my first taste of the league against Bandari and thereafter more playing minutes have come my way. The FKF-Premier League is  not only more competitive but physical and tactical as well. More playing minutes have immensely contributed to my growth. My confidence level has improved and I feel am settling in so well,” he said on the club website. Sifuna said he desires to grow into a top player and don the national team colours. “Every player’s wish is to be at their best and represent the country and this not different from my desires too. I am at one of the biggest club’s in the country and I want to use every opportunity to grow way better into a proper player. Playing for the Harambee Stars and beyond the Kenyan league are some of my ambitions too because I have the potential and the desire to achieve my targets.” Sifuna is hoping to be in contention against Gor Mahia when the league season resumes after the international break.
