At least 165 cats and dogs from Nairobi’s Eastlands have been vaccinated against rabies in the just-concluded free mass vaccination . The directorate of veterinary services on Saturday had set up four centres where animals received the jab. At Uhuru (next to Uhuru Secondary School) 71 animals were vaccinated, Mbotela (behind Chief's office) 32,  Maringo Shopping Centre 24  and Harambee Chief's Camp 38. Six dogs with a history of attacking area residents were seized by the county. Rabies is deadly and there is no cure. However, people who have been bitten by a possibly rabid animal can get protection with a series of rabies injections. Veterinarians and animal handlers routinely get rabies injections. Acting director of veterinary services Dr Daniel Karugu said the vaccination was routine and will be carried out in all 17 subcounties. The schedule will be released in coming days. "I urge members of the public who rear dogs and cats to present them for the vaccination as this is for the well-being of the animals and the safety of area residents,” Karugu said. Last year in December the county, Kendat veterinary services, Africa Network for Animal Welfare (Anaw) and Brooke East Africa vaccinated animals in Kasarani subcounty. The free vaccination followed an outbreak of rabies and donkey owners reported cases of 'wild donkey' disease. More than 500 donkeys and 3,000 dogs were vaccinated. Other free rabies vaccinations and free spaying and neutering were provided in other areas in the past. Even rabbits and guinea pigs were vaccinated against rabies. (Edited by V. Graham)
