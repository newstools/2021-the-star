An aircraft on Saturday crashed in Marsabit, killing the pilot and co-pilot. They were the only people on board, the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority said. Eastern regional police boss Noah MwivandaÂ said the fixed wing plane ran into a heavy mist and was badly damaged. The aircraft crashed at Kofia Mbaya area, few kilometers from governor's office on the outskirts of Marsabit town. Mwivanda said that the plane is written 'Mwalimu', but was not carrying exams, contrary to social media reports. He said it was heading for a peace meeting in Ileret area. "It was coming to pick few people here and head to the meeting," he said on the phone. The scene was secured by local security teams. The area is usually foggy in the morning. Officials said the 5YJKN type C208 Operator Aeronav crashed as it navigated a foggy place while flying low. On April 6, 2006 a 14-member team on a peace mission died at the same site when their plane crashed. Among them was North Horr MP Godana Bonaya, Internal Security assistant Minister Mirugi Kariuki, Regional Development assistant Minister Titus Ngoyoni among others.
