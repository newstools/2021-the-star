Kenya Simbas will start training next month ahead of the Africa Cup fixtures in July. Kenya Rugby Union chairman Oduor Gangla said players will have found some rhythm to their game following the start of the Kenya Cup two weeks ago. By the time the preparations begin, Gangla said, the players will have played at least which will be key following a wasted 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. "Plans are in place for the team to start training camp in April at the bare minimum," said Gangla. "The players will have at least five matches under their belts which will be good for the team.” Gangla added that a proposed training camp in Stellenbosch, South Africa in April — which will cost Sh20 million — is still on course. “We have started fundraising for this cause. We are speaking to the Ministry of Sports to see if they can offset some of the costs involved in this trip and, on the other hand, we are speaking to some of our partners to see if they can support us," added Gangla. The Simbas will play two build-up matches in addition to a high-performance training camp in readiness for the continental matchups against Zambia and Senegal — must-win matches if are thy to take part in the final round of the World Cup qualifiers slated for next year. Head coach Paul Odera said the coaching team has been sending training tips to players as well as conducting meetings on Zoom to keep the players up to speed. “We have just a year to get things right for the qualifiers. We must be at our best for the two games in July in terms of selection, tactical strengths and management in order to progress to the final round of the qualifiers,” said Odera. The Simbas missed out on the 2019 World Cup in Japan after losing all their three matches in the repechage — against Germany, Hong Kong and Canada. In 2014, Kenya missed the automatic ticket for the 2015 edition in the United Kingdom after losing to Zimbabwe during the final qualifiers in Madagascar.
