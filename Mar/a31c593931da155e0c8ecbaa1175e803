Kenya Hockey Union have earmarked City Park Stadium and Sikh Union as venues for league matches set to begin next month after a long hiatus due to Covid-19. KHU chairman Nashon Randiek said City Park will play host to the matches, at least until renovation on the stadium commences. "We will use City Park for the time being for our league matches. Simba Union pitch is an option for too," Randiek said. Sikh Union Stadium, commonly known as Dashmesh Hockey Stadium, is the only club-owned astroturf in the country. The dilapidated state of hockey pitches across the country has been a cause for concern for stakeholders as Kenya's fortunes in the sport continues to dwindle. The Premier League is set to resume next month after the Ministry of Sports okayed the resumption of the sport, among other disciplines, including football and rugby. Deputy match and fixtures secretary Moses Majiwa said KHU has been meeting with clubs to lay the groundwork for the resumption, including match fixtures and Covid-19 protocols. "Teams will have to prepare their own protocols at their own training grounds and KHU will inspect. If we are able to manage our environment, we can request for  other leagues to resume but right now its difficult. We are operating in unusual environment and the covid-19 situation changes everyday," Majiwa said. He said KHU will next week release the fixtures for top-tier league whose  first leg of matches will  run until July. The Kenya Hockey Union will next week ahead of Premier League next month. "We will hold a meeting with technical officials on easing clubs to action. A month is more than enough for players to get back to their top fitness levels," Majiwa said.
