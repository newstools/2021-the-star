Famous American philosopher Elbert Hubbart once said that responsibility is the price of freedom. Going by Hubbart's words of we owe a duty of preservation to our children and the children of our children as a nation. One of the ways through which this duty is undertaken is by supporting the private Bill by Garissa Township MP Adan Duale, which seeks to criminalise the sharing of pornographic content on mobile phones and cyber space. The Computer Misuse and Cyber crimes (Amendment) Act, 2020 is set for publication and introduction in the National Assembly for consideration this week. The proposed law imposes a fine of Sh20 million or 20 years in jail for anyone found sharing pornography. It also wants sharing and publishing of such material made illegal.It further seeks to compel the government to block access to porn websites in Kenya. If approved, the law will act as a deterrent. Inasmuch as freedom is good, if left unchecked, it can cause more harm than good, especially with the digital age where every youngster has access to phones with internet connectivity. It is difficult even for parents to monitor their kids and what they are exposed to on different forums. And because of the good intentions of the Bill, the MPs should back it. On their part, parents, too, should take it upon themselves to sensitise their children on what's good for consumption on social media and what is harmful.
