A tussle over fare between lovebirds ended in a Makadara court on Friday, when a woman admitted to stealing boyfriend's phones after he refused to refund her travel allowance. Nelius Wangui was charged at a Makadara law court with stealing two mobile phones worth Sh37, 500 and Sh40,300 from Eric Basweti on March 18 in South B, Nairobi county. Wangui also faced an alternative count of being in possession of stolen goods. She admitted to the offences before Makadara chief magistrate Angelo Kithinji on Friday. She told the court the complainant, Basweti, is indeed her boyfriend and that he had refused to honour his promise of giving and refunding her fare back. She had travelled from Nakuru to see him. On the morning of the material day, the two were together in the house when the boyfriend went to the bathroom. When Basweti got back, he found Wangui had left and his twoÂ  phones missing. He rushed to a Safaricom shop to replace his line but discovered Wangui had already transferred money from his two mobile phones amounting to Sh40,300 to different lines. She was later arrested and taken to Kabete police station after a trap was set. Kithinji freed her on a Sh 50,000 bail and ordered the matter to be mentioned on April 6. Edited EKibii.
