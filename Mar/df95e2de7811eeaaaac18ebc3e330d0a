The Teachers Service Commission on Thursday launched the Covid-19 vaccination of tutors with those manning KCPE and KCSE exams targeted. Commission CEO Nancy Macharia said the jab will be optional but encouraged teachers to get vaccinated for their own good. She was the first to get vaccinated during the launch at TSC headquarters in Nairobi. Macharia said those aged 50 and above have also been prioritised for the vaccine. She said no teacher will be forced to take the jab. Macharia spoke at the TSC headquarters in Nairobi during the launch of the vaccination drive for teachers. The national Covid-19 task force for vaccine deployment chairman Willis Akhwale was present. Macharia said they were negotiating for the target group to be expanded to include those with underlying conditions regardless of their ages. Forty-four teachers in both primary and secondary schools have so far succumbed to Covid-19 related complications since the outbreak of the virus a year ago. This year, the Kenya National Examination Council says 286,901 supervisors and invigilators will be contracted for KCPE and KCSE exams administration. The invigilators, supervisors and markers are strictly picked from in-service teachers registered with the TSC. If the proposal to have the exam officials prioritised in the vaccination is approved, it will mean the bulk of teachers in the country will have been vaccinated in this first phase. Currently, the country has a population of 387,000 teachers in public schools and another 150,000 in private schools. The vaccination will take place in the exam centres. Akhwale said non-teaching staff in various schools will not be inoculated in this first phase. “We are beginning with the teaching staff, and soon when we get another consignment of about one million extra doses, we are going to cover other staff,” Akhwale said. Those vaccinated must get a second dose according to the vaccine administration guidelines.  Edited by P.O
