The University of Nairobi has announced plans to kick out students who among other reasons are in the institution for a period longer than their course requirement. The deregistration of the students will take effect on March 22. UoN deputy vice chancellor academic affairs Julius Ogeng’o in a memo released on Monday, said students who have been expelled, discontinued, temporarily withdrawn and those serving deferment or suspension will be affected. Also to be deregistered are students with unexplained failure to transit to the subsequent level. “Senate, at its meeting held on August 26, approved Guidelines for Student Progression, 2020, which were to be implemented with effect from September 2020… These guidelines provide for termination of students progression and deregistration,” the memo reads. However, the memo does not reveal whether it only applies to undergraduate students. In 2019, the Education ministry raised concerns that scholars taking doctorate programmes were taking an average of five years to complete instead of the required two years. “Students who need assistance, more information, and/or further clarification may contact their respective Deans / Directors; Director Graduate School; or Academic Registrar,” the memo reads. According to the university website, those seeking readmission to the institution can do so by writing a letter to the academic registrar through their dean or director. The University of Nairobi has close to 70,000 students both in the government and self-sponsored programmes. In March last year, UoN students staged protests to raise concerns over insecurity. The students alleged that some former students had turned into goons and were responsible for chaos, riots, and notoriety that is often blamed on students. Vice chancellor Stephen Kiama on Tuesday told the Star that the institution seeks to keep a clean record of students.
