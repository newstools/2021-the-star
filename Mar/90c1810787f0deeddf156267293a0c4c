Each day for over a decade now, you would be sure to read about the happenings in Embu and the adjacent regions in the Star courtesy of the consistency and passion of Reuben Githinji. The 52-year-old father of one died at a Murang’a hospital on Wednesday. His daughter is a KCSE candidate in the area. He also leaves behind a widow. For 13 years, Githinji has generated stories about the daily happenings in the area. Most of them were public interest-spirited, highlighting issues that directly affected the lives of the residents of the region. From insecurity incidents, bad roads, rogue pastors, dilapidated school infrastructures, farming issues, to social welfare of the elderly among others, Githinji’s pen would get the ears of the powerful to act. Local politicians including Mbeere South MP Geoffrey King'ang'i said the journalist's death was a big blow to the residents of Embu. "His reporting was objective and balanced. We have lost a good writer,” he said. The lawmaker said Githinji was friendly in his work and that his reportage was consistent, covering development and political events. The Star news editor Francis Mureithi said the death of Githinji was sad and unfortunate, describing him as a reliable reporter committed to his work. "We have lost one of the most dependable and hard working writers,” he said. “His work as a journalist stood for itself, a humble and soft spoken man who hardly complained," Mureithi added. His sister Grace Waceke said the journalist had developed Covid-like symptoms last week and was complaining of difficulty in breathing before being rushed to Embu Referral Hospital. He needed ventilatory support to breath. The doctors referred him to ICU but all the beds at the facility were occupied, so he got rushed to a Murang’a hospital. He died there on Wednesday at 8:30am. Burial arrangements are underway at his Nyahururu home.
