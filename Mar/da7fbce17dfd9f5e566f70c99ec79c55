A Kibera court has allowed detectives 14 days to hold two suspects for allegedly stealing businesswoman Carolyne Wanjiku's Sh350,000 and her phone before killing her. Justus Nyamatete Manyora and Innocent Omae Ombati were detained on Tuesday after a successful application by police constable Willy Bungei attached to Dagoreti DCI. Bungei told the court that the two suspects were arrested on March 5 in Suneka, Kisii, and were in possession of the slain businesswoman's mobile phone. "Your honour, the two respondents were arrested on March 5 in Kisii and were in possession of Wanjiku's Sh350,000 cash alongside her communications gadget," he told the court. He said the two are directly linked to the disappearance and subsequent murder of the businesswoman and that he needed 14 days to complete his investigation. "Fourteen days are enough for me to do a psychiatric test on the suspects among other investigations and, your honour, the respondents are a flight risk if released on bail," he added. The two will be charged with murder at the Milimani courts. In his ruling, the magistrate said that the application had merit and a life was lost hence the need to detain the suspects. This comes after two other suspects were charged Monday at the Milimani court with the murder of Carolyne Wanjiku. They were detained after police filed a miscellaneous application in court. Wanjiku was abducted in Nairobi on February 12 and brutally murdered before her body was dumped in a thicket in Kajiado county.
