The BBI secretariat on Thursday made its case for the proposed changes to the Constitution, saying the envisioned reforms will address challenges the country faces. Led by co-chairs Junet Mohamed and Dennis Waweru, the team appeared before the joint Justice and Legal Affairs Committees during the public hearing on the BBI Bill in Parliament. The team, through their experts, Tom Macharia and Ben Sihanya, took the committees through every amendment, underscoring the need for every change. "I urge the committee to consider this Bill. We should not politicize this process," Junet said. Priscilla Nyokabi, a director at the Secretariat, said the bill seeks to unlock the country's economic potential, realise the elusive two-thirds gender rule and expedite corruption cases to arrest the vice. "The country has concentrated so much on sharing the cake. Not much has been said about the baking the cake. BBI talks about economy and shared prosperity," she said. She added, " As we were building bridges, women were also keen that pending issues such as two-thirds rule is implemented in this opportunity." Sihanya said that the BBI ensures equality and quality of the vote. He said adding more constituencies will ensure quality of the vote while elected a male and a female to the Senate will ensure equality. "There has been need for fairness and openness in representation in counties," he said.
