Arsenal midfielder Martin Odegaard has adapted very quickly after arriving on loan from Real Madrid in January and the Norwegian can only get better, manager Mikel Arteta said on Wednesday. Odegaard, 22, has scored in his last two games, grabbing Arsenal’s opener in the first leg of the Europa League last-16 tie against Olympiakos as well as Sunday’s derby win over Tottenham Hotspur. “I think everybody has been really impressed with how quickly he adapted, how professional he is, how quickly he engaged with everybody and the performances he is putting in as well,” Arteta told reporters. “I think his understanding of what we want is excellent. His work rate has been phenomenal and he’s doing something which in my opinion he could improve a lot, which is getting in the opponents’ box and being more decisive in the score line. “He’s doing that, he’s scored two goals, he’s got some really important entrances in the zone and he looks all the time really dangerous. It’s something that if he adds that to his game he becomes a real complete player.”
