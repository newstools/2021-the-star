Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange has succumbed to Covid-19 related complications. He passed on at Nairobi Hospital where he was undergoing treatment on Wednesday at dawn. Koinange was the Chairperson, Departmental Committee on Administration and National Security. President Uhuru Kenyatta mourned the departed MP as one of the country’s dependable leaders. “His undivided focus was the unity, stability and progress of the country,” the President said. Koinange was a key cog in the campaigns for the building bridges initiative in Kiambu county. Uhuru mourned him as a keen and steadfast supporter of the country's peace agenda through the House committee he chaired. The President said the MP advanced legislation and policy interventions that sought to create a peaceful, stable and tranquil nation. “The cruel hand of death has robbed us of a steadfast leader. A leader and gentleman whose undivided focus was the peace, stability and progress of our country," Uhuru said. "I pray to God to give strength and fortitude to the family, relatives and residents of Kiambaa Constituency at this difficult time of mourning,” the PSCU said in a statement. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi said the National Assembly has been robbed off a very committed and dependable Member of Parliament. "It is very sad that the country has lost him at such a time, just when he was spearheading his Committee in the efforts to consolidate peace and security among communities involved in inter-ethnic conflicts across the country."
