Politicians found misusing their guns during election campaigns will have their firearm licences revoked, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said Friday. Matiang'i said the violence witnessed during Thursday's by-elections in Kabuchai, Matungu and Nakuru is unacceptable. “The reason why this has continued for a long time is because people don’t face the real consequences,” the CS said. He spoke at the launch of the National Land Commission Strategic Plan 2021-2026 in Nairobi. During Thursday's by-elections, former Sports CS Rashid Echesa was caught on camera slapping an election official while Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala's bodyguard was arrested for shooting a resident. "Apart from withdrawal of firearms, the government will have to invoke Chapter 6 of the Constitution and state officials will be going to court themselves to clear any politician involved in violence to be declared unfit for any Public Office," Matiang'i said. He decried the fair bail terms and prosecution delays for prominent politicians. The CS said the police officers are frustrated because it’s the leaders who should be setting a good example that are breaking rules.
