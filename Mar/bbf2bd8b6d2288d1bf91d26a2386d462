Wiper party's Agnes Kavindu is on the brink of winning the Machakos Senate by-election. By early Friday, Kavindu had garnered 104,0802 votes against her closest competitor Urbanus Ngengele (UDA) who got 19, 705. Voting was done on Thursday. The by-election came about following the death of Boniface Kabaka on December 11, last year. Former Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama has suffered  a major political setback in his backyard following the loss of Ngengele. The loss brings  into sharp focus his ability to deliver for Deputy President William Ruto in the general election next year. In a clear indication that Muthama's popularity could be waning in Machakos county, his backed senatorial candidate has lost by  a huge margin to Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper party. Muthama is the chairman of Ruto's wheelbarrow party officially known as the United Democratic Alliance. A victory in the by-election would have gone a long way in boosting his fortunes in a region that has for decades been under Kalonzo's firm grip.
