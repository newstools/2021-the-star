Umoja stunned Emyba 80-61 in a Premier League clash played at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. This 'Eastlands' derby got off to a slow start with Umoja controlling play and taking a 24-11 edge in the first quarter. In the second stanza, Emyba pushed the button managing a 18-15 cushion but were down 39-29 at the breather. Emyba, who stunned Thunder 75-63 the previous day, trailed 17-16 in the third quarter and were down 69-53 with three minutes to play. Umoja tactician Kevin Sunguti hailed his boys' display saying they showed character as they posted their first win in four matches. "Our problem has been the failure to train as a team. It is only this week we managed to train together. We know Emyba very well since we train together and this worked to our advantage," said Sunguti. Michael Munene scored 15 points, Colins Sudi shot 14Â  while Brian Oyoo provided 12 for Umoja. Emmanuel Ekai registered the losers game-high 12. In the women's tie, Storms crushed Kenyatta University Oryx 66-36 with coach Abel Nson praising his charges for outstanding performance. "I missed my senior player," said Nson. Jemimah Omondi posted 21 points and Lynette Atieno added 20 as the duo recorded a total of eight three-pointers. "Beating an experienced team is a problem but I didn't expect to lose by that margin. We played badly," noted KU coach Gitau Waringo. Zetech sparks switched off the University of Nairobi 'Dynamites' 40-37. UoN coach Juma Kent said: "We started badly but we recovered well in time. Inexperience from first years did us in. 14 days ago I lost to them by 29 points in the varsity league in Mombasa." Debbie Obunga and Beryl Aoko combined for Sparks' 15 points, UoN's Triza Akeyo picked up 13 and Liz Okumu notched 10.
