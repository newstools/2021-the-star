Isuzu East Africa has come out to set the record straight after allegations that a bus donated to a school in Tigania West by the Deputy President William Ruto had been repossessed by the firm. A letter purporting to originate from the company which did the rounds on social media indicated that repossession was done because of “delayed payment”. "We have noted that the letter’s misleading contents also appeared in a story published online by one of the leading daily newspapers," Isuzu said. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Isuzu stated that Kianjai Girls Secondary School placed an order with Isuzu East Africa for a 46-seater bus in September 2019. The payment was completed in December 2020. "Subsequently, a chassis was allocated and bus body fabrication commenced," the company said. Isuzu further said that the bus has recently been completed and number plates issued and are expected to make delivery of the bus to the school next week. "We take this opportunity to thank the school’s management for choosing Isuzu as their preferred transport solutions partner. We affirm our commitment to provide excellent after sales support and ensure the bus continues to offer safe and comfortable transportation for Kianjai Girls Secondary School," the company concluded.
