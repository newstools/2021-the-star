Mombasa County Governor Hassan Joho has declared support to the son of the late Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji. Joho who is the ODM deputy party leader said this when he hosted the Jubilee Party candidate on Thursday, a day after receiving a direct ticket in readiness for the May 18 by-election. Abdul Yusuf Haji will be seeking to replace his late father in the Senate. Joho said he is positive that Abduls' dynamism, integrity, and ingeniousness will propel the county of Garissa to greater heights. “His candidature for the upcoming Garissa senatorial by-election elicits not only excitement but also hope and prosperity for the younger generation. I will therefore support his bid,” Joho said. The Garissa mini polls come following the death of senator Haji who died on February 15 after a long illness. The move comes hours after One Kenya Alliance said it will not participate in the forthcoming by-elections and will instead support the Jubilee candidate. One Kenya Alliance brings together Kanu, Wiper, Ford Kenya and ANC parties.
