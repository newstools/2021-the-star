Former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama has congratulated his ex-wife Agnes Kavindu for winning the concluded Senate Machakos by-election. Through his Twitter account on Saturday, Muthama assured Kavindu of his support as he takes the responsibility of representing his people in the Senate. Kavindu contested the race under Kalonzo Musyoka’s Wiper party, emerging the winner with 104,0802 votes as Urbanus Ngengele of UDA came second with 20,000 votes. Kavindu got 78 per cent of the total votes cast, while UDA, a party associated with the Deputy President, managed 15 per cent. UDA chairman Muthama was under pressure to deliver the Machakos seat to Ruto, who has been making inroads in the Ukambani region. Following the win, Kalonzo thanked the residents for their overwhelming vote in favour of Kavindu. On Friday, Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr said he was sure the Wiper candidate was going to win. “The Wiper candidate is going to beat the UDA candidate with a huge margin. The UDA candidate is advised to concede or wait for landslide shocks,” he said moments before the results were officially declared. Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei, an ally of Ruto, however, said UDA supporters did not come out in numbers to vote for their candidate because they had been intimidated by government officials. Maendeleo Chap chap party of Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua withdrew from the race two days to the D-Day,  leaving the battle between the Wiper party and UDA. Mutua said they arrived at the decision following the statement issued by the President, calling on friendly political parties, especially in Machakos, to find a peaceful, amicable and uniting way forward during the upcoming by-elections.
