Kakamega County Government has hinted on plans to partner with soccer giants AFC Leopards in nurturing talent in the Western regionâ€”the home of football talent. The two also discussed ways of leveraging on the huge fanatical support the club enjoys to market and brand the iconic Bukhungu Stadium among other sports facilities in Kakamega County. The county executive for Social Services, Youths, Women Empowerment, Sports and Culture, Were Kassim , who is also the patron of AFC Leopards' western branch, said the club's achievements over the years can be used to motivate other upcoming players. Were Kassim was speaking during a meeting with AFC Leopards' officials led by the club chairman Dr. Dan Shikanda. He said they are happy with the progress of the club especially in this year's Premier League. "For a very long time, we have not witnessed the kind of consistence AFC Leopards are exhibiting now. This is very encouraging and it will make more fans troop back into stadium," he noted. He urged the players to give their best and remain focused on the top prize as they strive to reclaim their lost glory. Dr. Shikanda, who was accompanied by treasurer Morris Chichi, thanked Were and the county government for choosing AFC Leopards for partnership.
