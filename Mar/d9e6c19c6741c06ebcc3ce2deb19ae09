Deputy President William Ruto has urged the police service to offer their services to Kenyans across the country without discrimination. Speaking in Nakuru on Thursday, the DP said ‘the biggest threat that this country can face is if the police service is partisan or responds to political interests”. Ruto added that the police service has no excuse and they should not blame any faction in the country, but instead, they should ensure that the property and rights of the citizens are safeguarded. The DP’s comments come following skirmishes that were witnessed during by-elections in Matungu and Kabuchai constituencies and London Ward in Nakuru. The DP reminded the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai and the entire Police Service that the police is an independent unit that should carry out its operation as stipulated in the constitution. “They must discharge their responsibilities as required of them by the constitution and they will carry the responsibility if they do not measure up to what the constitution expects of them,” Ruto said. He added that “We expect that the Judiciary will stand up to be counted as an independent institution and not to listen to any lectures from any quarters.” The DP attended the funeral service of Arthur Kinyanjui, the son of the Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri. The MP’s son succumbed to coronavirus.
