Uasin Gishu County Assembly has voted to abstain from debating and taking a vote on the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The MCAs at the assembly unanimously argued that it was unnecessary for them to take a decision on the BBI and instead they would let Kenyans decide if it's taken to the referendum. The county which is DP William Ruto's home was the last to take a decision on the BBI and the only one that has decided to abstain. The assembly session was chaired by speaker David Kiplagat who said the MCAs had the right to abstain on the matter. Nandi and Baringo were the only assemblies who rejected the BBI while 44 others supported. More to follow
