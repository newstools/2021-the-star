Gor Mahia duo of Kenneth Muguna and Boniface Oluoch could find themselves in hot soup following the violent incidents reported during their Caf Confederations Cup preliminary round return leg against  Zambia's Napsa Stars. This is after Caf wrote to the club indicating the looming disciplinary investigations on the two senior players on the alleged scuffle at the Heros Stadium after the final whistle. The two were accused of accosting and insulting the centre referee Lebalang Mokete after the match, which dramatically ended 2-2 denying Gor an opportunity to return to the group stages. “CAF has decided to implement the provisions of the Disciplinary Code in terms of article 11, and to open an investigation allowing your affiliated players to respond to the reported incident,” read a letter from Cairo Gor was on the verge of advancing to the pools until the Mosotho referee gave Napsa a contentious penalty in the dying seconds of the game which former Southampton striker Emmanuel Mayuka slotted past Oluoch to send Gor packing. The Pensioners had won the first leg played at the Nyayo National Stadium 1-0,  leaving Gor with a herculean task of fighting for an away win.
