Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper Party has thrown its weight behind the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and urged MPs to approve it. The party on Monday said that the proposed constitutional changes will fix the perennial challenges the country has grappled with for years. "BBI is addressing the structural problems, inequality and unemployment that we held us back for years," vice-chairperson Victor Swanya said. Swanya presented the party's memorandum on the BBI Bill during the ongoing public hearing in Parliament. The joint Justice and Legal Affairs Committees of Parliament are hosting the hearings at the Senate chamber. Swanya said that the proposal to create a commission to deal with youth issues, increasing funds to counties and the five per cent allocation to Ward Development Funds are issues that are dear to the party. A lobby group, Youth for BBI chaired by Alex Matere also presented their views to the MPs and supported the Bill. They said the BBI Bill seeks to fix problem facing Kenya's youth.
