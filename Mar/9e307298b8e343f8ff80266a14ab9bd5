E-commerce platform Jumia has announced the launch of a food festival campaign which will take place from March 19  to April 4. Consumers will get free and fast delivery from hundreds of restaurants, supermarkets and shops with Jumia Prime. Jumia Prime is a loyalty program which allows its members to benefit from free delivery on their Jumia and Jumia food orders, in addition to exclusive promotions. Three month subscriptions starts from Sh 499, six months free delivery from Sh 1,099 while annual subscription is Sh 1,999. “We hope that this campaign will surprise and delight our customers. A great meal, delivered fast is good for the soul! And good for restaurants. Much of the industry is struggling to get back on its feet - and very much still feeling the effects of Covid,” Jumia CEO Sam Chappatte said adding that Jumia Food is ramping up capacity to support restaurants over the extended curfew period. The campaign is organized in partnership with local restaurants like Ukwaju bites Bhajia house, Nyama mama, Zubidubi, 10 street, Mikaye and Baba Nyama Choma, as well as Steers, Debonairs, Fogo gaucho and Big Square. This follows the president’s directive to extend the curfew for additional 60-days following the increased rate of 3rd wave of Covid-19 in Kenya. “60% of our growth in Kenya is attributed to Jumia Food - in particular their aggressive marketing and continuous  support,” said James Ouma, Franchise Manager, Debonairs Pizza, Kenya.
