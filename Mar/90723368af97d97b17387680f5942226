Directorate of Criminal Investigation coach Daniel Bor is worried of the threat posed by Kenya Defence Forces ahead of their meeting on Friday at Nyayo Stadium. DCI will book a play-off slot should they win. DCI have registered two wins in three matches to rank fourth in the seven-team league. Despite being pre-match favourites, Bor admits the match comes with added pressure but called on his charges to maintain focus. KDF, who are bottom of the table, will be looking for their first win as they seek to  write off the wrongs. In their last meeting in Nyeri before the coronavirus struck,  the soldiers lost to DCI 3-0 . "We have to play with the right mindset and win the match. Morale is high and we have no injury issues. We intend to use the  remaining training sessions  to fine-tune our weak links," he added. Bor warned against underrating  their opponents. He said KDF is new-look young team with a quality technical bench and can upset any team on their day. "We won't take them lightly because they are equally a good side and very competitive. Losing one match doesn't mean they are short of quality. It is pretty difficult to know what to expect from them because there are so many changes in that team." DCI finished fourth in the 2019 league season and are keen to enter the medal bracket this season as they seek to represent the country at the Africa Club Championship. DCI will be banking on Malkia Strikers middle blocker Caroline Sirengo, left attacker Veronicah Adhiambo and libero player Josephine Wafula. "I hope the trio will have a good match. Wafula brings experience and will be called to defend the back court. Adhiambo,  a Sega High School alumnus is promising despite being inexperienced. Sirengo is another vital player for us."
