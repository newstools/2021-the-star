The government has promised to crack the whip on gangs terrorising residents of Kutus in Kirinyaga at night. Interior PS  Karanja Kibicho said the government will by the end of the week restore order in the fast-growing Kirinyaga county town. “I have heard about the insecurity state in Kutus and hopefully in a week’s time there will be a remarkable difference in the town,” he said. Kibicho urged residents to work hand in hand with security officers to help smoke out those brutalising others. “It’s preferable to work with wananchi because no matter how many security officers there are on the ground, wananchi  are the eyes through which we can evaluate the state of insecurity in an area,” the PS said. Kibicho spoke in Gichugu when he met students from Gacatha Day Secondary school. His statement comes days after the Star reported the anguish of residents in the hands of gangs of young men usually armed with knives. They stab and mug residents returning home from work. Residents are forced to close their businesses as early as 6pm for the fear of bumping unto the criminals who take charge of the town as darkness creeps in. They said since schools reopened at the beginning of the year, insecurity has risen to an uncontrollable level. “Students and especially those from Kirinyaga University are their main target. Most of them are robbed of money, phones, laptops and other expensive gadgets,” said David Muriuki, a boda boda rider. Kibicho discouraged day secondary school managements from converting their institutions into boarding schools. He instead advised them to use the resources they receive to improve their schools with modern learning infrastructure. Edited by Henry Makori
