National cross country team has officially wound up its residential camp at Kigari Teachers' Training College, Embu. This follows last week's postponement of the Africa Cross Country Championships in Lome, Togo. Athletics Kenya announced the decision after a visit to the 42 athletes who have been preparing for the continental event for the past three weeks. "AK together with the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Heritage have resolved to wind up residential training camp today, following the postponement of the Africa Cross Championships earlier slated for Lome, Togo," the federation said in a statement. Following increasing cases of Covid-19 infections in the West African nation, Togolese authorities requested the Confederation of African Athletics to postpone the event to a later date. Subsequently, AK had resolved to keep the residential camp open as they consulted CAA on the way forward. Additionally, AK president Jack Tuwei said the federation had asked CAA if they were considering an alternative venue for the biennial championships. "You see we have to salvage the championships because cross country is such an important race for athletes. Being an Olympics year, there is need to give the athletes as many opportunities to compete as possible," Tuwei said. However, the latest development means the athletes will have to shift their focus on other events in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics. AK have lined up a series of athletics events, including the World Relay Championships trials and track and field weekend meetings. Continentally, athletes will be gearing up for 22nd African Senior Championships in Algeria and Eastern Region Under-18 Championships in Uganda.
