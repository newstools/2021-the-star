Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed has petitioned the European Tour to stage one more world-class golf event in Kenya in addition to the Magical Kenya Open and the Savannah Classic. She said Kenya has more to offer in terms of memorable experiences across world-class golf courses besides the Karen Country Club where the two events have been held thus far. "What our request to the European Tour is not to make this a one-off. We should continue having these back-to-back tournaments and hopefully, add another one  and have them across the country so that we are not having all these events here at Karen. We have beautiful golf courses across the country and I think it would be wonderful for people to experience them,”Amina said. The CS said hosting the two events a week apart was a badge of honour that Kenya would wear with pride for many years to come. "It's the first time you have two championships back-to-back. We feel extremely privileged, and I think it gives us that badge of honour, but it also allows Kenya to be seen as a sporting destination. "As you know, we have hosted very many sporting events and so having this additional tournament here just confirms that we are actually a sporting giant on the continent,”  she said. Amina was speaking at the Karen Country Club during the ongoing Savannah Classic, which is in its third day.  The inaugural event follows the Magical Kenya Open held at the same venue last week, where  South African Justin Harding emerged victorious.
