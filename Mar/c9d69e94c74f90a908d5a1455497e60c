The government has released its roll-out plan of administering the first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine which arrived in the country on Tuesday night. In a statement on Wednesday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said 400,000 healthcare workers countrywide as well as other essential service providers will receive the vaccine on Friday in phase one of the vaccination plan. The CS maintained that 1.25 million Kenyans will receive a dose of the first batch of the Astrazeneca vaccine and politicians are not on the list. This follows controversial claims on social media that politicians plan on jumping the queue to get access to Covid vaccines. Kagwe dismissing the claims said, "The target population to be covered in this first phase remains 1.25 million and does not include politicians as erroneously reported in a section of the media today." "The vaccine is going to be distributed in our referral hospitals countrywide including level fours and threes. We are working with county governments to ensure seamless operation," he said. Meanwhile, Kagwe announced that 331  people have tested positive for the virus from a sample size of 4,725 bringing the country's case load to 106,801. The country's fatalities have risen to 1,866 after another three  patients succumbed to the disease. Kagwe said that there are 403 patients currently admitted in various hospitals across the country. Another, 1,536 patients are on the home-based care programme. A total of 61 patients are in ICU, out of which 24 are on ventilatory support. Also, 16 patients are separately on supplementary oxygen in general wards. Meanwhile, 54 patients have recovered from the disease out of which 44 were from the Homebased care program while 10 were discharged from various health facilities. Kenya's recoveries now stand at 86,914.
