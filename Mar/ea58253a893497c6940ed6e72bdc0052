Keroche Breweries heiress Anerlisa Muigai has shared a cryptic message with her fans on social media, hinting she might be expecting her first child with her husband, Tanzanian singer Ben Pol. Through her Insta stories, Anerlisa shared a video of herself holding the bump and captioned it, “How I feel today.” She had earlier shared a video while at the Nairobi Hospital and captioned it, 'Not every time you go to the hospital is bad news, God is good is all I can say. Feeling blessed with my mum in NH.' In a different post, she shared another video clip that highlighted all the pregnancy symptoms, making clear her current status. Earlier this year, she confirmed she was ready to start a family with Pol. The couple got engaged in 2019 and tied the knot at a secret lavish wedding in Tanzania last year.
