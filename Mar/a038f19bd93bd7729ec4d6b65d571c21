The Ngong Road derby will highlight the Kenya Cup Match Day 3 action on Saturday. Quins will be seeking their first win of the season after two defeats to Menengai Oilers (39-13) and KCB ( 35-32) and the stakes could be higher in what will be an explosive encounter at the Impala Club. Head coach Antoine Plasman will be hoping for a good start against their rivals after slow start cost them dearly in the match against champions KCB last weekend. “We improved considerably in the second half but we need to put  in a good  performance from the first whistle to the last minute in order to win the match,” added Plasman. The Belgian termed the derby game against Impala as tough, saying he expects a competitive contest. “I know they have not played a game yet but I expect to come out firing and play hard,” he added. Plasman will go for the tried and tested forwards in the encounter including skipper Elisha Koronya, Melvin Thairu and Brian Waraba  with Wilson Kopondo and Hillary Baraza in the second row. The burly Joshua Chisanga, Edward Shitanda and the evergreen Patrice Agunda will be in the back-row. Xavier Kipng'etich and Evin Asena will be the halfback pairing with Mark Wandetto and Dennis Muhanji—the key actors in the backline.  In the earlier kickoff, Mwamba open their season campaign against Blak Blad as Menengai Oilers encounter Nakuru RFC in a tough Rift valley derby.  Kabras, KCB Strathmore Leos, Masinde Muliro of Science and Technology  and Nondies will rest for the weekend fixtures.
