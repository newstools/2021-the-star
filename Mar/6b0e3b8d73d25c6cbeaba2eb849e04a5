Nominated Senator Millicent Omanga says she made her first million at the age of 19 as a student at the University of Nairobi. Speaking on Jessy Junction on Monday, Omanga said she ventured into a side hustle of selling bedsheets. "I started a business while at UoN. I would go to Eastleigh, buy some merchandise then sell to my fellow students at the facility. That is how I made my first million and bought a car." She added that she received a tender from a local hotel to supply bedsheets. She got a loan to meet the requirements and supply the bedsheets and the hotel paid her Sh1 million. "I would not pay school fees at the beginning of the semester. I used the money to start a business, but by the end of the semester, I would have collected the money paid school fees before the exam time and also made a profit," she stated.
