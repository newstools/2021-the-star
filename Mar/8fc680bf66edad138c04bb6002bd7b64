Over 60 cars and 20 motorbikes have confirmed participation in this year’s 4x4 Tulon Forest Conservation Challenge set for Easter Holidays in Nandi County. Event director, Basil Maiyo, said the 4th edition will run from  April 2-5. He said they skipped last year’s event due to the coronavirus pandemic. “This time round, we are hosting two events in one because there has been a growing demand from Enduro, whose fan base has really grown. So far, we have 60 cars and 10 bikers who have entered the competition,” said Maiyo. He added that it will be the first time they will be hosting two events in one since they began the showpiece three years ago. “Our target is to promote sports tourism in Nandi County, a well-known region for top sportsmen and women in the country and beyond,” added Maiyo. The event is an off-road motorsport and motor-cross competition where participants are expected to brave selected tough-to-navigate hotspots. The hotspots are perfectly selected to offer a requisite level of complexity in terms of terrain as well as offer fans panoramic views of the skyline and other tourism attractions. “This will be the greatest venture in protecting Sitatunga Forest, which is so endangered and we will be planting  trees in Kimondi Forest in Nandi,” he added. “The event is expected to bring together hundreds of individuals from across the country thus marketing Nandi as a tourist destination,” said Maiyo. The organisers said the introduction of motor cross is meant to give an opportunity to other riders who want to experience the terrains of Nandi on their motorcycles.
