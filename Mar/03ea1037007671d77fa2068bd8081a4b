 Some 94 KCPE candidates in Makueni did not turn up for the test that started on Monday, county commissioner Mohamed Maalim has said. A total of 34,948 candidates were registered for the exam in the county. Maalim on Tuesday said the county had registered 17,489 boys and 17,459 girls for KCPE exam this year. Most of those who failed to turn up were from Kibwezi subcounty (34), Makindu (17), Nzaui (13), Kathonzweni (nine), Mbooni East (six), Mbooni West (five), Makueni (four) and three each from Mukaa and Kilungu subcounties. Maalim said pregnancies might be the cause for the high number of candidates missing the test in Kibwezi and Makindu subcounties. He said more than 500 teenagers fell pregnant in Kibwezi subcounty alone during the nine months of school closure that was occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic. The government will trace all candidates to know the reasons why they did not show up, the administrator said. He said headteachers and the Education ministry will trace the parents so they get answers. "We must trace them and account for them. Those are so many candidates. We will hold all parents accountable for their sons and daughters," Maalim said. He said three girls were forced to sit for their exams at different hospitals after they gave birth. Two girls from Mbooni were sitting the exam at Makueni County Referral Hospital while another from Kibwezi was tackling the test at Makindu Subcounty Hospital. There are 23 adult candidates including 21 males and two females doing the exam in Makueni, county adult continuity education officer Prisca Nduku said. "We have four centres set for our adult candidature across the county," she said. Eleven prisoners from Makueni Main Prison were also sitting the exam according to officer in charge Joshua Mutiso.
