Eric Omondi has asked parents to take the responsibility of parenting their own children. He said this following his arrest over the 'Wife Material' show. "Why would I be your child's role model? I don't even have a CV. How do you leave your child to me?" he told Amina Abdi. "Parents, please love me, laugh at my jokes, but do not leave your children for me to model and to parent." Omondi is set to resume his reality show in hopes of getting a wife from East African countries. "It is coming back bigger and better. It was to resume over the weekend but Tanzanians are mourning," he said. Adding, "It is not easy to find a wife." Omondi met with KFCB last week and promised to create clean content. "We are all in agreement that it doesn't have to be dirty to sell," he said at a press conference. "We will be avoiding obscenity."
