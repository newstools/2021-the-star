A judge has dismissed a case by the anti-graft agency questioning the academic qualifications of Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja saying it was lodged before the wrong forum. Justice James Makau said the constitutional court lacks jurisdiction to handle the matter. He noted that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission ought to have filed its case before an electoral court and not a constitutional court. The IEBC last month said it will smoke out those seeking elective posts with fake academic qualifications. The IEBC and Kenya National Qualification Authority officials said they willÂ partner to ensure only valid and genuine qualifications are used in the electoral process. The authority boasts of a database that will be a one-stop-shop for all genuine qualifications in the country. The database will contain information from all sectors on the education and training system, chairman KNQA Kilemi Mwiria said. Notable personalities in elective offices as high as those of governors have been embroiled in court battles over the eligibility of their academic papers. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission in November 2017 probed the eligibility of Meru Senator Mithika Linturi, a matter that saw the University of Nairobi revoke his law degree. In 2018, Kenyatta University also disowned the degree papers of Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said they are ready to work with the authority to eliminate academic fraud among aspirants.
