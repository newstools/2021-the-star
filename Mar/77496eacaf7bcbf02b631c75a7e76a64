The Aga Khan University Hospital has suspended the government-sponsored Covid-19 vaccination following the depletion of their stocks. The hospital said they will announce the resumption of the exercise once they receive more doses from the Ministry of Health. The hospital was administering the AstraZeneca vaccine. "We appreciate Kenyans for turning in large numbers for the free vaccination process," the hospital said. On Tuesday, the Ministry of Health said 1.12 million doses of Astrazeneca Vaccines have been delivered in the country as of March 30. 806,000 of those doses have been distributed countrywide while 130, 575 people have been vaccinated. Stories about people getting blood clots soon after taking the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine have become a source of anxiety. After a report on death and three hospitalisations in Norway, which found serious blood clotting in adults who had received the vaccine, Ireland has temporarily suspended the jab. Unlike the Oxford vaccine, the Sputnik V vaccine is being sold at a high price. According to an article published by Bloomberg, a single shot of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine costs Sh7,700, an amount that was confirmed by Nairobi-based lawyer Donald Kipkorir, who got an injection on Tuesday. “Sputnik V got high reviews from medical journals and that is comforting for me,” another lawyer, Ahmednasir Abdullahi, said by text message. “The West is hoarding vaccine it doesn’t need, but Russia has made it available to poor Third World countries like Kenya.”
