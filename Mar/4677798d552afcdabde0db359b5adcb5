The county government of Garissa has launched a Sh20 million canal rehabilitation project for irrigation farmers in Balambala and Jarajara. Presiding over the launch, county deputy secretary Roble Muhumed said that the project would serve 21 farms in Jarajara and Balambala wards and benefit over 15,000 residents. Roble said the project, which is part of the national governmentâ€™s Big Four agenda and Governor Ali Korane's manifesto, is meant to address food security and improve nutrition among area residents. The deputy secretary said the project under Kenya Climate Smart Agricultural programme will in the long run increase food productivity and resilience to climate change. "The project will have a big impact and will improve livelihoods among the local community," Roble said. The project scope entails canal excavation works at Debi intake, protection work with galvanized pipes, fencing of a 400m stretch from the intake, dyke construction at Omar Dalab Lake with gabions at spillway, inlets, and rehabilitation of Kulan and Farm B schemes. Roble assured the local community that the project will be complete within its intended time frame of six months. The Kenya Climate Smart Agricultural programme coordinator Bashir Muhumed called on the local community to support the project. Muhumed regretted that Jarajara and Balambala farmers known for the production of rice had to abandon the project because of water shortage caused by the shifting of the river course away from their farms. Community elders, youth, women representatives and area chiefs who spoke thanked the county government for the initiative and promised to fully support it. Edited by Henry Makori
