The decomposing body of a procurement officer at the Turbo National Youth Service (NYS) who went missing a week ago has been found. The officer went missing from his work station on Tuesday last week. His rotting body was discovered inside his house on Tuesday by colleagues. After five days of absence, the colleagues set out to search for him. Lugari subcounty police Commander Bernard Ngungu confirmed the incident. He said that Police have launched investigations to unravel the course of his death. His body was removed to the Kimbilio mortuary in the neighbouring Uasin Gishu county. Ngungu said that the deceased lived alone in his house. “He hadn’t reported for duty since Tuesday and nobody knew about his whereabouts,” said the police boss. Ngungu said that the deceased's colleagues broke a windowpane of his house only to discover his decomposing body lying on the floor. "They broke the door which was locked from inside to gain entry into the house where they found his decomposing body," he added.
