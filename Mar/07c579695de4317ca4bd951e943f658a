 City Hall is planning to build 12 new ECDC centres in the next financial year so more children are enrolled in early childhood learning. The enrolment has grown over the years to 25,411. The county wants it increased to 27,100 next year. In its 2021-22 budget, the county government has set aside Sh200 million for the construction of the facilities to improve learning. A 2019 education report showed Nairobi has 229 public Early Childhood Education centres. In 2018, the county scrapped all ECDE levies and launched a free pre-school programme. The ECDCs were to get Sh3,815 in capitation for each learner. The move was meant to ensure all children enjoy access to good elementary education. The programme was expected to increase enrolment from 15,295 to about 17,000 children by the close of that year. By April 2019, a total of 19,618 children had been enrolled. In 2019, the county banned ECDE graduation ceremonies in all public centres saying such celebrations were being used to fleece parents. Education executive Janet Ouko said the move was part of measures to ensure early childhood education was completely free. “We have noted with concern that schools are planning ECDE graduation ceremonies and charging parents between Sh1,000 and 1500. This is against the spirit of free ECDE which the county is implementing. We have therefore issued a ban on those ceremonies especially if they attract a charge to the parents,” Ouko said. City Hall also launched a free food programme where ECDC learners were given milk twice a week. The programme was sponsored at a cost of Sh22 million. Since then, enrolment has increased from 24,100 to 25,411. The county is planning to hire 520 more ECDC tutors this financial year. The recruitment of the teachers, 800 county constables and 1,200 firefighters have stalled three times. Lack of quorum in the county public service board was blamed. The board was fully constituted in October. City Hall has with time raised concerns over land grabbing of spaces meant for public schools and ECDCs. Ouko admitted that grabbing, especially of social hall land was a big challenge. Deputy Governor Anne Kananu has since put the grabbers on notice and promised to reclaim all grabbed public utilities. “We want to make sure all public land is well-utilised. If it is school land, let it serve its purpose,” she said.  Edited by P.O
