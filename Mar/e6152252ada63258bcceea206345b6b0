I am impressed by the measures that Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua announced on Monday to support the people of his county. Governor Mutua's economic stimulus package to cushion residents might look like a minuscule drop in the ocean but to the mwananchi on the ground, it will go a long way in supporting the people who live from hand to mouth. Mutua, for instance, issued a 100 per cent waiver on land rates and land arrears, reduced transport levy costs by 50 per cent, and non-payment of fees on vegetable vendors, boda boda operators, tuk tuk and Maruti operators. In addition, he waived fees on fire licence and land subdivision. He also removed wholesale and retail charges alongside parking fees and issued a 50 per cent waiver on single business permits. Mutua praised the management of Mulleys Supermarket, which is based in Machakos, for reducing prices on a number of food and non-food items making them affordable to residents. These are measures that will ensure the little small-scale businesspersons get from their sales go direct to their families. I am inspired to imagine how much of a difference it would make if all governors thought along the same line. It's leadership that goes out of it's way to reach out to private businesses such as Mulleys Supermarket to reduce prices of most consumer goods like flour that we want. It's being innovative, different and thinking without the box. It's commendable. I'm a firm believer that the true test of people comes during adversity and I applaud Governor Mutua for finding ways to support his people. Keep it up Mutua. I am confident that voters are watching.
