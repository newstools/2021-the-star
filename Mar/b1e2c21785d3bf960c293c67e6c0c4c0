Farmers have received 10,653 vouchers worth Sh68,127,700 for the purchase of fertiliser. Agriculture PS Hamadi Boga said 8,445 farmers have redeemed the vouchers. Under the e-voucher programme, 40 per cent is contributed by the government and a corresponding farmers contribution of Sh102.2 million. He said redeeming started in July 2020 with a budgetary allocation of Sh1 billion, which is targeting 100,000 farmers. The PS explained that under the system, farmers will receive a voucher from their county government to buy farm input such as fertiliser, seeds and pesticides from the nearest agrodealers. The agrodealers will later claim their payments from the government. In 2008, the government started the subsidised fertiliser programme to cushion farmers against high prices and improve productivity. However, over the years unscrupulous traders colluded with officials at the National Cereals and Produce Board to buy the subsidy fertiliser. They would then repackage it and then sell it back to farmers at a higher price. To weed out unscrupulous traders and help farmers access quality fertiliser, the Ministry of Agriculture in November 2018 proposed the use of e-vouchers. Farmers in Nyandarua county have received the biggest share, with 5,358 vouchers. Farmers contributed Sh54 million while the government contributed Sh36 million. In Elgeyo Marakwet, farmers have received 2,834 vouchers. Farmers contributed Sh32.1 million and the government Sh21.4 million. Uasin Gishu came third with farmers getting 1, 441 vouchers worth Sh19 million. Out of this, farmers contributed Sh11.5 million while the government gave out Sh7.6 million. Other counties that have also benefited include Embu, Kericho, Meru, Nyeri, Trans Nzoia, Nandi, Bungoma, Kisumu and Kirinyaga. The PS said the roll-out of the programme started with 2020 short rains, mainly in counties targeted for Irish potato, including Elgeyo Marakwet and Nyandarua. Boga said the ministry has been planning to increase the number of agrodealers involved in the process and that an advert in line with this was closed on January 29, 2021. “An evaluation report for the agrodealers who expressed interest is being compiled. We expect that the agrodealer catchment will be enhanced translating to better services to the beneficiaries,” he said. Boga said farmer registration exercise was conducted in January and February 2021 and 200,000 farmers out of the registered 230,862 are expected to be selected for the e-voucher benefits. “But this may not be the case due to the budget cut from Sh3 billion to Sh809 million. This will lead to a revision of the target from 200,000 to 50,000 farmers. The revision of targeted farmers from 200,000 to 50,000 may compromise efforts to improve food production," he said. “We will also have a challenge of accruing pending bills related to the just-concluded farmer registration exercise and contracted service providers which might result to court litigations.” The PS said the programme will be extended to 25 counties including maize growing areas of Migori, Laikipia, Narok, Nyamira, Bomet, West Pokot, Kisii, Vihiga, Kakamega, Taita Taveta and Kajiado. Busia, Siaya, Kwale for rice growing, Nakuru (Irish potato), Makueni, Kitui, Isiolo for green grams, sorghum growing areas of Wajir, Turkana and Homa Bay and coffee growing counties of Kiambu, Murang’a, Machakos and Tharaka Nithi.
