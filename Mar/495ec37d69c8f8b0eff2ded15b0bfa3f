748 Air Services will continue its scheduled flights to the Maasai Mara and charter requests for International Tourists via Wilson airport. This comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a cessation of all movement by road, train or air in and out of Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and Nakuru Counties until otherwise notified. The move was aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 in the country. KCAA has allowed international tourist flights to operate domestically after a previous deadline of Monday 29th March 2021. In a statement on Monday, the Air Services said it will fly all international tourists who have already booked to the Mara and welcomed all bookings from Camps and Lodges, Tour Operators and Travel Agents. "All local tourists who booked with us are not eligible for a refund however we will fly them at no additional costs, when the cessation of movement by air is lifted," the flight said. 748 Air Services is an Air Charter Company that holds an Air Operator Certificate and an imbedded Aircraft Maintenance Organization; both authorized by the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. Since its inception, 748 Air Services (K) Ltd has grown into one of the most reliable air charter companies in the region, catering to the humanitarian sector, natural resource sector and government institutions.
