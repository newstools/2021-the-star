 The United Democratic Alliance has lined up a series of activities to popularise the outfit with top officials exuding confidence it will be the party of choice in next year's general election. In an interview with the Star on Thursday, interim chairman Johnson Muthama said the party secretariat is consolidating plans to roll out mass recruitment ahead of grassroots elections scheduled for May and June. Slightly over 100,000 people have registered through the online registration portal which has been ongoing since January, Muthama said. The former Machakos senator said the party could have rolled out a number of activities were it not for the by-elections across the country. Five civic and two parliamentary by-elections were conducted on Thursday last week with another four scheduled for May 18. The Machakos senatorial by-election will be held on March 18. On Thursday, UDA won its first election in London ward in Nakuru county. “I want to thank Kenyans for they have already embraced UDA even before we officially launch it. We encourage all Kenyans who have been shopping for a democratic party to register so that they run for various offices and also participate in the elections,” Muthama said. He added, “Once we are done with the by-elections which have taken part of our calendar, we will be embarking on full activation of our party across the country. This is a party by Kenyans and for Kenyans.” UDA was formally registered in January by the Registrar of Political Parties after a successful name change from PDR. Its offices are located along Makindi Road, off Riara Road in Nairobi. It is widely expected to be the political vehicle for Deputy President William Ruto when he runs for president next year. UDA is a coalition partner in the ruling Jubilee Party and is believed to have been cleverly brought on board by Ruto in 2017 as a fallback plan.  Edited by P.O
