Kasipul MP Ong'ondo Were on Monday appeared before the National Cohesion and Integration Commission but declined to record a statement. The lawmaker said his summons were too general and had nothing specific on his alleged conduct during the just concluded Matungu by-elections. He said apart from the general invite he received from the commission, he was not served with any allegations as required by law. "I just received a general letter with no content. The letter was only quoting the powers of the commission," Were said. "They (NCIC investigators) said they have summoned me based on the reports from the media and social media sites, so I did not make any presentation and insisted that they summon me a fresh with the details of the accusations." The lawmaker also denied involvement in the Matungu chaos as was being alleged. The MP who was filmed being arrested last Friday claimed he was being evacuated from danger. "I was not arrested, the police were evacuating me because I was in danger. Why is it that I was not in court?" he posed. At the same time, nominated Senator Millicent Omanga denied involvement in the Kabuchai by-elections chaos saying the perpetrators were captured on television. The lawmaker on Monday said NCIC is engaged in kneejerk reactions in issuing summons. She added that she never received any letter summoning her and only turned up after seeing her name in the news. "There was no accusation levelled against me, they are actually seeking information from me. It was a knee jerk reactions by the Commission," Omanga said. The Commission is also expected to grill Feisal Bader (Msambweni), Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East) and Chris Wamalwa (Kiminini).
