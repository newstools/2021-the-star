Charges against a woman accused of violently robbing her online lover have been withdrawn. Eunice Waweru was charged with robbery with violence after she colluded with a gang to steal valuables from an online lover she had invited home. The 38-year-old however got a reprieve when the charges against her were dropped. Waweru was charged at a Makadara law court for robbing Dennis Ntabo of his Samsung phone worth Sh23,000, an ATM card, a silver ring and Sh5,000 cash in Kahawa West in Nairobi on May 18. She was also accused of transferring Sh15, 946 from his M-Pesa account jointly with others who were not in court. She denied the charges. The prosecution said Ntabo, 32-year-old DJ, was delivering electronics to a client in the area at about 6 pm. He thought he was unlikely to beat curfew and decided to contact his online girlfriend whom he had only met once in town. Wambui picked him on a boda boda and took him to her house. She said she lost her key. A friend arrived and as they waited four men arrived and accosted Ntabo, court papers said. They held him hostage at Wambui's house where they terrorised him overnight and robbed him, the court was told. They demanded he calls his friends and gets more money who sent him Sh20, 946. In the morning, the robbers took him to a bus station where they paid his fare. He reported the crime to the Kiambiu police station and led the officers to Wambui's house. She broke into tears when Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga said she would be released on an Sh500,000 bond. Wambui told the court she is poor and could not afford the amount. But on Thursday when the matter came up for hearing Ntabo filed an application to withdraw the case. He said that he had been paid the items and the money stolen during the said robbery. The accused had been remanded all that while as she had failed to raise the bond. Makadara chief magistrate Angelo Kithinji acquitted her.
