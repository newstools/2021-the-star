Kenya Electricity Generating Company PLC (KenGen) has bagged a gender award in recognition of its efforts to promote gender mainstreaming and women empowerment through its Pink Energy initiative. The award by the Government of Kenya, through the Ministry of Public Service and Gender, was presented to KenGen during a ceremony to mark the International Women’s Day (IWD) 2021 at the Kenya School of Government in Nairobi. KenGen Managing Director and CEO, Rebecca Miano, said the award was a welcome encouragement and would go a long way in motivating both KenGen and other organisations to embrace gender mainstreaming. She challenged women to rise above stereotypes, focus on building competence and be the best they could be by developing skills that would improve both their professional lives and position in society. “Women need to develop beyond technical skills and equip themselves with the capacity to work well with others, collaborate, develop partnerships and build relationships,” Miano, who is the founding Patron of the Pink Energy said. The KenGen Pink Energy initiative has achieved several milestones that include creating a conducive work environment for women, raising gender awareness, and helping institute gender mainstreaming across the company. The government, through the State Department for Gender, has established the Annual Trailblazer Awards and recognition programme that focuses on highlighting women’s contribution and exceptional effort through leadership, education, mentorship, service to communities and other areas. Pink Energy is a KenGen initiative to uplift the status of women within the company. It was launched in November 2016 and has gone a long way in creating change and enhancing the potential of women in the company. Pink Energy is anchored on three pillars: Personal development and empowerment; creating a conducive work environment and creating gender awareness.
