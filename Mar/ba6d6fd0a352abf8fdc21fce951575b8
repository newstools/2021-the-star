Director of Public Prosecutions, Nordin Haji, has denied ever going to Italy to investigate the Kimwarer and Arror Dams scandal. This is after former Treasury CS Henry Rotich asked the court to compel the DPP to supply him with the investigation report from Italy. Through lawyer Paul Ng'arua Rotich told CM Ogoti that he had not been supplied with the said report. Ng'arua said in 2019, the DPP and DCI issued a statement to the press saying they were going to Italy to investigate the Kimwarer-Arror scandal. "DPP has not disclosed to us their findings and notes of their investigations trip to Italy; he should disclose it," Ngarwa said. He further claimed the trip was made between July 1 and 20, 2019 and they have a right to get a report from that trip. State Lawyer Ali Taib said the DPP does not engage in investigations nor is he interested in investigations but his only role is to prosecute. The state also said it will call a total of 52 witnesses to testify against Rotich. They need 524 hours which translates to 3 months to complete the case if they will be heard daily. Ogoti was further told that the prosecution has also fully complied with the courts orders and disclosed all evidence to the defence. The prosecution also asked the court to provide a digital TV that they will use during the trial in displaying documents and evidence. They also opposed an application by the defence to supply physical documents to them rather than the digital ones that have been supplied. According to the prosecution, it will be risky to supply physical documents due to Covid-19 considering the voluminous documents in question. They have also asked for an Italian interpreter to interpret for the Italians charged in the case who are yet to be arrested. The court will give it's ruling on all the issues raised on April 23.
