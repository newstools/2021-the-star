Kilimo House which is housed in Agriculture ministry in Nairobi has been closed due to a rise in Covid-19 infections among staff. Agriculture CS Peter Munya in a notice on Tuesday, directed them to work from home. The staff should work from home until April 12. "During the closure we shall undergo fumigation exercise while instituting other Covid-19 safety measures," he said. Two days ago, the Public Service Commission said it will scale down its operations over the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. PSC secretary Simon Rotich said the commission will operate at 50 per cent capacity as half of the staff have been directed to work from home. This may affect services in many ways as most government employees work under PSC. Last week, president Uhuru Kenyatta issued new directives on Covid-19 but forgot to cushion Kenyans of its effect. In his directives, Uhuru locked down five counties that he said were infested by the disease. However, he did not give Kenyans relief like he did the first time when he announced a lockdown. The President had issued a tax relief for Kenyans last year something that he did not do during his address. This has made a Pastor blame the president for the mess that Kenyans are witnessing.
