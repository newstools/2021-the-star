Fast-rising star Gabiro Mtu Necessary has dropped his latest single, 'Isabella'. Over this soundtrack, Mtu Necessary reflects on his village love interest Isabella, who gets an opportunity to go and work in the city. Shot in the lakeside city of Kisumu, Isabella gives us a clear picture of how our ambitions can hinder us from loving the ones we choose. Speaking to Word Is, he said hip hop inspired him to persevere and self-educate himself. 'When I was going through it, the thing that held me down was an old computer at my uncle’s place, where I stored thousands of downloaded beats," he said. "That’s why I’m so loyal to the cause and loyal to the culture. I feel like I owe it to hip hop to do the best I can."
