"The IG warns the leaders that we shall not tolerate such misconduct and that stern action will be taken against them. The IG has instructed police commanders of jurisdictions where by-elections were carried out to arraign and charge the four leaders who were arrested," the statement said. According to Owino, IG Mutyambai has also instructed the Firearm Licensing Board to suspend licenses held by the said politicians over misuse. "The affected individuals are hereby instructed to surrender their firearms to DCI headquarters with immediate effect for ballistic examination," he said.
