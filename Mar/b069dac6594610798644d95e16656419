Champions KCB will be looking to inflict more misery on Quins when the two sides clash at the RFUEA  ground tomorrow. The bankers started their season  strongly,  edging out Strathmore  Leos 27-16 in a topsy-turvy duel while Quins lost 38-13 to Menengai Oilers. KCB assistant  coach Dennis Mwanja expects a competitive match against the Ngong Road outfit. "This will be a tough match. Quins are coming from a loss and will want to prove a point. We were not at our best against Strathmore though we won so it will be a tough game and the boys will be ready,” added Mwanja. The visitors will rely on Kenya Sevens' skipper Andrew Amonde, internationals, Curtis Lilako, Oliver Mangeni, Davis Chenge and Griffin Musila in the pack. Samuel  Asati and Shaban Ahmed will play-half back, pairing with Isaac Njoroge, Peter Kilonzo and Geoffrey Okwach, the stars in the backs. On their part, Quins who lost their season opener 39-13 against Menengai Oilers last weekend, will be seeking solace in playing at home. Captain Elisha Koronya, Dan Suchi and Hillary Baraza will lead the onslaught in the forwards with Dominic Osino, Evin Asena, Pius Shiundu and David Ambuya the key actors in the backline. Quins Head coach Antoine Plasman says the players must minimise errors both in attack and defence following the heavy defeat against Oilers last weekend" We played well in the first half but we had lapses of concentration in the second and this week in training we have rectified the mistakes and we hope to have a good game agaisnt KCB who are semi professional outfit" he added At the same venue, Blak Blad will entertain Oilers in a match slated for  1pm. Strathmore Leos entertain Kabras at home.  The students gave KCB a run for their money before running out of steam to lose while the sugar millers thrashed  Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology 56-0. The students have a date with Nakuru RFC at the latter's backyard at the Nakuru Athletic Club.
