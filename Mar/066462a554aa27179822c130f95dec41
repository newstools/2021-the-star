President Uhuru Kenyatta has revoked all issued curfew passes and exemptions. "This is in light of the abuse of curfew passes and exemptions and its role in the steep increase in infections," Uhuru said. Addressing the nation on Friday, Uhuru ordered the Ministry of Interior jointly with the Ministry of Health to immediately review the protocols for re-issuance of curfew passes and exemptions. "In that regard, in the intervening period all passes issued are hereby vacated," he said. Uhuru further said that all physical/In-person and congregational worship in all places of worship in the Counties of Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and Nakuru stands suspended until otherwise notified. Following the sharp increase in Covid -19 ceases in the country, the President ordered all hospitals to limit the number of visitors for hospitalized patients to two visitors per patient. This comes as hospitals report inadequacy of space for patients and beds for critical cases.
