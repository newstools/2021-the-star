Afropop superstar Mr Eazi has released his new EP, 'Something Else'. It follows a busy year for the Nigerian recording artiste and music business innovator. Mr Eazi added that he spent the entire 2020 working on building emPawa Africa and morphing into ‘Don Eazi’, the mogul. “I almost had no time to record. This project was inspired by Kel P and Killertunes, who kept coming to meet me until I finally recorded ‘The Don’. That opened the door for me getting back in the studio.” He said lead single 'The Don' is a dramatic, opera-inspired slice of afro trap. ‘E Be Mad’ is a love song dedicated to everyone in a long relationship wanting to take it further.” The EP's lone guest feature (on 'Cherry') comes from Kenya’s Xenia Manasseh, one of 30 emerging artistes handpicked by Eazi to participate in the #emPawa30 talent incubator.
