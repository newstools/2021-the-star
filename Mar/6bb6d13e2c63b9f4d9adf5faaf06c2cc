ODM party leader Raila Odinga has tested negative for Covid-19. The party confirmed via Twitter on Wednesday that Raila is now out of danger of the virus and is focused on pending issues. He tested positive for the virus on March 11 when he checked into Nairobi Hospital  for a series of tests after complaining of fatigue when he returned from a grueling five-day tour of the Coast region where he had drummed up support for the Building Bridges Initiative. Raila met with party officials on Wednesday to discuss recent developments in the country including the on going countrywide vaccination and the state of the country's economy. He reaffirmed ODM's commitment to the spirit of the Handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta as well as the Constitution Amendment Bill, 2020 which is a product of  the BBI. " In the spirit of handshake and the wider goals of the BBI Amendment Bill, we agreed on the need for parliament to fast track the process and release the document to the public," Raila said. The BBI process has been thrown into disarray following Uhuru’s directive suspending parliamentary sittings and in-person meeting. The President, in heightened measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, suspended until further notice, sittings of the National Assembly, the Senate and county assemblies. The speakers of Parliament and county assemblies are expected to enforce the decision. Ordinary sessions of the county assemblies of Nairobi, Machakos, Kajiado, Kiambu and Nakuru were also suspended until further notice.
