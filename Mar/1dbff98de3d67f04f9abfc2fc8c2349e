Mother Nature sometimes is in a bad mood and it helps to keep an eye on what is happening to the sky. Technology has allowed us to be able to tell the weather of the day through applications on our devices. When testing weather apps, one spends more time evaluating the effectiveness of their design and an ideal weather app is visually pleasing and easy to use. 1Weather is one of the best weather apps you can use to tell you the weather of the day. It features a simple, paginated design that shows you the current weather, a forecast of up to 12 weeks and a radar. Just like other weather apps, its radar map is with plenty of layers you can toggle on and off. As most people prefer to get their weather information from handy widgets, this app has widgets to spare and it comes preloaded with six widgets of varying shapes and sizes. WeatherBug is another weather application that has a unique lightning detection service, a lot of weather information and live cameras. Spark is this app’s lightning detection feature that is deeply integrated into the Android app. When you tap on Spark, it will pull up the Spark Map and you will see lightning bolt icons appearing at the location of lightning strikes around the world. Spark also tells you the distance from the nearest lightning strike and gives you advice on what to do in your area. The Now page on this app has seven customisable shortcuts to tonight’s forecast, 10-day forecast, user-submitted photos, the news heavy Spotlight section, live cameras showing weather conditions, Spark lightning-detection system and pollen levels. You can access weather information for different locations either from the dropdown menu at the top of the screen or by tapping the map pin. You can also set a custom location for the app’s widget along with a custom background or text color.
