A matatu driver accused of abusing a female pedestrian and attempting to attack her with a panga was on Monday charged at a Nairobi court with creating a disturbance. Martin Njoroge appeared before Milimani Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku where he is accused of causing a breach of peace to Rael Cheruto on Sunday. According to a police report, Njoroge was speeding behind the Nation Centre building in the CBD and almost hit Cheruto who was walking. Cheruto then asked him why he wanted to knock her down to which Njoroge responded by saying "Enda ukatairi wewe malaya wewe". He then took a panga and grabbed the complainant and threatened to cut her up. It is security guards at Ibrahim's Supermarket who rescued her and took the panga from the accused. Njoroge was later arrested and taken to Central Police Station. Njoroge denied the charges and pleaded for lenient bond terms. He was released on a cash bail of Sh10,000 or bond of Sh25,000. The case will be mentioned on March 15.
