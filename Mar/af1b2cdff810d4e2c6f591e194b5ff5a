Politicians will always go for what is good for them. This means that you cannot write off anything. President Uhuru Kenyatta is a politician and he will go for what suits him best. Again, politics is a game of dynamics. Things are never static. They keep changing and evolving. New things keep coming up and they define new thinking. Decisions are therefore made on the basis of what is going on and the interests of the politicians. How best can they be served. For example, Uhuru will have to weigh how badly he needs to determine his successor come 2022. How badly he needs to do that will determine how far he is likely to go or the sacrifice he is likely to make. Uhuru has already sacrificed Deputy President William Ruto. He can as well sacrifice ODM leader Raila Odinga. However, he will always do that with serious calculations. Now that he has sacrificed Ruto, would he want to do the same to Raila? To do that, Uhuru would want to know whether he is prepared to deal with the possibility of the two teaming up together to attack him. He must make proper calculations and cannot just make a blind move. Uhuru is not a fool, he is a seasoned politician. Uhuru knows that if he has decided not to work with Ruto, he has already burnt those bridges. Does he really want to do the same with Raila? Picture this; Uhuru is in the house, and Ruto is outside, can he really kick Raila out? Will he really want the two of them outside? The President will not have peace in that house with both Raila and Ruto outside. People who are saying Uhuru is going to betray Raila the way he has with Ruto are unrealistic. Remember that Raila once fought Uhuru and Ruto and gave them nightmares. If Raila is kicked out, he would possibly join Ruto. Can Uhuru then win the elections with Musalia Mudavadi and Gideon Moi?
