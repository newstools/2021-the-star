A man believed to have killed a 51-year-old bodaboda operator during a robbery that occurred two days ago within Kisumu's Kasagam area has been arrested. Fredrick Kivaji alias Asman was arrested, when the matatu he was using to escape was circulated and intercepted within Mumias township. DCI boss George Kinoti said on Tuesday they received a report of a male body dumped at a cassava plantation in the Guba area, with deep cuts on the head. The man whose life had been callously curtailed was identified as Tom Mboya Ayoo. His motorcycle-KMFJ 763Z-was also missing and suspected to have been stolen by his assailants in the March 28 incident. "Detectives from DCI Kondele launched a hunt for the perpetrators, whom they suspected to have escaped to Koyonzo area," Kinoti said. Kinoti said after a day, detectives learnt that the missing bike had been fixed with a tracking device. Acting on those leads, they established further that the gadget had been disabled within Namalasire village in Mumias East. Led by the deputy in-charge DCI Kondele, the investigating team initiated a door to door search, bumping into the bike at a house under construction. A teen found within the compound gave details of the suspect who had brought in the motorcycle, hiding it in a room where a bloodstained iron bar and a sharp knife were also found. As the body undergoes autopsy at a Kisumu morgue, the suspect is being processed for arraignment with further investigations ongoing.
