The counties were put under the cessation of movement indefinitely. "These countries are declared a disease infected area," he said during a press conference on Friday. "There shall be a cessation of movement into and out of the infected areas." He also announced that all international travels will continue but under strict guidelines. Uhuru said all travellers in and out of Kenya shall comply with the guidelines on Foreign and international travel. He added that all persons coming in and out of the country must be in possession of a Covid-19 PCR certificate acquired no more than 96 hour prior to arrival.
