Fifty seven people who flouted Covid-19 regulations including curfew were arrested and detained at Kilimani Police Station, Nairobi before being released on Community Service order. They are expected to report to the directorate at 8:00 am to 5:00 pm for the entire week for their services including clean up of Marikiti and Muthurua Markets, Globe Roundabout, along Nairobi River and as will be assigned. The culprits were found drinking at a bar on Marsabit Plaza along Ngong Road past midnight on Saturday and Sunday. Kilimani police boss Vitalis Otieno warned they will arrest and arraign anyone who flout the rules as part of efforts to contain the spread of the pandemic. “This will be a new trend now. You will be held and committed to community service if you are flouting the rules,” he said. A Kibera court ruled the Nairobi Metropolitan Service through the Directorate of Enforcement will oversee their services at various facilities, streets in Nairobi. The court ordered that National Police Service will re-arrest and arraign in court those who do not abide for a stiffer punishment, a court ruled in a new move aimed at taming further such practices. The police boss said they have enhanced operations targeting various joints that are flouting the rules by allowing revelers to drink alcohol past curfew hours. The victims started their work on Monday afternoon cleaning various public places. They were seen cleaning Uhuru Park armed with brooms. The government has imposed various rules to contain the spread of the pandemic. Enforcement has however been a challenge. The spread of the disease has overwhelmed the health care system in the country. Kenya had by Monday recorded a total of 122,040 cases after 1,130 people tested positive from a sample size of 5,119. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said the test positivity rate from the cases stood at 22 percent and is the highest this year as Nairobi County accounted for 730 of the new infections.
