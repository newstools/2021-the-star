Uasin Gishu county government plans to build cycling paths and footpaths along the highways within Eldoret town to promote the cycling as a sport and a means of and healthy living. Speaking during the launch of Mama Cycling, a cycling initiative started by Rachel Ruto, wife to Deputy President William Ruto, governor Jackson Mandago said the county government will partner with cyclists to sensitise the public on healthy living and mitigate effects of climate change. "When we embrace cycling and walking, we shall be reducing our medical problems by a very big margin. We shall be undertaking fitness in the event and thereby reducing our visits to hospital," Mandago said. Mandago added that cycling will also be integrated into various programs of the county government to ensure they attain their objective of 10 per cent forest cover. "As the human race, if we are not going to change the way we do things, then mother nature will be very unforgiving and will begin to respond ruthlessly. The effects of climate change and unpredictable rainfall patterns are now affecting food production," he said. Present during the launch was Mrs Ruto who was was among the cyclists who cycled 60km around Eldoret in a cycling exercise to popularise the initiative. Mrs. Ruto applauded Mandago's government for the footpaths, saying it promotes a culture of exercising through walking.
