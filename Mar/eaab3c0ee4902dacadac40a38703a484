Reigning Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia have appointed former goalkeeper Jerim Onyango as their new keeper trainer to replace Willis Ochieng who rendered his resignation yesterday. Onyango who doubles up as the Kenya U20 keeper trainer returns to the side he left behind in 2017 after a lengthy service both as captain and first choice custodian. Upon his retirement, the club handed him a new role as the youth team head coach. He is expected to fit in the shoes of Ochieng who announced his departure on Friday citing personal reasons and an accrued 14-month salary the club owes him. “Please accept this formal notice of my resignation from the position of Goalkeeper Coach/Trainer with immediate effect,” Ochieng’ said. “I am thankful to you and the club management for giving me the opportunity to work with the team for the last four and a half years during which I have thoroughly enjoyed coaching some of the most talented keepers that have graced Kenyan football. “However after consultation with my family. I have come to the painful decision that it is time for me to move on to the next challenge due to personal and family reasons.” While at it, Ochieng reminded the club they owed him some wages too and urged them to act promptly. “On another note, I wish to bring to your attention that the club owes me salary arrears for a total of 14 months. I would be most grateful if the club could settle these or let me know how soon the arrears will be settled.
