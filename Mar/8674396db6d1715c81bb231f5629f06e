Sauti Sol, through their weekly reality show, Sol Family, have narrated the day Bien and his sister were involved in an accident in town. Savara said he was in Nakuru and was informed that Bien had been in an accident. "I get there and I am like, what the hell?" Bien lost his teeth and got his knees knocked. "I was with my sister, we were crossing the road in town then a car was driving on the wrong side. The car came and crushed my knees and my face hit the windscreen." Bien jokingly said his teeth are international. "That is why I have teeth from Germany. The Mercedes Benz of teeth." Savara also mentioned that they planned to go abroad. He was going to study medicine, Bien was going to the States and Chimano, his dream was to live in Paris. Chimano said Bien's accident probably brought them together. Bien believes the accident was a blessing in disguise. "When I look at it, it was a good moment. I got better teeth because the ones I had were bad na zilikua zinachoma, but look at me now." Sol Family reality show Season 2 was unveiled two weeks ago and will run for 20 episodes. The reality show is available on Showmax. Producer Eugene Mbugua said Season 2 is exciting because everyone is a bit used to the camera now. "We try to get away from the dramas that are associated with a reality TV show. We are walking away from reality TV shows' toxicity."
