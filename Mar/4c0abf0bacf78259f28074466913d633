Phase One of the Masinde Muliro Stadium in Bungoma County is on course as the construction works at the Sh765 million facility enters its final stages. The stadium, which was initially referred to as Sudi Stadium, was constructed in the early 50's during the colonial era and had since deteriorated into a sorry state. Football Kenya Federation (FKF) delegation led by NEC member, Tony Kweya conducted an inspection of the facility and were happy with the progress. “We are working with the Bungoma County government to ensure the facility meets all the Fifa and Caf requirements. We are pleased with the progress of Phase One , which has taken almost one year,” said Kweya. Phase One includes the main stand, VVIP, VIP, four dressing rooms, parking and a stand of about 5000 people. Once complete, the stadium will accommodate about 20,000 people and will be able to host both Caf and Fifa matches. Bungoma has produced great sportsmen and women including the late Ben Jipcho, a silver medallist in 3000m steeplechase at the Munich Olympics in 1972 and celebrated volleyballer Dorcas Ndasaba among others. Bungoma CECM in charge of sports, Madam Everlyne Kakai, thanked the federation’s good gesture of working closely with the county to ensure the progress of the work is in line with both Fifa and Caf requirements. “This is one of the flagship projects in Governor Wycliffe Wangamati’s leadership and he is very keen to make a mark by empowering the youths, who are the backbone of the sporting industry. This will also open up other avenues that will spur the growth of development in the western region," she said.  The facility is expected to be ready by mid next year.
