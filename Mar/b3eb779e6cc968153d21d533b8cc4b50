@ppcheti Lamu county is trying to revive the fishing sector, which has dwindled due to the ban on night fishing and the Covid-19 pandemic. Fishermen are quitting in large numbers, also citing frustrations from security officers while at sea, the lack of a common market and poor infrastructure. Fishing is a major income earner for Lamu county and more than 6,000 families are directly dependent on it for survival. Key fishing hubs include Kizingitini, Faza, Pate, Mkokoni, Kiwayu, Ndau, Kiunga, Ishakani, Lamu Island, Shella, Matondoni and Kipungani. Due to the threat of al Shabaab terrorists, night fishing has been banned, though night is the most productive fishing time. Speaking in Lamu island on Wednesday, county fisheries officer Simon Komu said the department had launched a special management plan to help fishermen. He said the department has advertising online to link up local fishermen with international markets. The export business will improve, he said. “With the Blue Economy initiative in place, we intend to empower and encourage fishermen to undertake entrepreneurial fishing so the sector attains international recognition and generally grows the economy," Komu said. The lack of modern fishing gear and infrastructure has also crippled the sector. Komu said the department plans to  purchase more sophisticated vessels and equipment for deep sea fishing. A few months back, the county government announced plans to reclaim and improve fish landing sites. Lamu has more than 40 landing sites in all fishing hubs in the region. Most landing sites have been grabbed by individuals, however, meaning fishermen have no holding location for their catch.  (Edited by V. Graham)
