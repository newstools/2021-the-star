The Building Bridges Initiative is turning out to be a do-or-die affair for lawmakers, even those in areas where the drive never had much popular support. So high are the stakes that the politicians, especially those who had campaigned against the document, are going the distance to convince their voters that they are in support of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga-led initiative. A Tangatanga lawmaker from Central got this baptism by fire and was only released after apologising to the locals for opposing the BBI and hurling unprintable words against the promoters. He even knelt on the ground to make his mea culpas. A witness appearing virtually before a parliamentary (Parliament pictured) committee was 'forced' to abruptly exit the meeting. Reason? The man, a senior state official — who was long-winded, to say the least — was angered by the chairman's constant reminder that he should summarise his presentation. He just didn't grasp the beauty and effectiveness of brevity and probably thought his every word was a gem. The chair kept insisting that the members were running out of time and that he should hasten his submission. Apparently offended, the official asked why the committee invited him when the members were in a hurry and couldn't hear him out. He immediately exited the Zoom platform. A lawmaker representing an expansive constituency in one of the Western counties is now taking advantage of his electoral unit to play three gubernatorial aspirants who are banking on him to bag the vote-rich subcounty in the coming elections. The second-term lawmaker is said to be making unrealistic demands from the three hopefuls in exchange of his support. Corridors of Power has  learnt that the trio has spent a fortune on the man whose lifestyle has improved dramatically in recent months. His aides are now wondering how long the game will continue.
