Residents of Nduma village in Kikuyu constituency, Kiambu, held a protest march on Monday evening after a speeding school van hit four pupils, killing one girl. The pupils from Nduma Primary were walking home from school when the driver of the Ken Academy van lost control of his vehicle and hit four pupils. Business came to a standstill as residents screamed and blocked the road with twigs and stones. A boy and a girl, who are in Grade Two, were treated at Kenyatta National Hospital and discharged. The fourth pupil and the school van driver suffered serious injuries and were admitted at KNH. A resident, Andrew Ng'ang'a, who is a boda boda rider, said the van hit the children and veered into a nearby farm. "We were attracted by other pupils who started screaming on witnessing the accident. We came running since we had heard a loud bang. People were so angry," Ng'ang'a said. Residents have threatened to hold another protest before the end of this week, asking MP Kimani Ichung'wa and the Kenya Rural Roads Authority to erect bumps in the area. Traffic police officers from Kikuyu police station arrived and fired tear-gas after their efforts to calm residents who were protesting failed. The girl's body was taken to Kikuyu Hospital mortuary while the wreckage of the van was towed to Kikuyu police station. Two weeks ago, a boda boda rider and his passenger died on the spot on the same road after colliding head on with a vehicle at the same scene. Bishop James Njenga says the area needs to be cleansed with prayers, even as the government embarks on erecting bumps. Edited by Henry Makori
