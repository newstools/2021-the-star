Singer Tanasha Donna has advised her fans against making time for people who do not deserve it. In a post on Instagram, the mother of one shared four major life lessons that she has learnt. "Stop making time for people who don’t deserve a second of it," she wrote. "Can’t cross oceans for people who wouldn’t even jump a puddle for you. Outgrow the idea of helping people who are not the least bit concerned about your physical or mental well being." This is not the first time she has spoken her mind on how she believes situations should be handled. After her breakup with Diamond, Tanasha warned women against dating narcissists. She urged people to protect their souls and pray hard because dealing with narcissists is like dealing with the devil himself. "Sometimes it takes experience and realization to learn, pray hard Every day!! 5 times a day if possible. Because dealing with a narcissist is like dealing with the devil himself. Protect your soul."
