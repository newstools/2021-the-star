A Ugandan househelp was arrested by detectives on Saturday for assaulting and seriously injuring the children of her Nairobi employer who had sacked her. DCI sources say the woman in her 20s had checked herself into a Busia-bound bus to flee the city, hoping to cross the border into Uganda to escape arrest. Police arrested her in Eldoret with two Kenyan identification cards. According to a social media post by the DCI on Saturday, the househelp had disagreed with her city-based employer and was sacked. She waited until the employer left the house, sneaked back and beat up the children, inflicting injuries. "Instead of taking her marching orders kindly after the sack, she stealthily crept back to her employerâ€™s residence in her absence and assaulted her children, ostensibly to get back at her," the post read. The two children, boys aged five and 11, are in critical condition with stab wounds and other injuries. At the bedside of a city hospital where the two children are being treated, the employer, alongside other women recorded a video pleading for help from the public to trace the nanny.
