The acting head of inspectorate at the Kisumu County Government Willy Lugusa has resigned following an incident in which the local askaris assaulted and dragged a female hawker on the road in a bizarre drama. Lugusa tendered his resignation in a letter to governor Anyang’ Nyongo dated March 26. The incident happened on March 24 and Lugusa has termed it unsociable, diabolical and against the rules of natural justice. “I hereby take full responsibility for the acts committed thereto. I hereby extend my deepest regret to all the people of Kisumu County and the nation as a whole for this is not what the county government of Kisumu represents,” he said in the letter. Lugusa is a former police commander and had served various positions before he retired as a senior officer. Nine askaris suspected to have been behind the assault were arraigned at the Kisumu Law Courts on Friday where they denied the charges and freed on Sh50,000 cash bail each. They were arraigned with assaulting a city trader they had arrested for hawking oranges and lemons in the Central Business District. The officials, who were captured on camera dragging Beatrice Magolo tarmac road last Wednesday, were arrested after the video went viral eliciting an angry reaction from the public. The woman was filmed hanging behind a speeding county pickup, with her lower limbs on the tarmac. Behind in pursuit were boda boda riders who were hooting in protest of the act. The Governor stated all County enforcement officers must carry out their duties while fully respecting the human rights of wananchi.
