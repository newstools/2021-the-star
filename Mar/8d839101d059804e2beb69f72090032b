Four journalists were injured during a scuffle involving Langata MP Nixon Korir and supporters of different candidates in the London Ward By-election in Nakuru. The MP allied to the United Democratic Alliance had gone to Mlimani Polling Station apparently to monitor voting when supporters of other candidates in the race forcefully ejected him. A clash between supporters of different candidates ensued with the people engaging in running battles, fist-fights and throwing stones. Police had to lob teargas to disperse the fighting camps as Korir’s car sped off almost running over Citizen reporter, Evans Asiba who was covering the incident. Asiba ducked to avoid Korir’s car as a section of supporters tried to snatch his camera. The Mediamax crew suffered various injuries on the head and upper body after the supporters pelted them with stones. Kameme’s Regina Wangui was hit with a stone on the chest while Emoo FM’s Elijah Cherutich was hit on the head, chest and back. Cherutich lost his Media Council of Kenya press card during the melee. K24 Television’s Kigotho Mwangi was also hit by a tear gas canister as the police tried to control the crowd. IEBC Returning Officer, Silas Rotich said they had to stop the exercise at Milimani Polling Station for about 20 minutes for the air to clear. He said operations later resumed and urged residents to continue going to the polling stations to vote. On Wednesday, a near scuffle was experienced at Jarika Hotel in Nakuru Town West where UDA proponents were holding a meeting. Police disrupted the meeting on allegations that they were planning violence during today’s by-election in London Ward.
