The Kenya Forest Service has over 40 million tree seedlings set to be planted during the anticipated long rains. Chief Conservator Julius Kamau on Wednesday said their nurseries had 40 million as of end of February. "This will change as we have more than that in private nurseries," he added. There could be more than 100 million seedlings in total. "We have an online platform for private nurseries to register and we will work with Kenya Forest Research Institute to certify them so that our partners can buy seeds from them," Kamau said. Statistics from the KFS show that the service has 9,180,211 exotic trees, 3,786,281 indigenous, 23,004 bamboos, 90,223  fruit trees, and 407,668 mangroves. Institutions have 1,735,965 exotic, 521,632 indigenous, 17,674 bamboos, 350,354 fruit trees and 49, 874 mangroves. Community Forest Associations together with TMAs have 459,992 exotic, 344,198  indigenous, 13,490 bamboos,  13,906 fruit trees, and 75,000 mangroves. Private nurseries have 17,892,741 seedlings, 5,356,880 indigenous , 291, 648 bamboo, 1,461,282 fruit trees, and 266,967 mangroves. This brings the total number of seedlings ready to be planted to 42,338,990. Kamau urged Kenyans to take advantage and grow trees. He said trees have particularly helped during the Covid-19 pandemic period as they provide healthy spaces for Kenyans to connect with nature for self-reflection, recreation, and healing. The government has been urging Kenyans to plant trees in their private land as one way of tapping the potential of forestry in private and community land and increase forest cover. Under a draft forest policy 2020, the government says it cannot achieve 10 per cent cover by only focusing on gazetted forests on public land managed by Kenya Forest Service. "To get to the 10 per cent forest cover, public land is not sufficient. This calls for incentive measures to get private and community landowners to establish forests on their land," the policy reads. KFS is the national agency responsible for the conservation and management of public forests. It manages 6.4 million acres and helps counties manage 4.2 million acres. KFS says at least 988,422 acres of public forests under the service are degraded and need to be fixed. The state has been prevailing upon Kenyans to plant trees on 10 per cent of their land as one way of increasing the shrinking forest cover. Agriculture CS is empowered by the Agriculture Act to institute rules that prohibit, regulate, and control the clearing of land to promote soil and water conservation and prevent the destruction of vegetation. The 2010 Constitution classifies forests into three categories—public, community, and private. The draft policy says Kenya's forest cover is 7.4 per cent, a far cry from the constitutional requirement of 10 per cent. Public include all forests on public land; forestland lawfully held, used, or occupied by any state organ; forestland transferred to the state by way of sale, reversion, or surrender and forestland in respect of which no individual or community ownership can be established by any legal process. The national and county governments are responsible for all forests on public land. The government has committed to increasing the cover to 10 per cent by 2022, a move that needs Sh48 billion. Some two billion trees will be planted. The draft policy says agroforestry and farm forestry has taken root in the country and trees outside forests contribute to increased tree and forest cover as well as enhanced ecosystem services while supplying the demand for wood. "This calls for cooperation and collaboration between different landowners and synergy between land ownership and land use. At present tree cover on farms is increasing, especially in more densely populated areas with higher agricultural potential." The policy says given the growing population, it is not possible to meet all the demands of forest products from state forests and the main alternative source of these products is private and community lands. Demand for wood products has hit 45 million cubic metres against a supply of 30 million. Forests help to stabilise the climate.  They regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods, and help drive sustainable growth. An analysis of demand and supply of wood products by the Environment ministry in 2013 showed that Kenya had a wood supply potential of 31.4 million cubic metres against a national demand of 41.7 million cubic metres. This left a deficit of 10.3 million cubic meters. The study showed that timber, poles, firewood, and charcoal supply stood at 7,363,414 cubic metres, 3,028,907 cubic metres, 13,654,022 cubic metres, and 7,358,717 cubic metres respectively. The demand for timber, poles, firewood and charcoal stood at 5,262,624 cubic metres, 3, 1,409,482 cubic metres, 18,702,748 cubic metres and 16,325,810 cubic metres respectively. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
