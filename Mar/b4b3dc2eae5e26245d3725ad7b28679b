Kisii Governor James Ongwae has advised residents to strictly adhere to Covid protocols, noting that the third wave is serious. Ongwae said it would not be right for them to wait to be reminded of what they should do, calling for personal and collective responsibility. “I am urging our people to take responsibility because the third Covid wave will not spare anybody. They should understand that life is precious,” Ongwae told the Star by phone. The county boss at the same time urged all Kenyans to respect President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directives, saying they are well-intended. “We understand that the President's directive will have an impact on the economy, but there is nothing we can do since the same is aimed at curbing the spread of the pandemic,” he said. “It is disgusting that some of our people have gone back to their normal ways of life despite frequent warnings.” Combating the disease requires self-discipline and residents should not take any warning for granted, he said. He expressed concern that some can people disregard simple directives like that of wearing face masks and social-distancing. Health experts have been raising concerns about increasing Covid cases in the country, blaming the same on violation of safety measures. “The rising of cases can squarely be blamed on citizens dropping their guard and rising noncompliance with wearing of facemasks, sanitising and social distancing,” Ongwae said. He, however, added that he was impressed with the manner KCSE examination is being conducted, commending administrators for taking health protocols seriously. “I wish all Form 4 candidates the best as they tackle their examination for the second day. I am happy that all the safety protocols have been taken into account.” Ongwae expressed optimism that both KCPE and KCSE candidates will perform well. He said despite the Covid challenges, his administration is committed to serving residents, with development being top on his agenda.
