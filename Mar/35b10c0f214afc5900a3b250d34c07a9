Proof of how far West Ham United have come in 12 months is that manager David Moyes was disappointed with his side’s performance in a 2-0 win over Leeds United that sent them into fifth place in the Premier League on Monday. First-half goals by Jesse Lingard and Craig Dawson secured the points for West Ham who are now two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea with a game in hand. Leeds twice had two goals disallowed before West Ham scored and captain Declan Rice said they had “won ugly”. Moyes agreed that it was not the best performance, although he was understandably delighted with the way his side ground out an eighth league win since the turn of the year. “We were resilient, we didn’t play well tonight,” Moyes, who helped West Ham avoid relegation last season after replacing Manuel Pellegrini, said. “Not a good performance by our standards. The players are disappointed. “Leeds United do a lot to you and make it difficult to play. We had a bit of control but I didn’t enjoy it.” West Ham had moved into the top four last month before a defeat by Manchester City and Moyes said the prospect of vying for a Champions League berth was a huge carrot. “When you get near the top it gives you a big incentive,” Moyes said. “I was gutted when we dropped out the top four. “We are doing really well and having a good season. It could be a great season. I’m not saying we will finish (in the top four) but we need to hang in and see what we can do.” West Ham’s best finish since returning to the top flight in 2012 is seventh in 2016, while the last time they finished in the top four in the top flight was in 1986.
