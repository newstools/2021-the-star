Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said the third wave of Coronavirus pandemic which has not spared top leaders is not good for Kenyans. Ojaamong on Friday said the Governors fully supported the measures put by President Uhuru Kenyatta to contain the spread. "We have to bear with tough measures put up by the Government, lest the country will be plunged into turmoil should the pandemic reach unbearable levels," he said. Ojaamong revealed that ICU beds are full to capacity in Kenya with none available to accommodate an additional person who may have breathing challenges. Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said Covid-19 is still a major threat, thus the need by county residents to continue observing Ministry of Health protocol. Kakamega Catholic Diocese and Bungoma Diocese administrator Bishop Joseph Obanyi offered prayers for the quick recovery of ODM leader Raila Odinga who is admitted at Nairobi hospital after conducting Covid-19. Bishop Obanyi said the Conference of Catholic Bishops met on Thursday where it gave the Covid-19 vaccine that has been rolled in Kenya a clean bill of health. "There is nothing wrong with the vaccine and neither is it a sin to receive the jab. If you opt not to take the jab is also your choice so long as you don't jeopardize the lives of others," he said. Bungoma Governor, Wycliffe Wangamati who attended the burial enumerated his long journey with Ojaamong, urging county residents to consider him for any position he may opt for.
