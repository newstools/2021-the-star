Local-based players in the men's national basketball team, Morans, will resume training in a fortnight to prepare for the FIBA AfroBasket Championships slated for August 24-September 4 in Kigali, Rwanda. They will be training under the guidance of assistant coach Sadat Gaya as coach Liz Mills takes a break until May to visit her family in Australia. "She will leave behind the programme to be followed by other coaches, organise zoom meetings and advice accordingly. With technology, nothing is impossible. We will be trying out every player and will only pick the best in each and every position," Kenya Basketball Federation chair Paul Otula said. Otula announced plans for an extended training camp and friendly matches to ensure the country selects the best talent to fly the national flag in Kigali. "We will cast our net wide to get good players for this assignment. We have a pool of 30 players both here and broad to choose from," he said. The chairman further encouraged players who did not make the squad for the recent FIBA-AfroBasket qualifiers in Yaounde to continue working hard to improve their chances of selection into the final squad. "Our local based players have remained positive even after being dropped from the final twelve and I urge them to keep working hard as always as the door is still open," Otula said. He added that Kenyans out there who are playing in very competitive leagues are in touch and KBF have requested for the clips before inviting then for the final trials.
