'Crime and Justice' film has tapped Patricia Kihoro, Melvin Alusa, Serah Ndanu and Angie Mwandanda in its latest episode that is now streaming on Showmax. Titled 'Battered', this episode takes a break from the court battles and instead focuses on domestic violence. Kihoro plays Tina, a woman stuck in an abusive marriage to a high-ranking detective, Peter, played by Alusa. A mother of two who’s never without a bruise on her body, Tina is caught between wanting to protect her young children and staying together as a family. Speaking about her role, Kihoro says getting into this role meant shedding a lot of herself and tapping into an experience that she knows is real for women. “That it is commonplace for women to be trapped in such marriages is gut-wrenching. I would see her come through in some of my real relationships off the set,” she said. "Physically, I chose to stop grooming myself for a while because Tina herself didn’t have time to – my nails were chipped, and my hair wasn’t styled. Mentally, I would sometimes tap into my insecurities to strip Tina of any confidence." For Alusa, who plays Tina’s violent husband Peter, it was difficult to step into a role that required him to expose kids to such violence, being a father himself. “I have a lot of compassion for kids. I believe in keeping adult problems between adults and not exposing children to the trauma that comes with such conflicts.” 'Battered' is directed by the multi-award-winning Supa Modo director Likarion Wainaina. Other stars include Serah Ndanu, Angie Mwandanda, Neville Misati and Chris Kamau. Crime and Justice episode 5, 'Battered', is available on Showmax. New episodes air every Monday.
