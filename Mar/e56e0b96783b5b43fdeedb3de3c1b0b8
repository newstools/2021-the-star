Mwingi Level 4 medical superintendent Dr Evans Mumo has urged Mwingi residents to turn up and get the Covid-19 vaccine. Speaking in his office, Mumo said only 192 persons have turned up for the jab after the exercise kicked off on March 22. "We are encouraging teachers to come and receive the jab for their own safety," said Mumo. He noted that though many teachers may be held up in invigilating KCSE exams, those free should visit the hospital to be vaccinated against the virus. Mumo also lauded security officers saying their turn out was high. "All level 4 hospitals in Kitui are offering the jab, but in the larger Mwingi, the level 4 facility is the main vaccination centre," he said. The facility received 1,000 doses for the first phase but by Tuesday, only 192 persons had been vaccinated. He also urged residents to observe the set precautionary measures even after getting the jab. The medic also said Mwingi is recording high numbers of Covid-19 as 23 persons out of 122 tested in the last two weeks have tested positive for the virus. The facility conducts tests using the rapid antigen test but does not do mass testing, only persons with Covid-19 signs and after contact tracing is done. Selina Amina, who is a nurse in Mwingi and received the vaccination said it is not very painful and urged resident to show up. "The injection is not very painful and I have decided to get it to protect myself and the people around me," she said. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
