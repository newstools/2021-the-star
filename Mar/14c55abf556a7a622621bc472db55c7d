The CoG said more than 8,000 public and private health facilities across all 47 counties that have immunisation sites are expected to be hubs for the vaccination programme by 2023. “One of the challenges is slow uptake by health care workers owing to social media information on the side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine (blood clots) as well as global misinformation of the vaccine,” the CoG told the Senate Health Committee on Thursday. So far, 2,937 health care workers have been trained on Covid-19 vaccine roll out for phase 1. The submission said the following side effects have been reported by health workers: pain/swelling at the injection site, muscle pain, headache, low grade fever, facial swelling, generalised body malaise, nausea and loose stool, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, dizziness and itchiness, fatigue and night sweats. Kagwe said it was too early to talk about vaccine acceptability, adding that several weeks are needed for assessment. “These are the first days of distribution, it is difficult to tell about acceptability when the roll-out is just starting. We have been doing about 2,000 per day but we are rising to 4,000,” he said. The country is feeling the effects of the Covid-19 third wave described as aggressive and potentially lethal. The positivity rate is above 15 per cent, the number of admissions has increased and so has home-based care for asymptomatic cases. The Health task force chaired by Dr Eva Njenga has been charged with identifying isolation facilities that can be quickly turned into Intensive Care Units. With most ICU beds full, counties have been also been charged with  ensuring isolation facilities are ready, complete with piped oxygen, to prepare for a possible surge in numbers. “When you look at the first two waves, the necessity for ICU facilities did not rise as high as in this third wave. Therefore, we need to prepare more ICU facilities at each county,” Kagwe said. The ministry has now revised its vaccination plan to include the clergy, people aged above 60 years and those with comorbid conditions. It emerged that many deaths were in older people and those with underlying conditions. Clergy in contact with many people also are vulnerable.  (Edited by V. Graham)
