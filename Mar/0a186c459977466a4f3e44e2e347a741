A drug abuse disorders management expert has expressed concern over widespread bhang consumption in Embu primary schools and advised enhancement of the fight against it. Psychiatrist Dr Njagi Kumantha said there is a need for complete change of the policy in management of bhang smoking in Kenya in order to deal with a serious problem that awaits the country if the current trend continues. Dr Kumantha, who is a former Mathare Mental Hospital’s director, said on phone that smoking bhang is one of the causes of mental illness or induced psychosis and that when a user develops the disorder, one cannot distinguish it from Schizophrenia. He said the government needs a change of policy on the management of abuse of bhang starting all the way from cultivation, importation, selling and the use of the substances and establishment of rehabilitation centres. He called on leaders and parents to be in the forefront in fighting against drugs  in schools. Dr Kumantha said what is happening in schools represents what is happening in the general community, adding that people must change their attitude towards bhang smoking and recognise it as a narcotic and an illegal drug whose possession and use is punishable by law. He attributed the rampant burning of schools to consumption of bhang which worsen the mental status of the consumer and because they wouldn’t like to suffer alone, they burn schools so that everybody can be sent home. Dr Kumantha said in the past, there were reports of the government carrying out massive destruction of bhang plantations in forests and other farms and ambush of bhang selling hideouts but today such reports are not there as there is a lot of laxity. He was reacting to reports of pupils in Embu county being caught smoking bang with some being arrested with it. The most recent incident was in Kibugu primary school in Embu North sub-county where two learners were caught with the drugs -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
