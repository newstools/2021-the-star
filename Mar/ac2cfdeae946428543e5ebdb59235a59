Inspector-General of police Hillary Mutyambai and Interior PS Karanja Kibicho were the first to receive the Covid-19 jab on Wednesday when the government started police officers vaccination. Both officials were vaccinated by Lucy Kanja Immunisation specialist during the roll out of the Covid vaccination to the police service unit at the Police service HQ Nairobi. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe officially rolled out the process which began with healthcare workers on Friday last week. "As I indicated, we have a priority list with regards to the vaccination which initially started with our healthcare workers to be followed starting today by teachers, security personnel and other vulnerable groups. The police officers will start the process of vaccination today starting with the IG," Kagwe said.
