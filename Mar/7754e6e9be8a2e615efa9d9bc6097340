Brian Ndung'u Waititu was accused of driving a Toyota Probox on Muindi Mbingu Street under the influence on Monday at 1.30am. He was accused of being under the alcohol influence to an extent of being incapable of controlling the vehicle. While admitting to the offence before senior principal magistrate Esther Kimilu, Brian pleaded for leniency, saying that he is a first time offender. "Your honour I plead for leniency before this court and I will not repeat the offence," Brian told court. The magistrate considered his mitigation and fined him of Sh30,000 or he serve three months in default.
