A woman is counting losses after arsonists raided her home in Kokoth Kataa, Homa Bay, and torched her animal pen, killing 10 goats. Jenifer Odhiambo said the attackers invaded the home early morning while they were asleep and set ablaze the structure using petrol and tyres. She said they were awakened by the commotion from the burning goats and the smell of petrol. Odhiambo requested the government to move with speed and apprehend the culprits. “I’m requesting the government to protect my life since I have been attacked three times but no arrests have been made so far,” she said. Chief Michael Owino said they were still investigating the incident. “We are still carrying out investigations into the matter and we are following up crucial leads,” he said. Owino urged members of the public to share with authorities any information that may lead to the arrest of the culprits. Edited by A.N
