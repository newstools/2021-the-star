Former National Transport and Safety Agency boss Francis Meja on Sunday said Tanzania broke the spirit of good neighbourliness by arresting 26 Kenyans last week. “Kenyans living along the Kenya/Tanzania border have relatives on both sides of the two countries and therefore have a right move freely,” Meja said. Meja, who has also announced he will be seeking the governorship in Kajiado next year, said there is a lack of understanding between Kenya and Tanzania, adding that the Maasai from Tanzania has been coming to sell their livestock in Bissil town without passports. “What has become of our Kenyans who have been crossing the Rombo border to buy food in Tanzania since time immemorial?” asked Meja. He spoke a day after Governor Joseph Lenku crossed over to Tanzania to pay a court fine of 1 million shillings for the 26 Kenyans, who were mostly women. After they were released by the Tanzanian authorities, they crossed over into Kenya through the Illasit border town. Lenku shaded tears of joy after the women were released. He said the Tanzanian jailers refused to allow lactating women to take in their children for the four days they were behind bars. “This is inhuman. You cannot treat people that way. These are not criminals but people who have been crossing over to Tanzania to buy food items for many years. Tanzanians are working in farms in Loitokitok, and we do not ask for their credentials because we value our neighbours,” Lenku said on Sunday.
