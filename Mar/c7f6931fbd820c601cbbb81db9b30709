A Nairobi resident has moved to court challenging the irregular transfer of public land by Nairobi County Government to Lapfund. In a case filed in court, George Ochieng wants the court to restrain the county from transferring possession of Mariakani Estate pending hearing and determination of the application. "The honourable court should issue orders restraining the respondents from interfering with the residents' possession of the estate known as Mariakani Estate No. 209/6612 pending hearing of the application," reads court documents. Ochieng claims that on August 8, 2012, Nairobi County reached an agreement with Lapfund where it relinquished and transferred several properties in the name of the then City Council of Nairobi to Lapfund. "The Nairobi County agreed to relinquish and transfer sever properties to Lapfund in order to offset statutory debts owed by them," Ochieng claims. Ochieng argues that the said transfer was irregular and illegal because at the time there was a moratorium order from the Transition Authority stopping such a transfer pursuant to the law. He further avers that the tenants of the estate are apprehensive that Lapfund might evict them since they claim to be the owners of the property. "There is imminent fear that Lapfund will eventually forcefully evict the tenants of the estate which is a travesty of their social and economic rights under the Constitution," reads court documents. Ochieng says the whole process by the city county was not subjected to public participation.
