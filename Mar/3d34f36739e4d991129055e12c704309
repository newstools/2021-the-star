Christian died on Saturday at Downtown Los Angeles Hospital in the US with his twin brother Lovy Longomba by his side. Lovy wrote on social media,Â "To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. I love you, Christian, my brother, my friend and partner, but Jesus loves you more. Enjoy Heaven. "Christian was well-loved and we celebrate his gifts and talents that he shared with the entire world. With great love and appreciation for the support and love shown to Christian by fans, family and friends, we kindly ask for privacy during this time. God bless you all, Longomba family." Christian was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2015.
