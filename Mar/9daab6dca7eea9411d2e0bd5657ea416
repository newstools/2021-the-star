Betting firm SportPesa will begin supporting community health and livelihoods projects as part of its corporate social responsibility. SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri said their foundation aims at touching the lives of the people through provision of necessary support in health. “It is important to empower our communities, and as SportPesa we are playing our part in supporting this particularly towards building an inclusive community where our people find the much-needed services without any challenge,” he said. Speaking when he donated beds and drip stands to Ndarawetta dispensary in Bomet Central on Tuesday, Karauri also expressed his commitment to supporting maternal health to ensure women do not have to travel long distances to get better health care. The company also donated Sh800,000 towards construction of a kitchen at the facility. The company recently launched maternal health support, an initiative geared at ensuring challenges faced by women in seeking the needed health services in the existing health facilities are addressed to reduce morbidity and mortality. Through the initiative, the organisation strives to work closely with the national, county governments and other partners in various counties to support maternal health. “If we partner with counties and even the national government, we are sure challenges facing our people will be tackled,” said the CEO who was accompanied by Nairobi Lands and Housing executive Charles Kerich. SportPesa has been sponsoring and supporting football teams through provision of playing kits and other materials. During the event, the firm also distributed playing kits to more than 50 football teams across the subcounty. Kerich lauded the company for the support saying: “Women across the country continue to suffer complications due to scarcity of well-equipped maternity facilities, and this is an investment which means an increased capacity by the facility to handle more deliveries.” -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
