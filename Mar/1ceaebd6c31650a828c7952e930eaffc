Mike Kirimi won the Britam Golf Series at the Nyeri Golf Club over the weekend. The event, sponsored by Britam Holdings to the tune of Sh9 million, saw Kirimi vanquish a strong field of amateur golfers. Kirimi, a member of Nanyuki Sports Club, carded a solid 45 stableford points to lift the overall title. On the outward nine, Kirimi set off on a birdie hunting spree, managing a single birdie, five pars and three bogeys for a first nine score of 22 points. On the course’s toughest hole, stroke index-one 13th, a par-four, he made an easy par after he found the green on three and holed out a 14-foot left-to-right downhill putt. He then bogeyed the 14th hole, a par-four. “I had unfinished business with the Nyeri course after I failed to win during Monday Blues Golf Day. That made me up my game and also resolved to play better with a score of 40-plus points if I was to finish on the podium,” Kirimi said. Handicap 20, C Wanjau was men’s winner with 36 points while Sam Muchiri of Nanyuki took the men’s prize second on 35 points. In the ladies category, Nyeri Club Lady vice-captain, Regina Mumero (H26) claimed the bragging rights on a score of 40 points as Rose Komu (H26) took ladies runners up prize on 37. Dr. Njuguna won the first nine with 21 points with Eddie Karumwa claiming the second on a similar score. In the commercials, Charles Wanjau won the men’s longest drive as Kaititia Tekenet took the ladies’ category. The event attracted 90 golfers including some single handicap golfers.
