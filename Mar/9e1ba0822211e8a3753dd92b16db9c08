Residents of Gatundu North subcounty in Kiambu are excited after the tarmacking of a 15km crucial road started. The road is being constructed by the government through the Kenya Rural Roads Authority at a cost of Sh800 million. Once complete, the Mang’u-Bob Harris-Ndarugu road will link up Thika Superhighway with the Nairobi-Nakuru Highway through Juja and Gatundu North constituencies. MP Wanjiku Kibe said the road is expected to be completed in early 2022. The legislator spoke to journalists on Mang’u on Wednesday while inspecting its progress. The legislator said the 15km road is part of 100km set to be tarmacked by the government in Gatundu North constituency. She said after improving the road to bitumen standards, drainage will be constructed and street lights erected to boost security. Kibe said the project will bring to an end the suffering residents of Mutuma and Kirai villages have endured for decades due to the deplorable state of the road. “This road is used by thousands of residents who have been suffering due to its poor state. It is a crucial road since motorists can easily travel from Thika Superhighway to the Nairobi-Nakuru Highway in a short time,” she said. Wanjiku said the road will open up the region for investments, boost trade and spur the region’s economy. “Most of Gatundu North residents are farmers and once the road is complete they will be able to conveniently take their produce to markets in Thika and Nairobi. Land and estates along the road will attract real estate developers,” she said. Wanjiku called on the contractor to ensure that 30 per cent of the jobs are given to residents. Residents welcomed the project, saying it is godsend and will boost the region’s economy significantly. “God has answered our prayers that the road has been tarmacked. It will ease transport and bring more development to our villages. Also, this project will make land prices skyrocket and the value for our land to appreciate,” resident Anne Njeri said.
