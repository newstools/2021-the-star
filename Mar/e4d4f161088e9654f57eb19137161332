The Kisumu government dropped a supplier that had sold it a surgical mask at Sh35 and went for one that quoted Sh56. Auditor General Nancy Gathungu revealed this in her report on a special audit on the utilisation of Covid-19 funds that also laid bare massive irregularities in the management of the funds. The report shows that on September 27, 2020, the county government awarded a tender to Darcindy’s Enterprises for the supply of 1,000 packets of 50 pieces of masks at a cost of Sh2, 800 per packet. “An approved professional opinion was issued on September 9, 2020, by the head of supply chain management and approved by the fund administrator confirming the award at Sh2.80 million,” reads the report in part. Earlier in June, a different firm, HELA Intimates EPZ Ltd, had supplied similar items – disposable three-ply surgical masks – at Sh35 per piece, making it Sh1,750 per pack of 50. “It was noted that the county government of Kisumu purchased disposable masks at a higher price in September than in June when the demand was higher and therefore cost expected to be higher owing to the emerging threat of the Covid-19 pandemic,” reads the report. Consequently, the county incurred a loss of Sh1.05 million in the procurement of the masks from Darcidny’s Enterprises. According to the report, Kisumu county received a total of Sh238.57 million for Covid-19 related activities with Sh103.00 million already spent by July 31, 2020. The amount received included Sh159.82 million grant from the national government, Sh7.7 million from Danida, Sh68 million from the government for health workers allowances and Sh50 million county own source revenue. The report also put Governor Anyang Nyongo’s administration on the spot for delaying the release of Sh7.70 million Danida funds to various health facilities thus exposing the money to value for money risks. According to the bilateral grant financing agreement signed by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the national treasury, funds related to the Universal Health Coverage were to be disbursed on the county allocation of revenue act, 2018. It also states that the semi-annual disbursement through the national treasury to qualifying county treasuries through Ifmis for subsequent transfers to levels 2 and 3 facilities should be done within 15 days. However, while the county received the cash from Danida on June 30, 2020, it disbursed it to its 106 facilities on October 5 and 8, 2020. “This was beyond the 10 working days and later than the 13 August 2020 deadline required for disbursement,” reads reports in part. Further, the auditor has blamed Kisumu for failing to utilise Sh930,000 meant for frontline health workers’ allowances. Kisumu officials also did not disclose Covid-19 items donated by partners to aid in the fight against the virus sparking fears the items could not have benefitted the residents. This is contrary to the county government  Section 74 (4) of the Public Finance Management Act Regulations, 2015. The provision states that where grants and donations are received in kind, the value of donations shall be determined and included in the estimate and reflected as expenditure in the financial year.
