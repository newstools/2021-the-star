Kabuchai parliamentary by-election candidates have raised concerns about a decision by the IEBC to move its tallying centre to a private facility. Nalondo Secondary School has traditionally been the tallying centre for constituency polls. But a private teachers training college in Sikusi will be the new tallying centre. IEBC constituency coordinator Benson Isuza said they are still waiting for its gazettement. He said there was no cause for alarm. “We looked for alternative tallying venues but our predicament was that most of the schools were in session and students doing exams and this is the only option we managed," he said. However, candidates Gasper Wafubwa (independent), Evans Kakai (UDA), Amos Wekesa (Federal Party) and David Kibiti (Green Movement Party) expressed their reservations, saying the relocation is suspect. “Why should the IEBC move a tallying centre to private facility, which also doubles as a private home of a person? The place is very small and insecure and we will not accept it," Kakai said. Wafubwa said the IEBC is being influenced by a particular candidate from Sikusi area where tallying will now be done. “Why are they moving the tallying centre from traditional places that are also government facilities?” he asked. Wafubwa demanded that the tallying centre be returned to either Museses headquarters or Nalondo Secondary where they have always been. Kibiti shared similar concerns, saying the decision will compromise the security of other candidates and their agents. “How do you assure us the safety of aspirants and their agents in a place that is a private home?” he asked. Polls coordinator Isuza, however, said they consulted candidates but they couldn’t reach a consensus. “It is very difficult to have consensus of a tallying centre among aspirants. Some will support while others will oppose,” he said.
