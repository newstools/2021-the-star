Three major police commands in Nairobi have new bosses in changes announced by Vigilance House. This follows recent promotions effected by the National Police Service Commission. They also come in the wake of renewed operations to enforce Covid-19 rules especially on social joints that are deemed super spreaders. More than 100 subcounty police commanders were affected in the changes announced on Tuesday. John Nyamu is the new Central OCPD, William Kahindi (Nyamache), Samson Thuranira (Gucha South), Dorothy Mugarisha (Juja), Anderson Njagi (Isinya), Andrew Muturi (Kilimani), Timon Odongo (Makadara), Peter Nyaga (Kasarani), James Ngetich (Kisumu Central), Mohamed Guyo (Thika West) and Stephen Kirui (Lari). Several county commanders were confirmed to their positions. The new Kisii county commander is Patrick Macharia while Robinson Mboloi will be the deputy regional police commander in Rift Valley. Vihiga police command will now have Benjamin Ong'ombe as the boss after the newly posted Benjamin Onsongo diedÂ  of Covid-19 complications on Monday before reporting. The new Kajiado county police commander is Muthuri Mwongera, Beatrice Kiraguri (Nakuru) and Geofrey Mayek (deputy regional Eastern). There has been concern over enforcement of the Covid-19 pandemic rules with some officers being accused of leniency. For instance in Nairobi, top commanders have had to circulate a list of bars that are said to be notorious for flouting the rules to prompt operations from local officers. At the weekend, police from Kilimani raided a bar along Ngong Road, which is in Dagorreti command, and arrested 57 revelers. Those arrested were produced in court and committed to community service for a week. Edited by Henry Makori
