Railway Club golfer Samuel Njoroge made was the only Kenyan to make a cut as the magical Kenya Open entered halfway stage at the Karen Country Club course. Njoroge, who turned pro in last year in October,  made it to the money bracket 2 under par 140. He played a round of 3 under yesterday. Njoroge said: "The first thing about today is that I was relaxed, more than yesterday. It was my second day and I knew the course better than yesterday so I said, today I have to play well. "Then on seven, I lost my ball, and then on hole 14, I lost a ball again, but I recovered very well.Those two holes were bothering me but hopefully tomorrow I’ll do well on those holes. "I’ve prepared well and I want to play better than today and make my country proud, my sponsors and myself."
