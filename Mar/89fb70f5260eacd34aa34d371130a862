Students from Mount Kenya University have been enrolled for a two-week Diamond Trust Bank’s job shadowing programme. Other universities whose students will benefit from the programme include Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, University of Nairobi, Management University of Africa and Strathmore Business School. DTB head of human resource Lilian Ngala said the programme will give students an opportunity to learn what is expected of them in the job market. The students started with a comprehensive one-day orientation at DTB’s head office on Mombasa Road and were thereafter posted to various branches and departments of the bank. “We aim at providing the students, both continuing and graduates, with an opportunity to learn by observing our employees perform their duties. The programme is important in helping the graduates get hands-on skills,” Ngala said. She said the programme will bridge the gap between the theory students get in schools and the practical experience in the job world. MKU Centre for Professional Development director Dr Christopher Mutembei praised the bank for incorporating the university’s students in the programme. “It is an opportunity that will make them qualified professionals and competitive in the global job market,” he said. Mutembei said the university is also training youths from Kiambu county on diverse skills after the institution was given an approval by the Kenya Youth Employment and Opportunities Project.
