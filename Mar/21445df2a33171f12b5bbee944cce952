Health workers have been warned against charging for the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. During a press briefing on Wednesday at Afya House, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi made it clear that the vaccine is free. "The AstraZeneca vaccine that is available in all public health facilities is there for free, there is no cost to that vaccine. The vaccine is available for free in the facilities and this includes private facilities as well," she said. She also warned health workers that if found charging for vaccination, their licenses can be withdrawn, also pointing out that some people are bribing to skip lines when it comes to receiving the vaccine. "We have reports where people are bribing to skip lines. Healthcare workers who are attending to these people, we want to alert you and have you recognize that your license can be withdrawn because of that very act," she said. The Ministry of Health has also warned against marketing of the Sputnik V vaccine, saying it has only received emergency use authorization, not marketing authorization. This comes as a section of private hospitals have been marketing the vaccine which is being administered for between Sh7,000 and Sh11,000. Sputnik V vaccine has been imported by a private organization and the Russian embassy has said the firm should take responsibility for any challenges associated. On Covid-19 cases, Kenya has on Wednesday recorded 1,412 new covid-19 cases, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said. This was from a sample size of 9,219. This now brings the total number of cases to 134,058.
