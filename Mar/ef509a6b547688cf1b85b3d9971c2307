Two men killed in Mathare on Sunday night were shot multiple times at close range and died of blood loss. The police report at City Mortuary said the two were shot dead at a robbery-with-violence scene in Kiboko area in Pangani. OCPD Alice Kimeli declined to comment.. A postmortem examination performed at City Mortuary on Wednesday showed Oscar Otieno, 24, and Peter Kuloba, 27, were shot a number of times at point blank range. Otieno’s father Philip Ongati said he was informed of his son’s killing at around 10am on Monday. “Witnesses told me he was inside a night club in Mathare when a row ensued with other people in the club,” he told the Star. Ongati said the club owner, a woman well known to residents, locked them inside and called police. Officers were on patrol in the area. He said that when the officers arrived, they ordered the group out of the club. They singled out his son Otieno and Kuloba and took them away, the father said. “The next day, residents found the two bodies a few meters from the club before police arrived to pick them,” Otieno’s father said. Ongati said Otieno had only just returned from their village in Homa Bay, a day before his death. “I know a certain woman in the area had falsely informed on him to the police because she holds a grudge against him. That is why they were singled out,” he said. Kuloba is said to be a Ugandan staying in Kenya but the family with whom he stayed in Kampla, Mathere, declined comment. Social justice working groups on Twitter said the two were killed by police for breaking the 10pm curfew rule. (Edited by V. Graham)
