Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has urged counties to expand their ICU facilities as Covid-19 cases rise. "We are urging our hospitals to quickly expand their ICU facilities. We have asked the county task force to identify areas we can convert to isolation facilities," he said on Wednesday. This comes as 1,297 new cases were reported from a sample size of 7,450. He also pointed out that counties will likely have to take care of their patients because Nairobi county is already dealing with a large number. "Moving forward, it is likely counties will have to take care of patients at county level," Kagwe said. The CS reminded the public that, "The virus doesn't understand we are tired." "We are asking for cooperation and responsible behaviour in the fight against COVID-19. I urge Kenyans to be determined to fight this wave. This is not the time to tire but to invigorate our determination so we do not fall on the wayside," Kagwe said. From today's cases, the youngest is a two-month-old baby while the oldest is 97 years old. 280 patients have recovered from the disease. But on a sad note, the country has lost 12 patients to Covid-19.
