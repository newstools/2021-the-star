The High Court has temporarily stopped the hearing of the two cases against former Governor Sonko in Kiambu and Kamiti courts. Justice Weldon Korir said Sonko had established that his prosecution by the state subsequent to his comments in a political rally held on January 2021 did not accord him the constitutional requirements. "From the applicants pleadings I sense a threat to the right to freedom of conscience, religion, belief and opinion under Article 32," Korir ruled. The court has said such threats and violations point to the commencement of a disease that must be firmly and authoritatively nipped in the bud. Sonko moved to the High Court seeking to stop his prosecution, saying it was unconstitutional and a violation of his rights. It is not evident from the pleadings before this court that there were active investigations prior to Sonko’s supposed speech but immediately after that, state machinery was deployed to arrest and prosecute him with various offences. “I am therefore satisfied that there is apparent and imminent threat to his constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms which must be stopped at its inception,” Korir ruled. The court also noted that the state did not respond to Sonko’s claim that he was arrested and prosecuted as a result of the some statement he made in a public rally. According to the court, this is a strong averment that needed a response from the state but none was forthcoming so to the court, that averment hold strue at this point in time. The two cases are assault and terrorism.
