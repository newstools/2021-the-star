Five people drowned in Lake Victoria on Saturday evening when a boat capsized near Arongo beach in Seme, Kisumu. South West Seme acting chief Shadrach Ochola said the vessel tilted as one passenger took a selfie. His movement prompted the boat to capsize. None of the eight people on-board had a lifesaver jacket. "The boat lost balance in the process," he said. Of the eight, six were Nairobi residents who had travelled upcountry on Friday for a burial ceremony in the location.  Three people, including the coxswain, survived but were taken to Manywanda Hospital for treatment. Three bodies were retrieved by divers and fishermen and taken to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary in Kisumu.Â The search for the other two resumed on Sunday morning. "We are using the fishing gear to try to fish out the remaining bodies. The nets have been cast around the area where the boat capsized, about 200 metres from the shoreline," Ochola said.
