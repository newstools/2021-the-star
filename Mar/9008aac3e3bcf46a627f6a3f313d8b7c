Eldoret Falcons have appealed to stakeholders in the football fraternity to help  rescue the team that is on the verge of  disbandment due to  financial difficulties . Falcons are struggling financially and they are unable to sustain their players at the moment. Already the team has given a walkover against Oserian and are rooted at the foot of the Zone B table with zero points after eight matches. With lack of motivation, the team is staring at the possibility of playing in the Division One league next season. Falcons chairman Joshua Ariko said he has been using his resources to fund  the players but his sources have also dried up. "Funds are our biggest challenge. I have already talked to football stakeholders within Eldoret but nothing is forthcoming. If we don't get sponsors on board, we will have no option but to dissolve the team," he said. He added: "I have used my personal resources to help the team achieve their target and I am also financially drained. We have had a few well wishers who have come in handy but that support is not enough," ariko said. Falcons are known for nurturing young players who have ended up donning the national team colours. Ruth Ingosi and Annet Kundu all starred for Harambee Starlets in Cecafa women's Championships in 2019 before heading to Cyprus. Falcons are currently rebuilding and have only four senior players. Ariko tipped more players to follow in the footsteps of the aforementioned players and test themselves abroad. "We have a very talented pool of players and if they can be nurtured well, they have a chance to play for Harambee Starlets. And who knows? they might even head to big leagues in Europe." "But our poor results is because of inexperience and luck has not been on our side. We've conceded last minute goals which have denied us the opportunity to get our first points of the season."
