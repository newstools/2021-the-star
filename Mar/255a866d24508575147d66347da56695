SportPesa Chief Executive Officer, Captain Ronald Karauri brought plenty of smiles and a symbol of hope as he attended a round of matches in the Wazee Pamoja League on Sunday at Camp Toyoyo Grounds. What would ordinarily be just another match-day in the blistering hot sun was spiced up by a surprise as the leading African gaming platform donated Sh870,000 in a newly-formed sponsorship deal. Wazee Pamoja League, as they are known today, comprises of 11 teams whose players are over 33 years old and play throughout the year in a competitive league. “I’m very happy to be back here at Camp Toyoyo. It has been a while and it is befitting that the day I returned was for such a great cause. “I have seen so many players here, some of whom have played in the Kenya Premier League in the past and need to be taken care of as well,” Captain Karauri stated. There are many former professional players who have found a home in the league, with the likes of former Tusker FC and Kenya international Osborne Monday, whose Cruz FC were 3-1 winners in an entertaining match against Tipples FC. “The league is very important as it keeps the Wazee active and helps them remain as key figures in the community. That is why we saw it as a perfect start for SportPesa as we return to continue our endeavor to develop football in the country,” he added. Wazee Pamoja League Governing Council chairman Bernard Miruka led the entire fraternity in thanking SportPesa for choosing to partner and support them as well as for the generous donation. “This league has been going on for 14 years and we have never had a sponsor. It has always been money from our own pockets that has sustained us. “I’m very happy that as we enter our 15th year, we have finally gotten sponsors who are ready to help us ensure the league flows seamlessly,” Miruka explained.
