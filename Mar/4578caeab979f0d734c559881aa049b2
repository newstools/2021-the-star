A woman has been arrested by police in Kikuyu town in Kiambu for allegedly spiking a drink with a drug and robbing a man of thousands of shillings. Judy Njambi had gone out with the complainant who was buying her drinks in a bar in Kikuyu town on February 29. Detectives said she waited for the complainant to go to the urinals and she poisoned his drink. He took the drink and became confused. Kikuyu subcounty police commander Michael Mwaura said Njambi took the complainant's mobile phone and convinced him to tell him his M-Pesa PIN number. Mwaura said Njambi transferred Sh184,000 to her phone and later borrowed Sh600,000 from the complainant’s Equity Bank account. She abandoned the complainant in the bar. “When the case was reported, we recorded statements from bar operators and the CCTV footage of that day was reviewed where the lady was seen,” he said. On Saturday, drama unfolded in the same bar when the suspect arrived and the management called police who pounced on her. “All those who wrote statements including the complainant came and identified the lady,” the police boss said. But Njambi denied poisoning the man and urged police to investigate properly. She was locked up at the station. Edited by Henry Makori
