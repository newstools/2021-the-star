Wetlands MP Tim Wanyonyi is suited to be Bungoma governor, his Sirisia counterpart John Waluke has said. Speaking in Sirisia, Waluke said Bungoma county was facing a serious leadership crisis and it was important that sons of the soil like Wanyonyi come back home  for its rescue. “Bungoma is being run very badly with wanton corruption and slow development, only a person with foresight like Wanyonyi can rescue our home county ,” said Waluke. He said Wanyonyi had shown exemplary leadership while serving his two terms as the Member of Parliament for Westlands and he should now be elevated to a senior position. “He has proved that he can serve in the capacity of governor very well. We are going to mobilise all leaders in this region to ensure that they support him,” he said. The lawmaker further said there was no need for Bungoma politicians going out to serve other places yet their county was in the wrong hands. Waluke had earlier declared that he would run in 2022 to unseat Wangamati but now says he has halted his plans and opted to support Wanyonyi. He said despite Wanyonyi coming from a different party, it was a high time Bungoma residents put aside their political differences and supported a sober leadership. Waluke is in Jubilee Party and is closely associated with Deputy President William Ruto while Wanyonyi is in ODM. Wanyonyi is the younger brother to Bungoma Senator  and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula. Wetang’ula  fell out with Governor Wycliffe Wangamati when the governor joined MPs Eseli Simiyu and Wafula Wamunyinyi  in an  attempted coup to take over the Lion party. Wetang’ula has since been campaigning for Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka to come for the Bungoma gubernatorial  seat which he lost in the last elections. Reached  on phone Wanyonyi declined to comment on the matter. "No comment," his text message read. Edited by Henry Makori
