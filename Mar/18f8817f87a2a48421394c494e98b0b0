A county government official who has been using his influence to abuse women and young girls was arrested on Tuesday. The man, who is well connected to politicians, has been using his influence and money to prey on innocent girls. Last year, he abused a young girl after luring her with a purported school bursary offer. He has previously evaded arrest but today police got him. The accused Juma Omar Mwasifa is said to have taken advantage of the minor in the pretense of helping her secure county bursary in Msambweni constituency. It is alleged that Mwasifa conspired with a boda boda who delivered the innocent girl to him at a local hotel. The police records state that onÂ September 29, 2020, Mwasifa took the girl to one of the villas in Diani where he raped her. The class seven pupil full of hopes had carried the required school documents with her only to be defiled later when the accused locked the door and performed the heinous act. Mwasifa was arrested on Tuesday after a long period of escaping police dragnet, according to the prosecution. He denied all the charges but the court refused to release him on bail fearing he might tamper with the ongoing investigations. Furthermore, the International Justice Mission had asked the court not to give the accused bail. The rights organization argued that Mwasifa had strong political influences in the county and he was likely to interfere with the witnesses. The accused is being held at Kwale GK prison. The case is scheduled for mention on March 30.
