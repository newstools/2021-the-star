Fares hiked, no buses, passengers stranded. These is what some Kenyans are going through at Machakos country bus ahead of lockdown deadline. The government had explained that Kenyans have until today 8pm to get into or out of five 'infected zones'. These areas include; Nairobi, Machakos, Nakuru, Kajiado and Kiambu counties. Since this directive was issued on Friday, Kenyans in those disease infected areas have tried to leave with no buses on sight. A spot check by the Star indicated that many passengers arrived at the bus station as early as 4am but were still stranded. "Vehicles are no where to be seen. We are so frustrated. We need the president's help," a passenger Michael Otieno said. "I came here at 5am and I am still here at the bus terminal. Let them give us a way forward!" Another passenger Opiyo Otieno from Kasarani says that there are no buses to take them to Kisumu. "I was supposed to go to work in Kisumu. when I reached here, there were no buses. All buses are gone," he said. "Fare prices have also been hiked. Right now we are paying Sh3,500 from Nairobi to Kisumu." Otieno said Uhuru should just lift the lockdown so that businesses can continue. Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said the transition period is for Kenyans who may be stranded away from work places. "This is also for students who may want to travel home after the closure of schools," Oguna said. President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a cessation of all movement by road, train or air in and out of Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and Nakuru Counties until otherwise notified. He also directed immediate closure of all learning institutions as a move to curb the surging virus infections in the country. Uhuru on Friday said only students sitting the national examinations and those in medical training centres will be allowed to proceed with physical learning.
