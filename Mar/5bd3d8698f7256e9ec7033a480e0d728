West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo has warned that county executive committee members who fail to take the Covid-19 vaccine will be sacked. Speaking at Kapenguria County Referral Hospital after being vaccinated, Lonyangapuo dispelled rumours about the vaccine, maintaining that it is safe for human health. The governor, accompanied by county staff, urged the public to desist from listening to misconceptions about the jab and come out in large numbers and get vaccinated. “I urge all residents and Kenyans at large to take the jab without fear as the vaccine will help in combating Covid-19 and flattening the infection curve,” he said urging frontline health workers to get the jab. He cautioned those spreading negative rumours about the vaccine that no government can approve the use of a vaccine that will harm its people. "I call on county officials to act as an example by ensuring that they also get vaccinated. Those who will not partake the exercise in my government will be sending a negative message to the public," added the governor. Lonyangapuo urged residents to follow instructions given by the government and stop holding on to outdated cultural beliefs that can hamper efforts to combat the pandemic. “Our county is the only one still washing hands at the main entrance,” Lonyangapuo said. Kapenguria county referral hospital medical superintendent David Karuri said the county had vaccinated over 216 health workers, of which 166 were male and 50 female. In total, 1,500 people had got the jab. He joined the county boss in rallying other members of staff and residents to volunteer for vaccination. West Pokot county has so far received 6,000 doses of the vaccine targeting frontline health workers. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
