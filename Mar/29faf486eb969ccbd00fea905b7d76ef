More than 700,000 Nyamira county residents are relieved after the Kemsa supplied Sh32.6 million medical supplies. The consignment of assorted commodities was flagged off by Governor Amos Nyaribo and will be distributed to more than 115 health facilities. Acting Kemsa Chief Executive Officer Edward Njoroge said the authority has a robust distribution network ensuring supplies reach various locations within the week. He reaffirmed the authority’s continued effort to supply counties effectively and on time. “Nyamira has today demonstrated it puts the health of its residents first by making sure that public health facilities are fully stocked,” Njoroge said. He called Nyamira  a good client, citing its good credit history and payments that do not exceed 360 days. The November order was valued at Sh18 million. Njoroge called on other counties to monitor their heath budgets to have a consistent supply of products and technologies. Delivery of the medical commodities demonstrates the strong partnership between Kemsa and the counties, he said. “If there is one thing we will not compromise on, it is quality. All our products go through rigorous tests to confirm that they are fit for use,” the acting CEO said. Njoroge attributed the improved response time to an established customer service department that can receive, filter and facilitate a fast order-processing schedule for the counties, thereby minimising errors.
