Two KCSE candidates will have to write their exams, which started Friday, at the Kenyatta National Hospital- Othaya Annex maternity. Nyeri county commissioner Loyford Kibaara said this is after one of them developed labour pains on Thursday while the second had complications after delivering. Kibaara, however, said the Kenya National Examination Council (Knec), invigilators and security officials will ensure the two sit their exams. A total of 18,532 students will be sitting the exams in Nyeri county. During KCPE exams that ended on Wednesday, there were four students who had various issues, including diabetes and pregnancy. They sat their exams in hospitals, according to Kibaara. The administrator said there is a medical team on standby to handle any health issue that may arise in the course of the exams. He also emphasised on the need to follow the Covid-19 protocols. “Our major concern is that we should remind ourselves about the protocols because of Covid-19, that is washing of hands, social distancing and wearing face masks properly, which is being adhered to in schools that we have visited,” he said. Kibaara spoke during the opening of the 2021 KCSE exams container in Nyeri Central subcounty on Friday. Knec chairman John Onsati said they will ensure the KCSE examination is successful just like the KCPE exam. Security officials, he said, will guard the exams from the container to the school, during writing of the examination and back. “We are not going to compromise the quality at any stage. So as we go out there, (you should keep in mind that) it is a serious business and we must all follow the guidelines provided,” he said. He called on the managers to ensure learners follow all the Ministry of Health protocols to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
