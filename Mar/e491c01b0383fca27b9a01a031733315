Tiktok has introduced new tools that give content creators more control to decide the type of comments they would like to appear on their videos. Additionally, people posting unkind or inappropriate comments will be given a second chance to reconsider their comments before posting. The additional measures are part of TikTok’s #SharingPositivity campaign to reduce bullying and harassment on the platform. It also reminds users about TikTok’s Community Guidelines and allows them to edit their comments before sharing. Creators put their heart and soul into creating content millions of people love, and TikTok is working to give them even more control over their content. With the new Filter All Comments feature, creators can decide which comments will appear on their videos. When enabled, comments will not be displayed unless the video's creator approves them using the new comment management tool. The feature builds on TikTok’s existing collection of comment controls that allow people to filter spam and offensive comments, and specific keywords. Comments are an important way for community members to connect with creators, and TikTok continues to develop ways to promote respectful discussion.
