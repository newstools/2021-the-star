A student at Homa Bay Vocational Training Centre drowned in Lake Victoria on Sunday evening while bathing. Peter Onyango, a masonry student, drowned near the Homa Bay pier. He was 19. Women who were frying fish some metres away saw him having difficulties before he sank in the water. Homa Bay VTC board of management chairman Hezekiah Oduor said the student left the college to go and buy some personal items in town. Oduor said they did not know he was going to bathe in the lake. “The student was given permission to go and buy personal items in town. We’re shocked to learn that he drowned in the lake,” Oduor said. Homa Bay Township senior chief Joshua Ochogo said they are liaising with various stakeholders to help in the retrieval of the student’s body. “We have informed the police and department of disaster management to help us get back the body,” Ochogo said. The administrator called on residents to stop bathing at the lake shore to prevent deaths. He said that the same place had claimed about three lives in the last one year. “We’re not going to allow people to bathe in the lake. It pollutes the water and kills people,” Ochogo said. Residents led by Fred Ombogo appealed to the county and national governments to fence the area to prevent people from bathing there. “People are accustomed to bathing here. We appeal to the governments to fence this area to prevent deaths,” Ombogo said Edited by Kiilu Damaris
