Total Kenya has launched new packaging for its entire range of lubricants with an aim to maintain a distinctive design for consumers to identify their products. In addition to these design developments, Total Lubricants contributes to the Group’s ambition to become the responsible energy major. A reduction in the weight of packaging will prevent the emission of 9,500 tons of CO2 equivalent each year resulting to raw materials savings. The new Lubricants packaging was unveiled by Kenyan long-distance runner and marathon record-holder Eliud Kipchoge who is Total Kenya’s brand partner. “We have always offered products that are customer centric,” said Olagoke Aluko, Managing Director, Total Kenya PLC. “But today’s consumer needs customized information about products and how to use them, this has led us to innovate and redesign our lubricants packaging by giving them a new shape, color and label.” The Total Lubricants package upgrade is a major step forward incorporating innovative features that reinforce the proven authenticity of Total products. Consumers can now identify the product they need immediately, with the new color coding: Platinum for top-tier, Silver for mid-tier and Bronze for entry range products. Buyers can zoom in on the product they need by checking the new label, which is much clearer and easier to read. The new packages are being rolled out gradually as from last year December in every Total service station and authorized distributor outlet across the country and beyond.
