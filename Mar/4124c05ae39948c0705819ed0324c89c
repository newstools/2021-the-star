Only two per cent of land in Siaya County is registered, with title deeds, according to Lands CEC Adrian Ouma. He told the Star that 18 per cent of land, consisting of urban centres such as Yala, Ugunja, Sega, Ukwala, Nyadorera, Siaya, Ng'iya, Bondo, Akala, Ndori Usenge, Aram and Madiany is registered as plots by the defunct local authorities. The lands department is now calling on those with local authorities allotments letters to process the titles under the urban renewal programme launched in January by Governor Cornel Rasanga. Ouma noted that with title deeds, residents in urban centres can acquire loans to develop properties on such plots. "The value of the current non- titled land is low and non-attractive to new local investors," he said. The county executive pointed out that increased access to loans will help to improve the landscape input in the county's urban centres. The urban renewal and improvement of town aesthetics started in Siaya town, with the launch of rehabilitation of open spaces . The changing landscape in Siaya County kicked off with the improvement at Ahindi gardens and Governor's Park as well as the governor' s office complex built at a cost of Sh75 million. Governor Rasanga said the county government had earlier embarked on essential service delivery in the last seven years and was now focussing it's attention in allocating some resources to improve the image of towns.
