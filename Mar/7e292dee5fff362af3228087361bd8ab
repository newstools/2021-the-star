The United Democratic Alliance candidate in the Kiamokama by-elections in Kisii Nyandusi Nyakeramba has been arrested. Also arrested are politicians Don Bosco (Kitutu Chache South), Zaheer Chanda (Nyaribari Chache) and a press aide in the Kisii County Governor's office Dalfant Nyatige. Police, however, say they had only helped 'secure their safety from some people who were out to harm them'. Nyakeramba was picked from outside the gate to his house while Bosco was seized metres away from Emeroka polling station. There were claims some ODM goons were targeting to attack them over claims of voter bribery. Voters turned up at dawn Thursday across Kiamokama Ward in Masaba South, Kisii to pick a new ward representative. The seat was left vacant by the death of MCA Kennedy Mainya in November last year due to Covid-related complications. At least 11 candidates are contesting for the seat. Among the contenders are ODM's Malack Matara, Daniel Ondabu (Party of Economic Development) and Nyandusi Nyakeramba (UDA). Masaba South Sub-County Returning officer Mark Manco said they expect the voting to be peaceful throughout the day. Security has since been intensified across all the 22 polling stations in the area. The regional police boss said two security agents will be manning each poll Centre. More officers will be on patrol to ward off any law breakers.
