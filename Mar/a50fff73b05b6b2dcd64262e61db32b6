A case by farmers seeking to stop a trade pact between Kenya and UK will be heard on March 10. High Court judge Weldon Korir directed the Kenya small scale farmers who filed the case to serve the state with their suit papers. However, because there is no temporary order issued by the court so far, the two countries can go ahead and approve the deal if they so wish. In their suit papers the farmers said their main issue is for public participation in relation to the pact to be conducted at grassroots level so that everyone's views are captured. The agreement among other things reduces tariffs on imports of products such as chicken, pork and maize for a period of 25 years. The trade deal will also mean reduction of 10 per cent duty on intermediate goods after seven years from the time of its ratification. But the farmers say the deal will hurt the rural farmers as their products will have to compete with those from the UK. The farmers together with Econews Africa believe the trade deal contravenes their rights and freedoms.
