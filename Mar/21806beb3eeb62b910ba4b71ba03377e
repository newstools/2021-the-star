Nairobi health workers this week will start getting the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. The city has received 138,000 doses; more will be coming. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said vaccination will start with front line workers: 400,000 health care workers, followed by police and teachers. The Nairobi Metropolitan Services will distribute doses in 16 hospitals, both public and private. The hospitals are KNH, Mama Lucy, Pumwani, Mbagathi, Memorial, Moi Airbase, Mathari, National Spinal Injury and Kenyatta University Teaching and Referral Hospital. Also St Francis Community Hospital, Aga Khan and Nairobi hospitals, Jamaa Mission Hospital, Coptic and Ruaka Uhai Neema and  Mater Misericordiae hospitals.  Last week on Wednesday, 1.02 million doses of the vaccine arrived at JKIA. They are part of an initial allocation of  3.56 million doses. The vaccines were procured and delivered by Unicef as part of the COVAX initiative. The following day, President Uhuru Kenyatta flagged off trucks carrying vaccines to the Central Vaccine Depot in Kitengela, Kajiado county. On Friday, the first 10 people received the Covid-19-19 vaccine at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi.
