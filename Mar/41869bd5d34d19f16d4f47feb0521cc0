Tuk-tuk drivers in Kisumu have complained about the directive by Governor Anyang' Nyong'o that they carry a maximum of two passengers to combat Covid-19. This was one of the directives issued on Tuesday by the County Covid-19 Multi-Agency Committee led by the governor following a surge in Covid cases in the country. The operators said they should have been consulted so that they reach an amicable solution. Driver Elvis Kasoli noted that following increased fuel prices, they won't have an easy time as most of them are employed and have a target each day from their employers. “Some of us send Sh1,200 per day to the owners of the tuk-tuks and if we are to carry two people, which is Sh 20 per person, it's going to be a challenge. Remember at the stages where we park we pay Sh20 per head,” he said. Kasoli said they should be allowed to do their work while observing Covid-19 rules. “We should sit down and discuss this because we also want to stay safe and help the county in combating this virus." George Obiero, a leader within the sector, said: “It's impossible to carry only two passengers in a tuk-tuk and they ought to be consultation with sector leaders for a favourable solution before such a directive is imposed". Obiero noted that the decision should be reconsidered , adding that as a sector they support the war on the virus and they will always follow the laid-down rules and regulations, but on this, they need further consultation. "They should also provide us with sanitiser, amongst other required equipment to stay safe and keep customers safe." The Kisumu County Covid-19 Multi-Agency Committee approved thee containment measures. All morgues were directed not to preserve dead bodies for a period exceeding 72 hours and not to release anybody after 10am. There shall be no night vigil in the homes of the deceased; the maximum persons allowed in any burial ceremony is 100 people and there shall be no catering services at funerals.
