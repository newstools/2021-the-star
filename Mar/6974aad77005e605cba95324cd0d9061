Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu has closed the Kericho law courts after the discovery of architectural flaws following modification of the building in 2014. In a letter dated March 5, Mwilu ordered the building be vacated to avert a potential disaster. The temporary closure of the courts was recommended by the Public Works department after a structural investigation on the building between February 16 and February 17. During the closure period, cases will continue through virtual platforms with documents being filed online. Chief registrar Anne Amadi said county and national governments are in discussions on how to secure alternative facilities to house the courts. Amadi said court users and the public will be notified of the new location once it's operational. “I hasten to add that much as we have made significant improvements to our infrastructure over the past 10 years, many of our courts remain in a dilapidated state,” the letter stated in part. Amadi said more funds are needed for the immediate construction of Kericho law courts.
