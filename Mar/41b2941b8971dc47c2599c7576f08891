Kenya Volleyball Federation have made changes to their fixtures in a bid to pave way for Kenya Basketball League matches at Nyayo National Stadium. According to the latest changes, Kenya Defence Forces have been pitted against Directorate of Criminal Investigation and Nairobi Water teams on March 19 at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. KDF coach Pius Birech said he expects tough opposition from the two teams but was confident of overcoming the challenge as they seek to move from bottom of the table. The soldiers have played just one match against KCB and lost. The team missed the first leg matches due to unavailability of players owing to work related commitments. Although KDF are not yet a full house, Birech said squad rotation will be key if they have to record good results going forward. "DCI are a good side  with a blend of young and experienced players. They have  played together for the last two years and it will be a big test for us. We have to be on top of our game and see what we can achieve after the final whistle," he noted. He added: "We still have players out but we don't need to keep on crying but strive to prepare well for both matches. Against KCB, blocks were our biggest problem and we hope to improve on the department." Birech admitted that even though it is still early in the season, it's unrealistic for his team to target the title. On the same day, KCB play Nairobi  Prisons as Kenya Prisons take on Kenya Pipeline.
