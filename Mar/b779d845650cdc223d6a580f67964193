ODM has expressed confidence that the EACC will clear ex-Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority boss Pavel Oimeke to vie for Bonchari MP. Secretary general Edwin Sifuna on Friday said he was 100 per cent sure the anti-graft agency will give Oimeke a clearance certificate. “People are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Oimeke will not be denied the certificate because of the matter he is having in court,” Sifuna said when he handed over the nomination certificate to Oimeke at Chungwa House. Oimeke resigned from EPRA to vie for the seat amid an ongoing corruption case in court. He is accused of obtaining a Sh200,000 bribe from a fuel station owner. He is out on bond. Oimeke is accused of demanding the money to approve the reopening of the petrol station in Oyugis, which had been shut down over tax violations. He allegedly received the bribe in a trap set up by  EACC detectives. The fuel station had been closed by KRA for selling fuel meant for export. The station was fined Sh309, 000 by the taxman and issued with a clearance letter for Oimeke to authorise reopening. The party asked the IEBC to ensure it conducts a free and fair election on May 18. The by-election was occasioned by the death of John Oyioka on February 15. Sifuna expressed confidence that the party will win in the by-election. “Party primaries are not the only ODM picks its candidates. ODM has four methods and we picked one to chose our Bonchari candidate,” he said. National Election Board chairperson Catherine Mumma said Oimeke will beat other contestants for the seat. She said three candidates applied for the party’s ticket — John Momanyi, David  Ogega and Oimeke. Mumma said they dropped Ogega since he was not dully registered as a member of the party. The party then opted for a consensus to get the best candidate. Oimeke called for peaceful and non-confrontational election. “I will now head to the ground to sell my candidature,” he stated.
