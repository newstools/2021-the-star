Police in Migori police are holding a woman over the stabbing to death of a Form 3 student in Kuna village following a land dispute. Police said Joyce Achieng Omollo, 27, attacked her brother-in-law Alphonse Omondi, 19, a student at Kameji Secondary School, with a kitchen knife and stabbed him several times in the chest. Omondi was rushed to Lwala Community Hospital in North Kamagambo, where he was referred to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital. He succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment. “Joyce had complained that Omondi and his mother had ploughed their land right behind her house, the bitter exchange went from verbal to tragic,” North Kamwango assistant chief Chales Goi said. Goi said Omondi had tried to intervene when he was attacked. Rongo subcounty police commander Peter Okiring said investigations into the incident have started. “The incident was very unfortunate. We have booked the suspect. We expect to have her arraigned in court to answer to murder charges once we are through with investigations,” Okiring said.
