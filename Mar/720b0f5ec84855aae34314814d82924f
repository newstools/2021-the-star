Acting CJ Philomena Mwilu has announced the closure of the Mavoko law courts for 10 days after seven staffers tested positive for Covid-19. One of the seven succumbed to the virus. "On behalf of the Judiciary family, and on my own behalf, I express our deepest condolences to his family, friends and his colleagues in the Judiciary," Mwilu said on Friday. "We are grateful for the time he served the institution. We pray that God grants eternal peace to his soul and to his family, the fortitude to bear this loss." The positive cases were released after mass testing on 24 staffers. Meanwhile, Mwilu said the Judiciary is closely monitoring the situation at Kithimani Law Courts where, out of a staff component of 16, three have tested positive for Covid-19 and are currently under quarantine. On Wednesday, the family division at the Milimani law courts was closed after three staffers tested positive for Covid-19. There are a total of 53 staffers and legal researchers, 10 attached students, two judicial officers and four judges in the Family Division.
