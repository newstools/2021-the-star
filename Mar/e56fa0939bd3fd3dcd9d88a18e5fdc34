Cabinet Secretary for Education George Magoha on Friday warned private school teachers who did not register learners for the national examinations that they will be punished without mercy. He, however, said that every child who deserves to do the examination must do it. The exams are set to start on Monday. “There are a few unscrupulous teachers in the private schools who I understand did not register students for examinations. We are not going to allow our children to suffer because of a few crooks,” Magoha said. Magoha was speaking at Kakamega Primary School during a visit to monitor KCPE exam rehearsals. He added that the ministry's firm instructions are that as the multi-agencies investigate those teachers and proprietors and the children must sit the exams. “We shall deal with the results afterward, in any case, it’s very strange because the government pays examination fees for all the children, both in private and public schools.” Magoha said it was criminal for private schools to charge examination fees and fail to register children for exams. The CS also warned against any plans to engage in exam cheating, saying the ministry will not allow unscrupulous people to abuse and trade with the lives of learners. “Homa Bay has joined in the group that is planning to interfere with examinations and I want to warn them that those officers, both in the schools and outside schools, that we are watching very closely what you are trying to do, you attempt it and we shall come on to you like fire.” He also cited Isbania in Migori and parts of Kisii as hotspots. Prof Magoha, however, reassured the students that there was nothing to worry about as the exams commence on Monday. “The government is fully prepared, it's all systems go, we have a multi-agency system that is already on the ground, exams are in the distribution centers, together with the ministry of interior and other agencies we are very ready to go.” he said.
