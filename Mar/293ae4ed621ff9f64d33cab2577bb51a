Lamu has initiated the first phase of Covid-19 vaccination, targeting its 897 health workers before expanding to cover the police, county government workers and teachers. The county received its first 1,500 doses from the national government last Saturday. Speaking during the exercise at King Fahad Hospital on Lamu island, Health executive Anne Gathoni urged health workers to accept the jab as their reception would influence the rest of the county. Gathoni asked the residents to be positive and avail themselves for the vaccine once they are told to do so. “The vaccine is safe for use and that’s why I have taken it myself. Let's come out and be immunised whenever we are called upon. We are dealing with health workers first then the rest of the frontline workers and thereafter, the masses,”  Gathoni said. She was the first to receive the jab on Monday. County chief officer for Medical Services and Public Health Victor Tole said they had established three Covid-19 vaccination centres. They are the Lamu King Fahad Referral Hospital, which will serve residents of Lamu Island; the Faza Subcounty Hospital centre to serve Lamu East residents; and Mpeketoni Subcounty Hospital Centre that will handle Lamu West residents. He said more centres will be set up in due time. “We are confident that the turnout will be positive bearing in mind the sensitisation campaigns that we have conducted in the last few days, ” Tole said. He also revealed that there will be outreach programmes in the coming phases of the exercise. County public health promotion officer Ahmed Muhsin, however, said the 1,500 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine were below the target population. Lamu has a population of 143,920 people, according to the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census Report. He called upon the government to fast-track the dispatch of more doses to ensure more people get vaccinated.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
