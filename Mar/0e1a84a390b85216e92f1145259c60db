Enterprise cup champions Kabras have released South African duo of Ntokozo Vidima and Aphiwe Stemele from their 35-man Kenya Cup squad. The duo was only signed in October during the transfer window but did not make the final squad for the season, according to chairman Phillip Jalango. "What we have done is that the coach picked a squad of 35 and those who didn’t make the squad had to be released and are free to join clubs of their choice,” noted Jalango. Vidima, a utility player capable of featuring at flanker, second-row and the back row alongside his compatriot Aphiwe who plays as a fly-half, were acquired from Border Bulldogs of South Africa in October last year. The departure of the South African players leaves the Kakamega-based outfit with three foreign-based players including Fijian duo of Jone Kubu, Timoci Senaite and South African Dukisa Ntabeni. He added that squad rotation will be key due to the late start of the season occasioned by the Ministry of Sports giving them the green light to resume the sport. "I believe the coach and the technical bench will rotate the team to give everyone a chance and ensure that the  squad remains fresh once we get to the business end of the season,” noted Jalango. The sugar millers have won their two opening matches, beating Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology 56-0 and Strathmore Leos 35-9 though Jalango admits tougher tests lie in wait. "We are in for surprises and upsets this season. Who expected Menengai Oilers to be on  top of the table at this point?” added Jalango. Kabras face a rejuvenated Quins side on Saturday in what promises to be an entertaining clash. The two sides met during the Charity Cup opener last month with Kabras winning 29-10 but Jalango expects a tough contest this time around. "This will be a different game. Quins were without some of their players and still won against Impala. I am sure that win will fire them up in their next clash,” he said .
