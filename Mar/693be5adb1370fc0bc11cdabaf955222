Jambojet will temporarily suspend operations between Nairobi and Mombasa, Kisumu and Eldoret, Malindi and Diani starting noon, March 29, 2021 until further notice. This comes after President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday announced the cessation of all movement by road, train or air in and out of Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and Nakuru Counties until otherwise notified. This is a move the government has chosen to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the country. "We regret to inform all our customers and business partners that all the flights for the subsequent period on these routes are cancelled with immediate effect. "We further advise all passengers scheduled to travel after March 29, 2021 to hold on to their tickets, and their flights will be rescheduled to a later date at no extra cost," Jambojet said in a statement. Jambojet further added that the value of these tickets will remain valid for a period of 12 months from March 29, 2021. Jambojet will operate flights as scheduled from 27th to noon, 29th March and will also continue to operate daily direct flights between Mombasa, Kisumu and Eldoret.
