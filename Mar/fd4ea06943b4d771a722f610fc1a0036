Juventus vs Benevento Sunday 5 pm Juventus look set to register a fourth top-flight win in a row for the first time this season. Over the last four campaigns, they have won 13 of their 14 home league matches played against the Serie 'A'  newcomers, beating a -1 handicap nine times. Juventus are on a run of seven home Serie 'A' wins, with each seeing them overcome a -1 handicap, although the last two stood level at half time. Benevento are winless in 11 top-flight fixtures and the prospect of a relegation fight until the bitter end looks very realistic. The visitors have lost each of their five away league matches against teams that are currently sitting in the top-nine, losing via a 2+ goal margin on four occasions. Additionally, Benevento have conceded an average of 2.0 goals per game beyond the hour mark across their previous three away matches against a current top-six side.

It was also their eighth defeat across their previous nine Serie ‘A’ games and a league-high 12th instance of conceding three-plus goals. Therefore, whilst five consecutive Serie ‘A’ head-to-heads have been decided via a single-goal margin — with four ending 1-0 — a repeat looks unlikely as 70 per cent of Crotone’s Serie ‘A’ losses have come by at least a two-goal margin. Bologna’s push for a top-ten finish has seen them pick up 11 points from their last seven games the sixth-best points tally during this period. Extending that record could be boosted by starting well, as Bologna have picked up points in almost all of the Serie ‘A’ matches in which they scored first. Their away form isn’t that impressive as it has Bologna winning just once across their last ten SA road trips, conceding first in all five losses, four of which came through a two-goal margin.

The mid-table side haven’t scored in both halves of a home league game this season, and have claimed just one-half time lead this campaign. Wolfsburg have scored over 2.5 goals in four Bundesliga games this term. That includes their most recent outing, a 5-0 thrashing of Schalke that consolidated their Uefa Champions League qualification placing, and gave them an eighth clean sheet from nine Bundesliga matches. Wolfsburg’s average of 1.46 goals scored per Bundesliga road trip suggests they can cause a nuisance here, although both teams have scored in seven of their away league fixtures this term. Interestingly, they also boast an excellent 87.5 per cent unbeaten record in Bundesliga away matches entered as favourites this season.
