Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu on Wednesday said President Uhuru Kenyatta inspired her to take the Covid-19 vaccine. Ngilu said she has been apprehensive of taking the Astrazeneca vaccine until the  President got the jab. “Just like many other Kenyans who were fearful, I was apprehensive. I got the inspiration to get vaccinated after the President did the same,” Ngilu said. She spoke at the Kitui County Referral Hospital soon after she led several church leaders in taking the Covid-19 jab. On March 10, she was expected to launch the vaccination exercise in her county but she did not. “Now that the President led the way, I have equally agreed to be vaccinated as the President helped to reassure Kenyans and build confidence in them that the vaccine was safe for all people,” Ngilu said. She disclosed that the number of people visiting health facilities to get the jab had doubled after the President was vaccinated. The governor said she had invited various church leaders in Kitui to join her and get vaccinated because they too should help in popularising the jab among the faithful. She called on Kitui people to come out in big numbers and be vaccinated. “Many people in Kitui have died of  Covid -19.  Some of them we will never come to know about their demise because they get infected at home and shortly die without getting to a health facility,”  the governor said.
