The body of a girl who disappeared on Monday evening in Rwathia in Kangema was found on Tuesday morning in a farm with her chest bruised and genitals mutilated. Neighbours mounted a search from 7pm when Hannah Wambui, eight, was declared missing up to midnight and called it off to resume the following morning. Subcounty police commander John Ogola said the child had been with her father in his shop at Kianguku and disappeared shortly after he stepped out. Ogola said police could not immediately establish whether the girl had been defiled before being murdered. He said residents suspected a neighbour who had allegedly attempted to rape a woman before fleeing eight months ago. “The man returned to the village two weeks ago but we are yet to establish whether he was involved in any way,” Ogola said. The suspect has been arrested. Residents appealed to the police to expedite investigations and ensure the culprit or culprits are prosecuted.
