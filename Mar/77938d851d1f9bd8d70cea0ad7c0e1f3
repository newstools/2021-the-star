Mandera Governor Ali Roba has mourned the death of his Finance executive Ibrahim Hassan who succumbed to Covid-19. Hassan was rushed to Nairobi on Monday where he had been receiving treatment until his death on Friday. Roba said he had lost not only a friend but a dedicated civil servant who gave his all to serve residents. "Early this morning, we lost our brother Ibrahim Barrow Hassan to Covid-19. Ibrahim has been the CEC for Finance and Economic planning for the last eight and a half years in Mandera County Government,"said Roba. Through his Facebook page, he added, " He was a disciplined and dedicated staffer who transformed financial management at the county with very special commitment to deliver results." Jubilee joint Parliamentary Group (PG) Aden Keynan said the virus has robbed the country of a hardworking and proficient public servant. "As a man with passion, energy and commitment, Mr Barrow performed his duties with great sincerity and brilliance," Keynan, who is also the Eldas MP, said through his Facebook page. "I wish to beseech Kenyans to join hands and follow the Ministry of Health protocols to combat and defeat this Covid-19 enemy," he said.
