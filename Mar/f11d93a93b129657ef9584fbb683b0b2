The second Nairobi Invitational Cricket League (NICL) Twenty20 reaches its climax this Sunday as defending champions Kanbis take on Sir Ali Muslim Club at the Nairobi Gymkhana. The top two sides in the tournament’s pool stage have already met twice in the tournament with Sir Ali registering convincing wins. Last Saturday’s 101 loss to Sir Ali forced Kanbis into a second qualifier against Swamibapa, where they sailed with a 3-wicket win to book a place in the final for a third meeting with the Park Road side in a span of three wickets. Sir Ali has been the tournament’s stand-out team with Aushutosh Sharma and  Vinayak Shukla emerging best in this year’s campaign. Together with George Kamangu and Zahid Abbas, Sir Ali batting line-up will be featuring in their second major final and have exuded confidence of pulling a surprise. But while the batting lineup has been at their best, the bowlers have failed to live up to expectations. Abdul Rehman, Shashak Awasthi, and Sharma have controlled their opponents' runs flow so well amid magnificent form with the ball. Sir Ali fans have seen their side’s form improve remarkably since the arrival of Sharma, Shukla, and Awasthi. They have been responsible for a number of remarkable results the team has registered since the return of cricket in the country a month ago. Delhi will be hoping their top batsmen Dhiren Gondaria and Rakep Patel stay longer on the crease. The two have the potential of destroying any batting lineup but their mojo seems to have disappeared with the return of cricket in the country. It is the prayer of every Kanbis fan that the two display their best form against Sir Ali. Jignesh Kerai proved that with a lot of support, he could stabilize the opponent's bowling and it will be interesting to see how he performs. Once again, a lot will be expected from Nischay Kerai, who has on many occasions been the key bowler. Vinod Rabadia is expected to lead Kanbis in the absence of injured Rajesh Bhudia.
