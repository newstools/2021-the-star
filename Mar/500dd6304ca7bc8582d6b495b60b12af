DJ Creme de la Creme has proposed to Denise, his partner of 14 years and mother of his two children. Taking to social media, he shared a photo of the ring, describing her as his best friend. “It took me 14 years. 14 loong years to ask my best friend, my confidant, mother to my kids, my forever person, to marry me,” he wrote. "I know I've stressed you out so many times but my heart and all I got belongs to you. I wanna love you forever." Creme later appreciated the fans and celebrities who congratulated them. “Thank you for all the warm messages. Much appreciated." In 2019, Creme had promised to get married by the end of that year. "I am having the wedding soon and it is one thing I am working on," he told Word Is at the time.
