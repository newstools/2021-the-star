Kitui Catholic Bishop Joseph Mwongela has urged politicians and the public to desist from spreading hatred and creating divisions, as this would derail development and risk the lives of innocent Kenyans. The bishop called upon Kenyans to embrace one another and to avoid any form of divisions, which may arise out of their different political alignments. Speaking during the burial of a mother to one of his priests at Nuu in Mwingi East sub-county, Kitui county, Bishop Mwongela said that what Kenya as a country needs most is peace and harmony and Kenyans canâ€™t afford ethnic-based hatred. He urged Christians, especially those of the Catholic faith, to love one another and pray for the nation during this period of Lent when Christians remember the passion of Jesus Christ. On vaccines, the Kitui Bishop urged the government to ensure that all Kenyans benefit equally and that transparency and accountability prevail during the entire process. He urged government officials to ensure that no irregularities are witnessed.
