Homeboyz coach Nicholas Muyoti has expressed his excitement following the return of former international Allan Wanga after recovery from an injury. Muyoti said Wanga, who previously served as player-coach, is an experienced player with great leadership skills which will come in handy as they seek to challenge the teams above them on the log. Homeboyz are currently eighth with 21 points, 15 adrift of runaway leaders, having won six, drawn three and lost seven matches so far. “You can agree with me that since he (Wanga) got injured, we have struggled to get the goals. But we are very happy that our medical team has done a tremendous job which has seen him return earlier than expected," said Muyoti. “I also want to urge my players to be all-rounded as we aim to push harder as the league approaches the homestretch." “We have brought in few players who are giving us what we have been lacking since the start of the season and I believe we will maintain the consistency as we move forward," added the former international. "We have to forget the bad form we endured in the initial stages of the league, where we struggled and dropped many points." The former AFC Leopards coach and player also hailed the impact of new signing, Stephen Opoku, after his solitary goal handed his Boyz all the points against Sofapaka on Sunday. Muyoti said he is already preparing for his next match, against Kariobangi Sharks on April 2.
