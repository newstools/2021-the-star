Hundreds of youths involved in the Ng'arisha Jiji Initiative have yet to receive their payments from City Hall despite participating in the clean-up of the county's 85 wards. They were contracted in 2018 for an environmental protection campaign that included unblocking sewers, removing campaign posters, clearing mounds of garbage and disposing of garbage. Three years later, they have yet to be paid for the services they rendered for the nine months of the contract. City Hall has started verifying documents to ascertain the exact amount owed. County assembly Environment committee chairman John Kamau decried the nonpayment despite there being records of the work done. “Kindly let us get some funds to at least pay these youths even if it is for the two months, so they can see we are still thinking about them,” Kamau said. The youth held a demonstration outside the assembly last Thursday demanding they be paid. The assembly's Finance committee chairman Robert Mbatia said the payment process had started with the verification of documents. He blamed the delay on the executive, which he accused of submitting different amount of payments owed. “As much as we seconded these people and they come from the 85 wards, we have a challenge with documentation. Recently, we inquired from the executive how much their bill was, one team gave us Sh80 million and another team gave us Sh50 million for the pending bill," Mbatia said. His committee had directed that all records be made available for scrutiny by both internal and external auditors. “As a committee, we have asked that those records be brought to us for each ward and what is owed to every youth because it is not standard as they are not owed the same amount of money. It is subject to their attendance,” Mbatia said. Once the verification is done, the payment will be factored in the second supplementary budget.  Edited by P.O
