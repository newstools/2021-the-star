Jubilee Deputy secretary general Joshua Kuttuny says the party will punish more than 20 MCAs who acted in violation of the party constitution by voting against the BBI at the county assemblies. Kuttuny says they had already received complaints about the MCAs in some areas including Elgeyo Marakwet county where Governor Alex Tolgos wrote to the party over misconduct by some of the MCAs. “We have received complaints about the conduct of the MCAs and we are in the process of serving them so that they explain why they acted against the party through which they got to where there are,” said Kuttuny. He said among the MCAs to be punished include two at the County Assembly of Nairobi. He was speaking in Eldoret after receiving the party’s candidate Lucy Chomba who won in the Huruma ward by-elections. Lucy trounced 12 other candidates and will now replace her husband Peter Chomba who died of Covid-19 in October last year. Kuttuny said he would lead the process to streamline Jubilee by ensuring that its members adhere to the party constitution. “The party has its constitution and we have the disciplinary committee that will deal with the matter shortly,” said Kuttuny who was appointed to the party position last week to replace Soy MP Caleb Kostany. He said he would bring a new style of leadership in Jubilee, adding that those thinking the party had collapsed would be in for a rude shock. “We will quickly restore order in the party so that it fully supports President Uhuru Kenyatta as he executes his mandate,” said Kuttuny who is also the MP for Cherangany. He blamed DP William Ruto and his allies for what he terms as backstabbing the President causing the split in Jubilee. “Even if there were mistakes in Jubilee it was totally wrong for the DP and his allies to openly disrespect the President and even go to the extend of ridiculing him through social media,”said Kuttuny. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
