A mtumba trader who allegedly impersonated his dead father and tried to steal millions of shillings from his account has been charged at Milimani law court. Francis Waweru, alias James Waweru Ndegwa, was accused of presenting himself as James Waweru Ndegwa, his deceased father, on March 23. The charge sheet said he attempted to defraud National Bank on Harambee Avenue. He denied the charges before chief magistrate Martha Mutuku and pleaded for lenient bond terms. According to the police report, the accused went to the bank and presented the staff an application for digital mobile banking using his deceased father's account. He was arrested and interviewed by the bank. Investigations showed the holder of the bank account was dead but when asked, he said the deceased was his father. Police said Waweru allegedly received a call from his friend who informed him he knows a person at National Bank who could help him access his father's funds. His friend picked him from Roysambu and took him to National Bank headquarters. He filled the forms and gave them to customer service. The tellers became suspicious of his application and alerted security personnel who arrested him. He claimed to have shown the bank his fatherâ€™s death certificate and his mother's death certificate. According to court documents, his father died in 2018 and his mother died earlier. Waweru was released on a cash bail of Sh50,000. The case will be mentioned on April 7. (Edited by V. Graham)
