The body of late former Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli was on Saturday taken to Uhuru Stadium for public viewing. This was after a brief funeral service held at St Peter's Oysterbay Church. The body was carried in a military truck under tight security by Tanzania Defence Forces. Tanzanians flocked to the streets to catch a glimpse of the convoy carrying the late President's remains. Some could be heard wailing. "Uuuwi. Baba, tutapata wapi baba kama wewe (Where will we find another father like you)," a woman was heard saying. At Uhuru Stadium, family consoled Magufuli's widow, Janet, as grief overwhelmed her. Thousands of Tanzanians were seen seated at the 23,000-seat capacity stadium to pay their last respects. Magufuli will be burried on March 25. The body will remain there until March 21 before being bid farewell. On March 22, the body of the late will be moved to Dodoma for public viewing before being moved to Mwanza on March 23. On the same day, the body will be moved to his Chato town where his constituents will have a chance to view the body. On March 24, family members and all international and invited guests will have a chance before the burial day on March 25. According to Samia, Magufuli will be laid to rest after a church service at Chato Catholic Church. Magufuli died on March 17 after a 10-year battle to heart complications. Samia took over as the president after she was sworn-in a few minutes after 10am on Friday.
