A Labour court has barred CS Agriculture Peter Munya from gazetting any candidate as the Managing Director of the Agriculture Finance Corporation. Employment and Labour Relations judge Monica Mbaru certified a case filed by one Javas Bigambo who is challenging the matter in court. Mbaru in her order said, “The CS, and the corporation are hereby restrained from appointing, confirming or taking any further steps towards the gazettement of any candidate or person as the Managing Director of the Agriculture Finance Corporation”. Six days ago, George Kubai was appointed to the helm of the corporation. His appointment comes months after the exit of Lucas Meso from the helm of AFC in October 2020. He previously served as the General Manager of the National Oil Corporation of Kenya after being appointed by Petroleum CS John Munyes.
