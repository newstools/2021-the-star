ODM leader Raila Odinga and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed have called for further reforms in the National Police Service. Raila said police service must be free and fair to all citizens. He said he had received petitions from members of the public complaining about excesses by police officers. He said the era of colonialism when police were used to intimidate and harass the people was over. “We want to change the police behaviour. They should be people’s servants and respect the public,” Raila said. He said it was unethical for police to hurt the same people who pay their salary, uniforms and armory. Raila spoke on Friday at Samburu in Kinango constituency, Kwale county where he led a BBI popularisation campaign. The former Prime Minister said the work of the police is not to cause pain or panic to citizens but to restore hope, justice and provide protection. He said the public is the police boss and the officers must ensure they are fairly served. Raila said police should not harass boda boda riders but offer solutions to their problems for a conducive business environment. Junet warned that national cohesion was in jeopardy if police continue to be irresponsible. “I want to tell the government that one of the things that caused chaos in 2007/08 is when Kenyans lost faith in the police service,” he said. The lawmaker condemned former Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa’s action during Thursday's by-election in Matungu. Echesa was captured on video while assaulting an IEBC official. Junet said he was shocked that a democratic country like Kenya could let people interfere with an election or cause unrest while police took no action. “How is it possible that someone gets in a voting room, removes an IEBC officer with all the materials and gets assaulted in front of security officers,” Junet posed. He termed the action anarchy, saying police lost command. The MP said Kenyans want a country where the rule of law is followed to the letter.
