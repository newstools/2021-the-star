Lovy Longomba, who is currently a prophet, says the death of his brother was not a surprise as he had already been told by God that Christian would rest on Saturday. Lovy heads a church he founded in the US called Revelation Church, Los Angeles. Speaking about the revelation from God, Lovy explained; "My brother fought for a long time. Sometimes to know things prophetically, is not always the best, but God knows. "On the day that he was leaving, God spoke to me and told me, ‘Christian is leaving today.’ I tried everything, spiritually, physically and materially to keep him here, but man, when God speaks, God speaks and there is nothing you can do about it and it is always for the better. Even in this, Jesus is still glorified." Christian was hospitalised for two weeks before he died. "I’m not crying because I don’t know where Christian is, I know where he is, God told me exactly when it was going to happen, we are not surprised by it, you know, living through it is a different thing."
