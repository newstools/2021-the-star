Kitui Deputy Governor Dr Wathe Nzau says they  have completely eradicated locusts from the county. He said this is in collaboration with national government and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The deputy governor said all eight sub-counties of Kitui had been invaded by locusts beginning January this year but the county government controlled them before they could damage crops. “We used aerial spraying in hilly parts of Mumoni, and in areas which were accessible, we used NYS officers, pesticide, and equipment given to us by the national government,” said Wathe. Dr Wathe was speaking at Endui Hills in Waita Location, Mwingi Central Sub-County where the last swarm of locusts was seen. “Farmers in Endui raised concerns that there were locusts spotted on the hills. When an aerial surveillance was done, they were not spotted and together with FAO officers, agricultural officers, and some community members, we climbed the hills where we found an inactive batch of locusts, which have since turned grey in color,” narrated Wathe. He said the locusts posed lesser threats to farmers as they were dormant. The deputy governor said that more surveillance is being done to come up with ways of controlling the locusts in the hills, which are scattered in over 25 hectares. “The officers are also doing close monitoring to unveil several breeding areas where the locusts might be reproducing in order to send the control team,” he said. Wathe said that several methods have been employed in winning the war, including aerial spraying and relying on 50 officers from the National Youth Service for ground spraying.
