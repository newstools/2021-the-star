Umoja coach Kevin Sunguti is concerned about his team’s poor start in the Premier League but believes he will soon steady the ship. The self-supporting side have made their worst start to the league, losing to Thunder, Ulinzi Warriors and Strathmore University. “Yes we have made a bad start but the team is fine. We will battle hard to win at least five games in the first leg, then pick it up from there,” coach Sunguti said. “The problem is we have a lot of new players in the team and we haven’t trained together and we are, therefore, yet to bond.” Griffin Ligare notched 32 points to lift Thunder to a 69-59 victory over Kenyatta University 'Pirates' at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. Reigning champions Ulinzi Warriors left it late before beating Strathmore University “Blades” 76-66 in a cracker. University of Nairobi “Terrorists” put up a spirited last quarter fight but were felled 77-58 by Equity Bank. Women champions Equity Bank had 22 points from Linda Alando as they eclipsed Africa Nazarene University 84-29. The UON women’s side, Dynamites nipped rivals Kenyatta University ‘Oryx’ 55-53 behind 11 points from Winnie Chebet. In Kisumu, Lady Bucks and Lakeside crushed to the visiting Kenya Ports Authority men and women teams 86-21 and 80-65 respectively.
