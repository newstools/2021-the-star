Nyeri county will introduce a free milk programme in all public early childhood development and education centres to boost the health of young learners. This follows the county assembly's overwhelming passage of a motion on the initiative on Tuesday. The House urged the Education department to prioritise the programme in its 2021-22 budget. Some 21,230 ECDE pupils are to benefit. Gikondi MCA Mary Wamuyu, the mover of the motion, on Wednesday told the Star the programme will provide nutritional requirements to improve the children's health while increasing enrolment, attendance and concentration. Wamuyu said a number of children suffer from malnutrition, leading to stunting and wasting. She cited the statistics released by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in 2015 that showed that out of a population of seven million under-fives, 1.82 million were suffering from malnutrition. “Many of these children come from poor families and go to school on empty stomachs. If given milk, they will concentrate in class,” she said. Milk is highly nutritious and contains almost every single nutrient required by the body, she added. Wamuyu said some parts of Nyeri are dry, receive low rainfall and subsequent low food production and the intervention will come in handy. She cited dry areas such as the lower parts of Mukurwe-ini, parts of Kieni, Karima in Othaya and Nyaribo in Nyeri town. The initiative will also provide market for dairy farmers and boost livelihoods and incomes. Wamuyu expressed hope that the executive will understand the need for to support it. “We have agreed with the chairman of the Budget committee in the assembly and his Education counterpart to have a meeting with the CEC for Education so we can put more emphasis on the need to start this programme,” she said. The assembly proposed that the CEC for Education consider partnering with willing private sector members to sponsor the programme as part of their corporate social responsibility.  Edited by F'Orieny
