The Covid-19 vaccine brought into the country will help revive tourism, Chief Administrative Secretary Joseph Boinnet has said. Kenya received 1.02 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine through the global Covax facility on Wednesday. The doses will first be given to the healthcare personnel, security officers and teachers who are the front line workers. Boinnet said the move will help in reviving the ailing tourism sector in the country. The tourism industry suffered after the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world last year leading to travel restrictions and closure of tourism facilities. He said the vaccine will encourage the lifting of international flights restrictions. Boinnet said the government is working hard to promote local tourism. The CAS spoke on Wednesday at Shimoni when he presided over the World Wildlife day in Lunga Lunga. Boinnet said there was a need to protect forests and wildlife as they play a major role in the tourism sector. He said the government has heightened the fight against illegal poaching and warned of stern action against those engaging in the vice. "Like last year no single rhino was killed and it is because we work as a team with various stakeholders, " he said. KWS director general John Waweru cautioned the residents against hunting wildlife.
