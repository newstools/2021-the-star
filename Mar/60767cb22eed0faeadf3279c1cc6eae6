Security agents in Transmara West, Narok county, have taken three suspects into custody over violence along the Enorateet interclan border. At least one person was killed  on Wednesday last week following renewed flare-ups between Uasin Gishu and Siria clans at Nkararo area. Simon Oloitiptip, 36, who has since been buried, was shot after police were deployed to quell tension between the warring factions. On Sunday, police in the subcounty said that they had arrested the youth for being suspected of stoking tension. "This is just part of the start of the operation to weed out elements that are fanning violence," subcounty police commander Hamisi Ganzallah said. The on-and-off skirmishes date back to 1980. Villagers say dozens have died and a number of women widowed. The clans had been contesting demarcation of the border dividing them. They appear not be satisfied by government efforts to build a road along the border. In November 2020 alone, three people were shot dead while 40 houses were torched following the inter-clan skirmishes. Tension is still  high with youth from Uasin Gishu threatening  revenge raids over the death of their kinsman. The government has since deployed hundreds of police officers to monitor the situation. Peace activists led by Pastor Moses Suki urged calm. They further called for justice for the victim. Suki said he was the second person from the clan to be killed in less than a year. "Our clan members have respected the boundary set by the government and its good that justice is served to the families affected by the shootings," Suki said. David Narupa, a village elder, urged Narok Governor Samuel Tunai and Kilgoris MP Gideon Konchellah to intervene and end the blood letting. (Edited by V. Graham)
