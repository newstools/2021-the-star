Embakasi East MP Babu Owino has suffered a blow after the court declined to withdraw his attempted murder case. In the case, DJ Evolve had written to the court, saying that he had forgiven Babu and wanted to focus on his healing. However, Principal Magistrate Benard Ochoi on Monday said the application did not meet the threshold to withdraw the case for now. However, Ochoi said he has not closed avenues for further engagements. Ochoi said he can't withdraw the case and he does not know what Babu has offered DJ Evolve. "Unconditional withdrawal is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case; the parties must come out openly and tell court what Babu had offered the family," Ochoi said.
