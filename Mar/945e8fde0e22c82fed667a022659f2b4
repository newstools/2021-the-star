Acting Health Director-General Patrick Amoth was the first Kenyan to take the vaccine Jab on Friday as the government officially launched the Covid-19 vaccination program. Kenyans will now start receiving their doses from today through the various referral hospitals countrywide. First in line are the 400,000 health care workers as well as other essential service providers. Second in line for receiving the vaccine include teachers and prison wardens. Speaking during the launch, Heath CS Susan Mochache said the Ministry will employ data management and reporting electronic vaccine registry dabbed ' The Chanjo Management Information system'. The digital system which was developed by experts from the ministry of ICT is said to help the ministry of health in vaccine traceability and ensuring that stocks are professionally managed. "It will track and manage vaccination schedules. It helps in the routine, reporting and addressing any adverse effects and will provide us with reports which we will use for decision making and policy keeping," Mochache said. The first batch of the Astrazeneca vaccine which arrived in the country on Tuesday night is enough doses for 1.25 million Kenyans. On Thursday, President Uhuru Kenyatta officially flagged off the countrywide distribution of the vaccine at National vaccine stalls in Kitengela. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said on Tuesday that once frontline workers are done with, those with comorbidity will be considered before the vaccination process is finally rolled out to the general population. The CS maintained that the vaccination process will be strictly voluntary. "This is purely a voluntary process and not mandatory as alleged. There are those who would wish not to be vaccinated but we hope it will be a majority of them willing to be vaccinated," he said.
