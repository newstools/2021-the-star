The government has been urged to suspend the referendum and use the money to cushion Kenyans who are starving and suffering because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking at East Africa Church of God Kima Mission, Archbishop James Opunde said the referendum should not be treated as a necessity. “Most Kenyans might die of hunger instead of the pandemic,” Opunde said. He said there is no need to spend money on a referendum while people go hungry. The cleric said most Kenyans have lost their jobs and businesses and need to be supported at the moment. Opunde also wants the government to give Kenyans tax relief. His sentiments come a few days after ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi urged the government to withdraw the three percent tax imposed on small and medium businesses.
