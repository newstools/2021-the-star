Kisumu, Siaya, Migori, Homa Bay, Kisii and Nyamira counties will share 54,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine in the first phase of the roll-out. The vaccine for the Nyanza region arrived Thursday night at the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency warehouses in Kisumu. The warehouse is located along the Kisumu Busia Road next to the Kisumu International Airport. Kisumu has 15,000 doses, Homa Bay (9,000), Kisii (9,000), Migori (9,000), Nyamira (6,000) and Siaya (6,000). Kemsa warehouse manager Denis Otieno said they had sufficient cold room storage for the vaccine. Otieno said that the counties will  receive half of the doses allocated to them in the first phase of distribution and the rest later. "The vaccines will be available at specific county referral hospitals once they reach the counties," he said. Nurses, doctors, laboratory technicians and other persons working in health facilities will be the first to be vaccinated.
