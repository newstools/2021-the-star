Thirty-five long and middle-distance runners in Eldoret on Friday received a Sh2.4 million cash boost from the National Olympic Committee of Kenya to aid their training for the Tokyo Olympics. Handing over the cheque, NOC-K president Paul Tergat expressed optimism the financial support will push the athletes to their highest level in training and enhance the committee's objective of sending a strong Team Kenya to Tokyo. “As NOC-K, we want to send a strong team to the Olympics Games and we have just a few months left for the show. We saw it wise to support some of the probable athletes in a small way as we wait for more funding from the Ministry of Sports,” Tergat said. Tergat promised that the same support will be extended to other individuals or teams who have qualified for the quadrennial event to enhance the chances of a medal haul. “We have been losing unnecessarily but this time we have to get it right. Since it is my first event since I got into the office, I will be happy to see the team that will be selected to represent Kenya bag more medals than before,” he said. On hand to receive the cheque were Olympic-bound marathoners Lawrence Cherono and  Amos Kipruto. Kipruto urged the athletes to focus on their training and repay the country's faith in them with podium finishes. “As young athletes, we want to emulate the great sportsmen and women who set the pace for us. We have to work as a team to kill the monster of doping that has cropped in our country,” Kipruto said. Accompanying Tergat was Team Kenya's general team manager Barnaba Korir who urged the athletes to think about their legacy even as they focus on winning many races. “We have come a long way with Tergat and other sportsmen and women in this country. We are here healthy because we used to run a clean sport unlike some athletes who wanted to use shortcuts to earn money,” Korir said.
