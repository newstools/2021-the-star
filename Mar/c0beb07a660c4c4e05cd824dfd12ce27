Spain-based centre Mercy Wanyama is among top players on the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) probables list for the FIBA Afrobasket Women Championships. KBF competition secretary Joseph Amoko said Wanyama is one of 10 diaspora-based players on the federation’s radar as they seek to raise a formidable team for the continental championship, whose date is yet to be determined. “We are keenly looking at the top girls out there for the AfroBasket and Mercy is one of them. Once we identify the best, we will call them for training,” Amoko said, adding that they are also monitoring US-based Felmas Koranga, Olivia-Nelson Ododa and Clara Rotich. During the previous tournament in Dakar, Senegal in 2019, Kenya failed to win a single match and will look to erase this poor record. Mercy, the younger sibling of football stars MacDonald Mariga and Victor Wanyama is enjoying top form at her Spanish side — AD Cortegada. “I signed for a season with an option of extending the contract for one more,” confided Wanyama who turned out for ABDA last season. In her recent outings, Wanyama scored 14 points and pulled down eight rebounds in 25 minutes of play in a 58-40 win over Arxil Pontevedra. She also posted a similar scoreline tallying another 14 that went with eight rebounds in a 72-61 triumph over Rioja. Before her European sojourn, Wanyama guided Equity Bank to their first league championship in 2016 and was named MVP.
