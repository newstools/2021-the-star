The government has dismissed a section of legislators and judges calling for the lowering of the minimum age of consent for sex. Labour and Social Protection CS Simon Chelugui on Wednesday further warned parents whose teenage children go missing without proper explanation that they risk being arrested and fined. He spoke during the launch of a report by National Gender and Equality Commission in partnership with Plan International. Chelugui said it is not in the interest of the children to have the age of consent for sex lowered. The CS said the Ministry in consultation with other stakeholders have recommended an amendment of the Children’s Act 2001 which will soon be presented to Parliament. Chelugui blamed parents for abandoning their role of guiding their children therefore burdening teachers with instilling values. “I urge Kenyan parents to take responsibility for their children and bring them up with strong moral values,” he said. He added, “Families should take center stage in protecting children." The CS also urged parents to join the government in taking teenage mothers back to school rather than punishing them. “Abuse against children is on the rise and we must all play our roles actively to address the issue,” he said. The report titled 'Minimum age of consent for sex; Addressing the dilemma' features voices of children aged between 10-17 who recommend that the age of consent for sex remains at 18 and above to help address teenage pregnancies and child abuse.
