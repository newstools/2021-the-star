Actress Yasmin Said aka Maria says having a boyfriend is not a priority in her life, right now. Speaking on Churchill Show, Maria said having a boyfriend at her age is haram, basing on the fact that she is Muslim and, therefore, she is fully focused on her craft. "I’m just a teen na mambo mengi sio priority kwangu. Halal ni mpaka wewe uolewe, uwe na mume wako bure haya mambo mengi ni kuzini (fornication)," she said. "So mambo na boyfriend, hapana. Having a boyfriend leads to so many things in this life. And ukiwa mtu mzima you know what is wrong and what is right. There are some things you don’t want to happen to you and then it’s all fun and games ikiwa tu mkifurahia, lakini sometimes you don’t know the outcome." During the interview, the young actress urged well-wishers to support her initiative 'Jiamini', which she runs with the support of Indomie Kenya to mentor young talents. Asked who is mentoring her, Maria said she looks up to many people and Brenda Wairimu is her mentor. "She has been in the industry, done so many things, but as for me ndio nimeingia industry and I want to perfect act and everything. And when I saw vipindi zenye amekuwa. Anachapa role mpaka unajiuliza huyu alienda shule ya acting ama ni talent tu. Sometimes I do put myself in her shoes." Her advice to young girls is that they should believe in God. "He will do everything for you, so just believe in yourself, be determined and be focused. And know what you want in this life."
