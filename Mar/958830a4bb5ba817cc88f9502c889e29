Interior CS Fred Mmatiang’I has issued an order prohibiting disco matanga in Trans Nzoia county with immediate effect. The CS toured the county on Monday to inspect security and development projects accompanied by Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa. The projects include ongoing construction works by Kenha of Kitale-Endebess-Suam Road, which is at 59 per cent completion. The road will ease transportation of people, open up the area for local trade and cross border business and enhance connectivity between Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and DRC Matiang’i raised concern over the surging cases of teenage pregnancies and has directed chiefs and assistant chiefs to enforce strict compliance with the directive. At the same time, Matiang’i ordered for investigations and the immediate arrest of adults responsible for teenage pregnancies in the county, whose cases stand at 10,000 and are the highest in the country. The ban comes a day after the Budalangi disaster management and security committee banned disco matanga to curb rampant defilement cases. The move came after a 17-year-old girl was raped and killed in the neighbouring Funyula constituency, Buais County. The committee members convened last week Thursday at the sub-county headquarters and resolved to ban disco matanga in the area. Deputy county commissioner said they have banned the night discos popularly known as disco matanga to protect girls from rapists.
