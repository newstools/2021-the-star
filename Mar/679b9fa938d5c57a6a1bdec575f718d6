Harambee Stars striker Michael Olunga has admitted to his profligacy in front of goal during Thursday night’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Egypt at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Stars drew 1-1 with the Pharaohs to see their chances of qualifying for the continental championship go up in flame. The normally prolific Qatar-based hitman was guilty of missing a glut of chances especially failing to guide home a cross from Eric Ouma. “Unlucky with the chances yesterday but proud of how the team responded especially after the early setback. Good outing especially from Erick ‘Marcelo’ Ouma and  Dan Sakari,” posted Olunga. Ouma and Sakari were particularly impressive with the latter putting in a shift on his debut appearance for the senior national team. As usual, Ouma was given the onerous task of keeping the deadliest opposition player quiet and he did not fail. The former Gor Mahia left-back ensured Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah did not have a chance to wreak havoc despite Stars playing the last quarter of an hour following the dismissal of Johnstone Omurwa. Stars leave for Togo on Saturday ahead of their dead-rubber final tie against the hosts. Egypt and surprise package Comoros have booked their place for the finals set for Cameroon next year. The tournament will be the maiden appearance for Comoros.
