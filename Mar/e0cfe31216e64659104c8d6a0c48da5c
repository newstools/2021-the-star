President Uhuru Kenyatta has said the government will begin issuing  title deeds to Juja residents to ward off land grabbers. The head of state addressed the residents after the burial of MP Francis Munyua Waititu on Tuesday. The President had been informed during the burial the former MP had fought hard against land cartels. President Kenyatta said the government will fast-track construction of a land registry in Juja town to facilitate issuance of title deeds. “I promise the work started by Wakapee will be fulfilled. We will issue residents with title deeds so we can put an end to the rampant  land grabbing,” the President said. Unscrupulous individuals with deep pockets have been colluding with rogue officials of the Kiambu county government and the Ministry of Lands to process fake ownership documents for land belonging to innocent residents. Grabbed land includes public land set aside for for schools, police posts, hospitals, social halls and recreational facilities. Kiambu Governor James Nyoro who accompanied the President said his administration is working closely with the Ministry of Lands to solve land cases. “I’ve reached out to Lands CS Farida Karoney, and together with the ministry, we will begin sorting out the land-buying companies in Kiambu. In this way, we can end the mess in matters land ownership,” Nyoro said. Last month DCI boss George Kinoti said detectives were being trained in matters of land fraud, adding his officers will pitch tent in Juja to tackle the land grabbers and fraudsters. He said cases were on the rise in Juja and threatened many residents. Kinoti spoke in Juja town when he opened the Juja DCI offices. He also warned police officers aiding conmen, saying they will suffer [from reduced benefits] when they retire. President Kenyatta also promised Juja residents their water shortage would soon end when the Sh24 billion Kariminu II Dam is completed.
