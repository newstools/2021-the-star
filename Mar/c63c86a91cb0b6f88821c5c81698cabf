Comedian Eric Omondi was arrested on Thursday following combined efforts between the police and the Kenya Film Classification Board. According to the KFCB, Omondi was arrested for violating the provisions of the Films and Stage Plays Act Cap 222 of the Laws of Kenya by producing and distributing unauthorised films dubbed "Wife Material." He will be arraigned in court for contravening the law. The Board said it will take all possible legal means to curb production and exhibition of unauthorised films on any platform meant for public exhibition. "Protection of children from exposure to harmful content remains our core mandate and any artist producing any content for public consumption must ensure that they comply with the provisions of the Films and Stage Plays Act Cap 222 of the Laws of Kenya," KFCB CEO said. The Films and Stage Plays Act Cap 222 provides that: (1) No person shall exhibit any film at an exhibition to which the public are admitted or distribute such film unless he is registered as an exhibitor or distributor by the Board and issued with a certificate. (2) No film or class of film shall be distributed, exhibited, or broadcast, either publicly or privately, unless the Board has examined it and issued a certificate of approval in respect thereof.Â  (3) Any person who exhibits any film in contravention of the provisions of subsection (1) or subsection (2) shall be guilty of an offence.
