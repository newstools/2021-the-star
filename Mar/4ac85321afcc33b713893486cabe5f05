World football governing body, FIFA, has prohibited Kenyan top tier side AFC Leopards from signing new players for the next two transfer windows. Fifa cracked the whip after Leopards failed to comply with a 45-day ultimatum issued earlier in the year requiring them to settle Sh1.8 million debt owed to Rwandan midfielder Vincent Habamahoro. "We take due note that in its correspondence, he (Habamahoro) informs us that the (AFC Leopards) has not complied with its financial obligations in accordance with the decision of Fifa," read a letter to the club obtained by Goal. "We wish to inform the parties that a ban from registering new players internationally has been implemented by Fifa at the beginning of the next registration period. "Moreover, and in accordance with point 9 of the aforementioned decision, debtor's member association (Football Kenya Federation) is requested to implement Fifa's decision at the beginning of the next registration period." However, the suspension will be lifted the moment the matter is redressed to the satisfaction of the all the involved parties. Habamahoro deserted the den for Kiyovu Sports of Rwanda in December 2018 — barely four months into his contract — after toiling the entire period without wages. And after unsuccessfully knocking incessantly on the club's door to have his debt offset, Habamahoro turned to Fifa for final help that prompted the ban. The decision might not, however, serve much to deter the club's urge for a title this season with their fortunes seemingly improving of late. Ingwe are currently placed third on the FKFPL log with 29 points after the round 16 fixtures with two games still at hand. They boast of an impressive run so far this campaign, having clinched nine wins, been held twice and lost thrice.
