Singer Justin Bieber is set to drop his sixth album, titled 'Justice'. Taking to social media, Bieber said, "In a time when thereâ€™s so much wrong with this broken planet, we all crave healing and justice for humanity." His goal for the album is to make music that will provide comfort and that people can relate to and connect to so they feel less alone. "I know I cannot simply solve injustice by making music, but I do know that if we all do our part by using our gifts to serve this planet and each other, that we are that much closer to being united," he said. "This is me doing a small part. My part. I want to continue the conversation of what justice looks like so we can continue to heal."
