Google’s philanthropic arm, Google.org, has announced Sh2.7 billion ($25 million) in cash grants for the Google.org Impact Challenge (GIC) focused on women and girls’ economic empowerment in Africa. The cash grants will be given to non-profits and social enterprises to enable them create pathways for women to achieve their full economic potential and thrive. These enterprises have until Friday April 2 at 11.59pm GMT to submit their applications at g.co/womenandgirlschallenge. An all-female panel of expert Google executives, world leaders, researchers, educators, business leaders, entrepreneurs, activists and more will preside over the application review and selection process. Agnes Gathaiya, Google Kenya country director, says they are looking for applications from organisations that advance all-round economic empowerment. This is on programmes that address systemic barriers to economic equality, cultivating entrepreneurship, developing financial independence and more. Each beneficiary will receive funding ranging from Sh32.8 million ($300,000) to Sh219.3 million ($2 million), with each organisation selected receiving capacity building support and mentoring from Googlers. “We have a collective responsibility to ensure that generations of women and girls from all walks of life live in a world where they are treated equally and can realise their full potential.”
