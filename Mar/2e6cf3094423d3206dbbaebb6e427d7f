Politicians will no longer be allowed to address mourners in burials in Kisii. The decision was arrived at by elders and church leaders. "We want the dead to be given decent send-off and priority given to their families, not people who don't know anything about the deceased," said Council of Elders chairman James Matundura. He addressed journalists at the elders' offices in Kisii on Wednesday. The forum was attended by representatives from the Seventh-day Adventist and Anglican churches. The move follows the fight between South Mugirango MP Sylvanus Osoro and Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati at a burial in Tendere, Bomachoge Chache a month ago. Going forward, funerals will now end at 1pm and not 3pm. Families will eulogise their dead from 9am after which pastors will be given time to preach and comfort the bereaved. "The church has a special place especially in giving spiritual comfort and thus the need for pastors to be given adequate time to do their work," said Matundura. Politicians have been asked to find their own platforms to sell their agenda. The elders have also barred politicians from ferrying goons to funerals. "We have seen incidents where politicians hire youth to cheer them at the funerals," Matundura said. "This is un-African and distasteful...[it's not] who we are as a people." He said the code will be circulated to all leaders and security agents. "We have already begun circulating this to all our leaders," he said.
