Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo has called upon his cabinet ministers to leave politics to him and focus on their duties. Nyaribo spoke in his office on Friday after he witnessed the swearing in ceremony of four ministers after they were approved by the county assembly on Thursday. The four  are Jones Omwenga (Transport), Stephen Onwong’a (Trade), Emily Ongaga (Finance) and Thomas Nyariki (Public Service). The others are Samuel Maiko (Lands), Gladys Momanyi (Health), Perris Mong’are (Agriculture), Harrison Momanyi (Education) and Dr Grace Nyamongo (Gender and Social Services.) who had occupied their offices earlier. The assembly failed to discuss the nominee for Environment, Water and Natural Resources Cliff Ogwara and he was not sworn in. The county boss cautioned those who want to be a stumbling block to his leadership, saying he will do everything possible to ensure the residents of Nyamira benefit from his leadership as he promised them immediately he took over as the governor. “We are working for the people of Nyamira county and hence we should not expect any form of hindrance from anyone who has a negative mind about our people. Those who think we have time to listen to their cheap criticism should give us a break,” Nyaribo said. Nyaribo urged the CECs to perform their duties without fear of anyone. “All that you need to focus on is only service. Do not fear, be brave as the lion. All that pertains to politics should be left to me,” Nyaribo said. Edited by Henry Makori
