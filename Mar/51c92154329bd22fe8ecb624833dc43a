The Taita Taveta County is seeking partnership with the Moi International Airport (MIA) management in Mombasa to strategise on the re-opening of the Ikanga Airstrip in Voi. According to Taita Taveta Trade and Tourism Executive Vumi Ringo, the Ikanga airstrip is 98 per cent complete and is set to boost tourism sector in the region. The executive on Thursday led a delegation of top county officials in a consultative meeting with MIA management to cement new partnerships on the operation of the county’s first airstrip. “This is an important infrastructure in our county. Its operationalisation will significantly boost the number of people travelling to the region,” she said. Vumi said that the county is keen to develop and build flight transport network with other airstrips across the country. She lauded the MIA management for spearheading formation of strategies that will oversee the functioning of the airstrip, further noting that the airstrip will open up the county to outside market. "It will be a game changer in terms of business. This is reflected by the 62 per cent of Tsavo East and Tsavo West National Parks that cover Taita-Taveta County, making it a tourist destination," said Vumi. MIA regional manager Peter Chikombe said the airstrip will attract local and international tourists. He said construction work at the airstrip was in final stages and that it shall be operationalised by mid this year. "The two per cent of works remaining covers the construction of washrooms, airstrip shades and the fence," said Chikombe.
