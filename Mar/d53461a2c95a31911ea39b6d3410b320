Gender Based Violence victims have a reason to have hope again after a new clinic, Tumaini Clinic, was launched at Mama Lucy Hospital. The event that took place on Friday, saw distinguished guests getting a tour of the new facility, with Mama Lucy Hospital superintendent Emma Mutio taking guests through the newly launched clinic. International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ) Kenya Chapter President Justice Agnes Murgor and Nairobi Metropolitan Services Director Mohammed Badi were among the distinguished guests who graced the event. Males aged between 18 and 33 years are the main perpetrators of gender-based violence, a report has revealed. The report by the National Crime Research Centre indicates that this cluster of youth are in a family or intimate partner relationship context. The report on the State of Crime across the country further indicates that 71 per cent of the 2,416 cases of GBV (that is, 1,716 cases) reported between January and June 2020 were female victims. This indicates that at least 10 females are victims of gender-based violence on a daily basis. The report said these victims are majorly girls, women and children. Alcohol, drug and substance abuse, poverty, family/ domestic disputes and retrogressive cultural (including religious) beliefs and practices and male dominance (including undermining masculinity) remain the main factors contributing to these forms of violence. Other factors include poor parenting/upbringing and moral decadence, identity crisis among the youthful population and inadequate support system.
