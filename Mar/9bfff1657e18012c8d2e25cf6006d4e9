Authorities in Garissa have destroyed 26 gambling machines valued at over Sh700,000 that were seized in December last year and January. County commissioner Meru Mwangi led Kenya Revenue Authority officials to oversee the destruction of the machines at the Garissa dumpsite. Mwangi said illegal betting shops running the machines had been targeting schoolchildren following schools' closure due to Covid-19. “I want to send a very strong warning to those still operating these gambling machines in the backstreets that the long arm of the government will eventually catch up with them,” Mwangi said. “This time round we shall also go for the owners and ensure they are arraigned.” Mwangi attributed the success of the operation to seize the gambling machines to the cooperation between security agencies. Two years ago, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, directed regional and county commissioners to crack down on illegal gambling activities. He ordered for a raid of premises and confiscation of unlicensed gambling machines. The CS also warned foreigners operating unlicensed gambling entities that they would be arrested and deported to their countries.
