Oscar award winner Lupita Nyong’o is the executive producer of 'Super Sema', a YouTube original series. This is the first kid's superhero animated series in Africa.

Our new YouTube Originals series is Africa’s first kid superhero animated series,” read a statement on Kukua’s social media. Kukua’s mission is to empower children of the 21st century with the skills and capacity to dream beyond what they think is possible and to imagine and create a better world. “This mission brought to life Super Sema, a young African girl who uses creativity, determination and steam powers to change the world.” The statement continues to read, “Lupita embodies all that Super Sema represents, so it really is a dream come true for us to have her on our team.” Lupita will voice a special guest character in the series and will be the voice of the official trailer. "This is Sema, an extraordinary African girl on a mission to change the world with the power of determination, creativity, science and technology!" wrote Lupita on Instagram. This comes just days after Lupita announced that her kid's book 'Sulwe' is going to be an animated Netflix movie. "Thank you to the readers of all ages who have joined Sulwe on her starry ride. I’m so excited for this next adventure," she wrote.
