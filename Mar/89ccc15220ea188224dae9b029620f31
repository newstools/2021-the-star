Candidates in terror-prone areas of Lamu have been assured of security as they write their KCSE exams. There at least 100 KCSE candidates sitting their exams in Kiunga, Mkokoni and Kiwayu situated on the Lamu-Somalia border. The assurance equally applies to candidates sitting their exams in other remote areas in the region. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia said adequate security measures are in place to ensure all KCSE candidates sit their exams safely and smoothly. He said enough security had been concentrated in schools on the Lamu-Somalia border to ensure candidates and their invigilators are safe. Macharia said enough security officers had been deployed to man all sensitive and vulnerable exam centres in the region. He spoke when he opened the exam container in Lamu town on Friday. Lamu has a total of 30 exam centres, with 1,694 candidates sitting their exams this year. “As far as security is concerned, we are on top of things. The schools on our border with Somalia, have nothing to worry about," Macharia said. The commissioner urged all candidates and invigilators to adhere to all Covid-19 protocols. He warned that his office shall treat mercilessly any suspected cases of cheating in the exams. “Sanitise and wear your mask always. Stay clear from any form of cheating because when we catch you, we shall treat you without any pity. You won’t like it," Macharia warned.
