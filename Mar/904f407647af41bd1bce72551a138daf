Women Division One side,  Bunyore Starlets' dream of clinching the Football Kenya Federation Women's Cup after claiming the scalps of top tier sides Nakuru West Queens and Oserian Ladies to reach the quarter-finals of the domestic cup competition. Coach Zacharia Amakhang'a believes winning the trophy will attract sponsors and provide his players with big-money moves locally and abroad. "This achievement will uplift the team's status and market the team and players both locally and internationally. Our performance has inspired confidence and injected belief into the playing unit that nothing is impossible," Amakhang'a said. They are the only lower-tier side left in the competition after dispatching both of their erstwhile opponents through post-match penalties. Formed in 2015, the Vihiga County-based side have no sponsor and depend on well wishers for survival. Regardless, Bunyore are unbeaten in Zone B of Division One, having conceded only once in six matches and subsequently, top the nine-team log with 18 points — six points ahead of second-placed Solasa Stima Queens. The gaffer has urged his charges to maintain the tempo even as they seek an unlikely double. "Our dream is to play in the WPL next season. We are working towards promotion which is firmly in our own hands but I call for discipline and focus because we are still in the early part of the season," Amakhang'a said. Juliana 'Messy' Kaupe  and winger Shirlyne 'Live-wire' Onjote have scored six and four goals respectively to rank third and fourth in the goal-scoring charts. Amakhang'a is eyeing new signings in the midfield and attack to boost their title charge. "Two strikers will help us freshen things up because the team is reliant on Kaupe and we have no replacement. The same number of midfielders is required. We are defensively resolute but one more will make us tough to break down. At the moment, we lack bench power."
