Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Premier League outfit Kakamega Homeboyz are hoping to bounce back  when thry host defending champions Gor Mahia on  Wednesday at Bukhungu stadium. Homeboyz lost 2-1 against former soccer giants AFC Leopards last weekend. Team captain and veteran striker Allan Wanga said he still believes the team has what it takes not only to stop the likes of Gor Mahia but also take their rightful place on the table standings. " It is going to be a tough against the defending champions but I am confident of picking all the three points," he said. He added: “We have had a poor start which remains a concern to all of us including the technical bench and the fans. It's time we woke up from the slumber  and ensured we give our best," he added. “We noted our weak points during AFC Leopards match and I believe we can work with the technical bench to fix them. We must turn a new page in our campaign and take our rightful place," he added. Former national team Harambee Stars player commended coach Nicholas Muyoti for a  job well done and called upon the players to support him and treat every match as a final. “For us to be counted among the best, we must start winning matches. We have a chance to kick-start our campaign and revive our hopes of winning the league through good performance,” said Wanga. Former AFC Leopards star, who netted the consolation goal on Sunday against Ingwe, has warned his colleagues to be wary of wounded Gor Mahia who also lost to Nzoia Sugar. Both teams are going into match having lost their weekend matches with an identical 2-1 margin.
