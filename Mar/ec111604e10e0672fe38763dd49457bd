Small, immature locust swarms have been reported in Nakuru, Kajiado and Samburu counties. The UN has reported that a few immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county, west of Mt Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reported in Kajiado county near the Tanzania border and further north in Samburu county. According to the latest locust update by Food and Agriculture Organisation, control operations are in progress, but some locusts could not be treated as they are near communities. FAO explained that as a result of poor rains in Kenya and Ethiopia, the swarms currently present in both countries are remaining immature and continue to decline due to ongoing control operations. “Without rainfall, the swarms will not mature and breed, thus severely limiting the scale and extent of any breeding this spring. The current situation is likely to continue for the remainder of this month as no significant rains are predicted to fall in northern Kenya, Ethiopia or Somalia,” the locust watch stated. FAO deputy Country Rep Hamisi Williams said the current upsurge is winding down in the Horn of Africa. “This is especially if poor rains limit breeding this spring in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia. Nevertheless, it is essential to increase surveys and sustain current control operations in the affected countries as well as maintain a close watch for any unusual developments,” he said. Williams said in the absence of rainfall, the swarms have remained immature and are awaiting the start of the rains to mature and breed. “So far, these rains have not yet started but showers may occur by the end of this month in some areas that could initiate breeding. Nevertheless, the seasonal predictions continue to call for well-below normal rains this spring, which could severely limit the scale and extent of any upcoming breeding,” he said. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
