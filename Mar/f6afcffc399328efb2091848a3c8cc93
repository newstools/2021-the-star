Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers showered praise on goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel after his string of fine saves helped the team earn a 1-1 draw at Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday. The Danish shot-stopper was beaten by Matej Vydra in the fourth minute but he retained his focus to keep out Chris Wood’s effort and James Tarkowski’s powerful header either side of Kelechi Iheanacho’s equaliser in the first half. Schmeichel, 34, then produced a superb diving save at the foot of the post off an angled header from Wood before denying the Burnley striker once again with a fingertip save to ensure his side came away with a point. “He’s been brilliant for me in my time here, there’s moments where it looks like it’s going to be a goal and he pulls off a save,” Rodgers said. “His concentration and desire to stop the ball going in the net is so good. “He always produces for us, he’s absolutely outstanding when he had to be here. That’s why he’s one of the top keepers at this level.” Leicester, who are third in the standings with 50 points from 27 games, visit Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday.
