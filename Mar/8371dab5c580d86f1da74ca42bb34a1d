Arsenal will be attempting to avoid an unwanted record in this Sunday’s north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur as they try to end a five-match win-less sequence against their old foes. Never in their history have Arsenal gone six successive games against Spurs without a win and the last time they went five in a row was between 1993 and 1996. When the sides met at Tottenham’s stadium in December goals from Son Heung-min and Harry Kane gave Spurs a 2-0 win which put them on top of the Premier League table and left Arsenal 15th. While Arsenal’s situation has improved somewhat since then and they are now 10th, Tottenham’s challenge for the title soon disintegrated and they will start Sunday’s derby in seventh spot, albeit on the back of three successive league wins. With both sides in the last 16 of the Europa League their more likely routes to European qualification, particularly in Arsenal’s case, could be by winning that competition. But that will not take any of the edge off Sunday’s clash at the Emirates Stadium where Tottenham will be chasing a first win in the league at Arsenal since a 3-2 victory in 2010. Victory for Jose Mourinho’s side who have suddenly hit form after a dreadful post-Christmas slump would keep them in touch with the battle for a top-four finish. They have 45 points from 27 games, five less than fourth-placed Chelsea who have played a game more.
