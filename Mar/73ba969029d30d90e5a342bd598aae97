Kenya Forest Service team have attributed their good run in the Kenya Volleyball League to discipline, dedication and hard work. The league returnees are sixth with 10 points in the 13-team league, having won three and lost as many games. Their near-upset against defending champions General Service Unit in a five-set thriller proves they are no push-overs. Coach Wachira Gathweria said his charges are now playing as a team after struggling in the first leg where there was no fluidity in their play. "So far so good. I am impressed with how the players have got their act together. The rhythm and levels of concentration have gone up. The players are indefatigable and we look forward to a better third leg next month (April)," said Gathweria. "It's only right to work towards earning a slot in the playoffs and we are not far away from that. The team can only get better." With no men's league matches this month, Gathweria said the team's focus in training will be on backcourt defence. He observed that this is an area where they have lost many points and must be addressed if their ambitions of climbing up the table are to be realised. "Our backcourt defence is a problem and we need to address is. We have more than a month to take care of this and rectify the errors which have cost the team in the past. Statistically, we have dropped a lot of points on the backcourt," he said. At the same time, the team was dealt a massive blow after middle blocker Stephen Muremi was ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury. Muremi hurt his knee during the first leg in Mombasa in the team's 3-1 loss to Kenya Defence Forces. "It's unfortunate we are likely to miss him for the rest of the season. He's one of the senior players but we will find solutions without him," said Gathweria. However, KFS has something to smile about after the availability of experienced left attacker Blasio Koknya who missed out on the previous leg due to personal reasons.
