Kisii municipal manager Nahashon Ongeri has pledged to restore order after a public outcry over congestion and disorganisation in the streets. Speaking a day after they demolished several stalls in the central business district, Ongeri said they will not relent in their bid to make the town a better place. “The demonstrations will not cow us. Our resolve to remove the hawkers from the CBD is final. These have taken over walkways, parking areas and verandas, making the town chaotic,” he told the Star on the phone. He regretted that hawkers and other businesspeople have taken over all available space spaces. “We want to reduce congestion. Currently, walking or driving in this town is a nightmare. We want to do what has been done in Kisumu by the City Management Board and Nairobi by the Nairobi Metropolitan Services,” Ongeri said. He said those affected will be relocated to Kanyoni Street while others will look for alternative spaces. “Those who rented spaces on verandas will have to look for alternative premises to do their business. This resolve is final.” Ongeri added that those affected were given notice on March 11 to vacate drainage areas, verandas, walkways, and any undersigned public spaces. They had until Thursday last week to vacate. “Failure to do so will attract a stern penalty as well as impounding of goods and towing of motor vehicles, motorcycles, carts and goods found in the said areas at the owner’s expense,” the notice read. Blocked drains have been blamed for floods in Kisii town during heavy rains, leading to huge losses.
