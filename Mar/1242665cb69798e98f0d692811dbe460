Boat operators in Lamu are pleading with the national government to exempt them from Covid-19 regulations to help them stay afloat. They want to be allowed to increase the passenger limit, saying the recent hike in fuel prices has dealt them a huge blow. Currently, boats just like public service vehicles, have been directed to carry only half the normal passenger capacity to ensure social distancing. A normal speed boat that normally carries 11 passengers is now only allowed to carry six. Larger boats with a capacity of 100 plus can only carry 50 or half depending on the size of the vessel. With the hiked fuel prices, the operators complained that they are barely making any profits out of the business. Lamu Boat Operators chairperson Hassan Awadh pleaded with the government to either reduce fuel prices or allow them carry the normal limit. He spoke in Lamu Island on Wednesday. “How can we pay so heavily for fuel and not make any profit out of it? Let the government reconsider and grant us one of the requests so we can stay in business," Awadh said. The operators said they are considering raising boat fares if all other avenues to address the issue fail to bear fruit. “Boats are expensive to fuel and maintain yet we have to survive too and put food on our tables. We shall increase the boat fares," he said. Boda boda operators in Lamu island are equally pushing to be allowed to carry more than one pillion passenger to cope with the high cost of fuel. Lamu has over 5000 boat operators spread across various islands in the archipelago and over 300 boda boda operators in Lamu island. In its monthly review on Sunday, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) announced fuel prices adjustments owing to increased landed cost of importing the products. The prices of super petrol, diesel and kerosene increased by Sh7.63 per litre, Sh5.75 per litre and Sh5.41 per litre respectively.
