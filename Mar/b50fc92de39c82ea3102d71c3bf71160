Tanzania's arrest and jailing of 26 Kenyans last week broke the spirit of good neighbourliness, former National Transport and Safety Agency boss Francis Meja has said. “Kenyans living along the Kenya – Tanzania border have relatives on both sides of the two countries and therefore have a right move freely,” Meja said. He said the Maasai from Tanzania have been coming to sell their livestock in Bissil town without passports. “What has become of our Kenyans who have been crossing the Rombo border to buy food in Tanzania since time immemorial?” Meja asked. The former NTSA boss has announced he will be seeking the governorship in Kajiado next year. He spoke a day after Governor Joseph Lenku crossed over to Tanzania and paid the fine of Sh1 million that the 26 Kenyans, who were mostly women were charged. After they were released by the Tanzanian authorities, the residents crossed over into Kenya through the Illasit border town. Lenku said the Tanzanian jailers had refused to allow breastfeeding women to take in their children for the four days they were behind bars. “This is inhumane. You cannot treat people that way. These are not criminals but people who have been crossing over to Tanzania to buy food items for many years,” Lenku said on Sunday. “Tanzanians are working on farms in Loitokitok and we do not ask for their credentials because we value our neighbours.”
