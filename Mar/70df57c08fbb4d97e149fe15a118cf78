Politicians using inciting language in different forums as the 2022 General Election approaches should be reined in, clerics have said. The National Council of Churches of Kenya said politicians should be very careful so that people do not turn against each other to cause chaos. NCCK secretary general Stephen Kinyanjui said they have begun speaking to worshippers to ensure peace prevails. “We want to speak to worshippers; our members have worshippers in all villages, estates and even towns. We can reach so many people,” he said. Kinyanjui spoke when the NCCK National Executive Council hosted Interior CS Fred Matiang’i in Limuru. The clerics discussed with Matiang'i the conduct of the Building Bridges Initiative campaigns. “We do not want to see chaos, deaths, displacement and other ugly things which are witnessed. We want to campaign for peace,” he said. Matiang’i applauded the clerics for coming up with a strategy of working closely with the government to ensure peace prevails in the country at all times. The CS said the government will support them since it has its arms in all the villages. “We shall do our best to work together with you from the villages since we have officers there. We want to secure our country,” Matiang’i said.  (edited by o. owino)
