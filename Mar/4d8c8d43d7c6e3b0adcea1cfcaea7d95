Three men who attacked an editor with crude weapons and stole her Sh25,000 phone have each been sentenced to 25 years in jail. Erick Wafula, Bonface Kivisha and Samuel Kariuki were convicted on Monday by chief magistrate Joyce Gandani of robbery with violence on January 18, 2018. Michelle Korir was attacked with crude weapons on Convent Drive off James Gichuru Road as she waited for a taxi. They were also armed with a homemade pistol. She suffered wounds to the head. Korir, who works with Story Moja, testified she was waiting for a taxi when three men attacked her. "I had just called a taxi as there were no vehicles to take me to Westlands for an interview when three men suddenly came in front of me," she told Gandani . "I felt a blunt object hitting my head. I looked downwards to save my head and I never saw the weapon. One of the suspects tried to grab my phone. They were in their twenties," Korir said. She told the court  that by the time she was attacked most people had walked away on foot as there were no matatus. She was taken to a private hospital, then sent to the Aga Khan Hospital. The investigating officer also testified but the accused men said they were severely assaulted by police, who denied the accusation. On Monday, Gandani ruled she had considered their mitigation — they were family men and sorry — and sentenced them to eight years in jail. They have 14 days to appeal. (Edited by V. Graham)
