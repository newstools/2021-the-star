Deputy President William Ruto has taken a swipe at the political alliance which has brought together Amani National Congress ANC, Kanu, Ford-Kenya, and Wiper's top leaders. Addressing residents of Port Victoria in Budalang'i on Friday, the DP said some people have united with a purpose to bring him down. He didn't directly name his detractors. “Unajua hawa wangwana wamenipangia sana. Lakini na mimi pia nimejipanga na haitakua hivi hivi (these people have strategised against me, but I have also made my plans),” Ruto said. His remarks come as Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetangula, Musalia Mudavadi of ANC and Gideon Moi of Kanu are expected to camp in Machakos County ahead of the senatorial by-election. The DP said the unity of his detractors will not destabilise his ‘hustler’ movement which will be founded by the common members of the public without discrimination. Ruto is expected to launch projects as he drums up support for his 2022 campaigns. He said that he is the legitimate DP who was elected by Kenyans alongside the president and has the freedom to associate with Kenyans of all levels in the country without any question. The DP said that some of the key projects that the Jubilee administration had promised including housing, manufacturing among others have been derailed by the Building Bridges Initiative project. “We had agreed with the president to set up housing, manufacturing and value addition projects, where the youths will have job opportunities but it delayed as we encountered an 'emergency project' called BBI, which is still going on now,” Ruto said. He added that the government will resume its initial plans once the BBI project is over. Ruto said that in the next year, the government will put more effort with the aim of reducing poverty. “We will set aside Sh1 million to each constituency in the country each year which will be directed to hustlers to boost their businesses.”
