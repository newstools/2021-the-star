Nairobi is now in lockdown with a strict curfew following a 'third wave' of Covid infections. After initial scepticism, around 100,000 people have so far been vaccinated. Now that President Kenyatta and other politicians have been publicly vaccinated, the public is rushing to follow them. The AstraZeneca vaccine is so far the best way to protect yourself. But it is not enough. The vaccine only gives 90 percent protection (after two doses) but there remains a 10 percent chance of catching Covid. So we must continue social distancing, wearing masks and washing hands. Unfortunately some politicians have failed to internalise this. Some members of the Senate and National Assembly are saying that no-one should tell them not to sit in session because of Covid (see P8). They should know better. Many of their colleagues have been hospitalised because they failed to follow the rules. Similarly our Tanzania neighbours seem not to have changed after the death of President Magufuli. Very few people were wearing masks at his burial or the swearing-in of his successor President Samia Suluhu. Let us remain vigilant. Covid is still present all around us.
