The national government through the Ministry of Education has started  distribution of sanitary towels to primary school pupils across the country. Bungoma South subcounty director of education Harguey Ong’ijo said the office has received sanitary towels which are being distributed in different quantities depending on the population of the pupils. "We have received sanitary towels for public primary schoolchildren. The pads are being distributed now,” he said. He said the main challenge they are faced with as an office is the level of poverty as some pupils are forced to share out their pads with their family members and friends who are not in school. Ong’ijo thanked the national government for being consistent in giving out sanitary towels. "There are challenges but one thing I want to thank the government for is that they are consistent in distributing the pads and did not stop even during the Covid-19 break,” he remarked. Bungoma DEB head teacher Olivia Abel, who is in charge of the distribution, said the pads had retained the girls in class. She said the pads are given to girls in classes 5,6,7 and 8 starting with those from very poor backgrounds.
