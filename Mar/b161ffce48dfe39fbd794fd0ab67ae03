President Uhuru Kenyatta on Sunday inspected the Green Park Terminus. Uhuru who was not in company of any state officer, toured around the terminus that is being constructed by the Nairobi Metropolitan Service in aim of decongesting the Central Business District. In an interview last week, NMS Director General Mohammed Badi said Green Park was complete 98 per cent complete with only final touches currently happening. Green Park is among six other bus termini that are currently being constructed by NMS that will officially be pick up and drop off points once matatus are barred from the CBD. Once complete Green Park will host Matatus plying Ngong road route . This not the first time the President has made impromptu visits to projects undertaken by NMS over the past one year. Earlier last week, a video emerged on social media where the President was seen driving from Greenpark Terminus. Last year on October 10, he also visited the NMS built Asphalt plant along Kangundo Road that producesÂ 2,400 tonnes of asphalt per day, enough to recarpet 3kms. On June 2, Uhuru together with ODM Party Leader Raila inspected development projects around the CBD area. Uhuru in the company of Major General Badi commissioned four hospitals in February and water community projects in Nairobi. The hospitals are Kayole-Soweto, Uhsirika, Kiamaiko and Uthiru-Muthua which are among 24 hospitals NMS are constructed . The NMS is in the process of finishing the other 18 hospitals and Mathare- Korogocho health facility in the next two months. He also commissioned Muthua, Kabiria ,Huruma, Kayole-Soweto and Dandora community water projects which are all inclusive of boreholes. The boreholes have been drilled by the Nairobi Metropolitan Service in partnership with Athi Water Works at a cost of Sh 1.7 billion. Uhuru is expected to launch more NMS projects as the Badi lead team continues to work on them.
