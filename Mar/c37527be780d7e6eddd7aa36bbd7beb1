Deputy President William Ruto has cancelled his Kirinyaga tour on  Sunday after the President banned rallies for 30 days to limit the spread of Covid-19. Through his social media platforms, Ruto announced he would suspend his public engagements in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta's directives. “The Covid-19 infection rates have become a serious concern, making it necessary for GoK to take remedial measures to manage and contain the pandemic," Ruto said. "With the President's announcement of containment measures, I forthwith suspend all public engagement until further notice,” he said in a statement. His Kirinyaga host, county Woman Representative Wangui Ngirichi announcenced on her Facebook page that his events would be rescheduled at a later date. “The health and safety of Kenyans is of utmost importance, making postponement prudent," she said. Ruto had scheduled four events in the county starting from 9am at General Kassam Stadium in Gichugu. He was to oversee the handover of a school bus to Kiburia Girls High School. He was then to attend a church service at St Luke's Wang’uru before attending an empowerment programme and launch of the Gisando water project at Nguka Primary School grounds. It will serve five villages. Finally, the DP was to visit St Mary’s Sagana Home for the Elderly. He was to be accompanied by Tangatanga politicians from the Mt Kenya region and other parts of the country. During his national address on Friday, President Kenyatta said violators would be punished, despite their social or political status. Ruto's last visits to Kirinyaga in October last year during his whirlwind tour of  the Mt Kenya region. His visits in the vote-rich bloc, including recent trips to Meru and  Murang’a are considered campaigns to woo the region ahead of the 2022 General Election. (Edited by V. Graham)
