The Aga Khan University Hospital has resumed its vaccination exercise against which is sponsored by the government- after receiving more vaccines from the Ministry of Health. The hospital had said on Wednesday morning that the exercise was suspended following the shortage of jabs. But by evening the same day, the hospital announced the resumption of the exercise after the ministry stepped in with more AstraZeneca vaccine. “We have resumed the Covid-19 vaccination exercise after receiving more doses from the Ministry of Health,” the hospital said. The hospital is issuing the vaccine under the government’s guidelines, including free vaccination to eligible priority groups. The priority groups include healthcare workers, teachers, security agencies, clergy, and persons over the age of 58 years. Those wishing to receive the jab from the hospital are supposed to register at the Aga Khan Primary school by 6am. People who will be turning up for the exercise have been asked to carry their National ID, staff ID, or a letter from the company. In its daily updates of the virus in the country, the ministry warned against the marketing of the Sputnik V vaccine, saying it has only received emergency use authorization, not marketing authorization. This comes as a section of private hospitals have been marketing the vaccine which is being administered for between Sh7,000 and Sh11,000. Sputnik V vaccine has been imported by a private organization and the Russian embassy has said the firm should take responsibility for any challenges associated. DP William Ruto was among the first leaders to take the Sputnik vaccine. President Uhuru Kenyatta took the free AstraZeneca jab.
