Two people were Thursday arrested for posing as National Environment Management Authority inspectors to defraud the public. They have allegedly been using forged environment impact assessment expert credentials to con unsuspecting clients and issue EIA reports. Clients paid based on fake Nema invoices. Nema said the two will be arraigned in Kiambu to face charges of impersonation contrary to Section 382 of the Penal Code. Last year, detectives from the Serious Crimes Unit arrested two Administration Police officers impersonating officials from Nema and the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority. The two officers were in the company of another individual when they were arrested with an undisclosed amount of money. Nema said that such cases rose especially after the ban on plastic bags in 2017. "Some unscrupulous people have used the opportunity to make illegal gains by posing as NEMA officials and going around business centres getting the money they termed as ‘fines’ from business people who they found using the banned plastic bags," the agency said. Nema advised the public to use the authority's county office, the headquarters in Nairobi or call hotlines 0786 101 100 or 0741 101 100 when they want to enquire about or need services.
