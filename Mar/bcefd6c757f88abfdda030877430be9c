The six newly elected judges of the International Criminal Court-ICC are set to be sworn-in next week. A media advisory from the court said the event will be held on Wednesday March 10 in Courtroom I. "Due to COVID-19 restrictions, some of the participants will attend remotely," read part of the advisory. The six are Joanna Korner (United Kingdom), Gocha Lordkipanidze (Georgia), Mar√≠a del Socorro Flores Liera (Mexico), Sergio Gerardo Ugalde Godinez (Costa Rica), Miatta Maria Samba (Sierra Leone) and Althea Violet Alexis-Windsor (Trinidad and Tobago). They will serve for a period of nine years during the nineteenth session of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute. The newly elected judges will take a public oath declaring: "I solemnly undertake that I will perform my duties and exercise my powers as a judge of the International Criminal Court honourably, faithfully, impartially and conscientiously, and that I will respect the confidentiality of investigations and prosecutions and the secrecy of deliberations," the advisory said. Parties to the International Criminal Court last month also elected Karim Khan as the new prosecutor for a nine-year term starting on June 16. Khan was Deputy President William Ruto's lead lawyer at the ICC and also represented former Head of Public Service Francis Muthaura. Khan won a secret ballot against three other candidates by garnering 72 votes, 10 more than the 62 needed.
