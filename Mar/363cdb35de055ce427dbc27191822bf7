Cotu has asked MPs to support the move by Garissa Township MP Aden Duale to illegalize possessing or publishing pornographic content. Duale, in the proposals seen by the Star, wants it made illegal to possess or publish pornography, in any computer system or data storage device. Duale also wants the government, through the National Computer and Cybercrimes Coordination Committee, to block access to porn websites by persons within Kenya. "This is an issue of public health concern and not freedom of speech and or access to information as provided in the Bill of Rights," Secretary general Francis Atwoli said. In a statement on Monday, Atwoli said the production and promotion of pornographic materials have an impact on not just the social well-being of the youth, workers and society at large but also sexual health. "Censorship of pornography will go a long way in also promoting and ensuring workers demonstrate good ethical behaviour at their place of work," he said. Atwoli said the bill was of importance since workers’ safety is a major concern to Cotu and its tripartite partners. The proposed law — to be cited as the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes (Amendment) Act, 2020 — is set for publication and introduction in the National Assembly for consideration anytime this week. It seeks to amend the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act to introduce harsh penalties for any violations. If approved, persons found in possession of pornographic material in their phones or computer devices or publishes the same on the internet — social media platforms — will face a Sh20 million fine or 20 years in jail. Duale’s bill seeks to provide that it would be illegal for any person to produce pornography for the purpose of publication through a computer system.
