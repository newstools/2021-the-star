Gender CAS Rachel Shebesh says she has been battling bipolar disorder and depression. Speaking about mental health, she said bipolar controlled her life and, in the process, she fell into depression. "I have suffered from bipolar for a long time, running my life without me having any control over it, and in the process, I became very depressed," she said in a video shared on social media. "I’m talking about this because there could be someone here sitting and wondering what we are all doing here. It’s not that something is wrong with you, you could be going through depression and depression is treatable and it has medication." The former Nairobi woman representative said her personal struggles cost her personally and politically. "I take medicine for bipolar and I take medicine for depression because when I went into depression, I took my family down, I lost my strength on the ground as a politician just because I did not know, I was not sure and I was not ready," she said. "But from the day I took control of my mental health, bipolar does not control me, it’s just part of who I am."
