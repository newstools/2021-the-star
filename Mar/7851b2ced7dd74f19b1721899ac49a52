Women drive consumer purchase decisions as the primary shoppers for their homes, making 80 per cent of consumer decisions worldwide, a recent survey shows. The study by Ipsos and BSD Group revealed that Safaricom is the most preferred brand by women in Kenya, followed by M-Pesa and Equity Bank. ‘Always’ sanitary pads comes in fourth on the list followed by Naivas Supermarket, Menengai bar soap, Arimis, Airtel, Aerial and Coca-Cola. The two firms undertook a countrywide study early this year of women aged 18-65 to identify the top 100 Kenyan brands loved by them. The study details the key reasons the top100 brands made the list based on the data collected and how women markets contribute to the financial and reputational performance of brands and organisations. “Sixty-nine percent of women play a critical role in the purchase of products or services used in their household and on average, 59 percent of their income goes to this,” said Ipsos managing director Chris Githaiga. Githaiga pointed out that the study will bridge the knowledge and insights gap as far as understanding the female consumer demographic is concerned. “There is huge opportunity as many businesses/ brands actively seek to reach women to draw growth and for valid reasons; women play a critical role in our economy,” said Githaiga. Public Service and Gender Affairs CS Margaret Kobia, highlighted the importance of recognising and promoting women’s active participation in the economy while contributing to their empowerment. Research by McKinsey shows that if women participated in the economy on the same basis as men, it would add $12 trillion, or 11 percent, to the 2025 annual global GDP. Industrialisation, Trade & Enterprise Development CS Betty Maina,noted that women have for long been an integral part of Kenya’s developmental agenda. She encouraged organisations to be intentional in creating products that meet the needs of women.
