Kamiti Maximum Prison and the Langa'ta Women's Prison should be moved out of Nairobi, Interior Security CS Fred Matiang'i has proposed. He suggested they should be moved to Kitale or Bomet. Matiang'i said Industrial Area Prison, Nairobi West Prison and Shimo La Tewa should also be transferred from the city. “Why should we have prisons in the middle of the city when we could use that prime land to develop and increase amenities of the city? " Matiang'i said at the launch of the National Land Commission's 2021/2026 strategic plan on Friday in Nairobi. Kamiti sits in the middle of its own 1,200-acres estates which lie fallow and untended. Lang'ata sits on about 50 acres, after the rest was grabbed. The commission developed the plan to ensure the implementation of its mandate is guided as spelt out in the Constitution, statutory and policy provisions. The commission targets Sh20 billion to make the plan operational. This is the second strategic plan to be implemented after the 2013/2018 plan which has guided the commission so far. It also guided the commission on land disputes and conflict resolution as well as sustainable management and use of natural resources and institutional strengthening. The commission plans to oversight on land use planning and registration of titles. “This is to ensure land use planning forms the basis of all decision making going forward," said Alex Mburi, the Lands and Physical Planning CAS.
