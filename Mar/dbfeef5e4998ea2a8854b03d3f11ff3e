A judge has been asked to block the National Assembly from releasing any funds to the widow of the late Kibra MP Ken Okoth. AMT, who bore a son with the late MP, has filed a case asking for maintenance for the child and an upfront payment of Sh148, 000 which is school fees arrears. AMT says her son needs school fees and upkeep and if the court does not move quickly and order payment of reasonable upkeep, the minor might be discontinued from school. She accuses the widow Monica Lavender of failing to disclose the key assets of the late MP and giving indication of the value of the funds held in his bank account. According to the court papers, despite AMT's lawyers reaching out to the widow she has not informed them about the status of the estate. “Executor (widow) failed to neither disclose in her affidavit a key asset nor indicate the value of funds held in bank, shares held in the sacco nor the value of the pension,” the court was told. AMT is now apprehensive that the widow might disinherit her son and wants the court to intervene. She wants the court to grant order for payment of school fees and reasonable maintenance upon presentation of school fees invoice as and when such are from funds or shares held by the clerk of the national assembly to be deducted from final dues. And when the matter came up in court on March 1 it was stood over because the widow was not in attendance. AMT first moved to court in 2019 seeking recognition of her son as child of the late MP. Following that application three DNA test was conducted and all confirmed that the late MP sired the minor in question. The results showed 99.9 per cent match on samples taken from Okoth’s body and those of the minor.
