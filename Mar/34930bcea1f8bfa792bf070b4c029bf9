The Nairobi City County is set to go after rate defaulters as it seeks to improve its revenue. Already, dozen of houses mainly within Eastlands have been given notices to pay  their rates or risk their property being repossessed and given to the deserving. "You are supposed to have paid up all the rate fees for the plot including any areas owed to the Nairobi City government. The County government Finance Act of 2015 mandates the authority to repossess any property the owner defaults rate payment and re-allocate it to the deserving," part of the notice by County and Kenya Revenue Authority reads. According to the notice, those who have not paid their rates have been urged to make arrangements and pay. The notice comes even as reports indicate revenue collection for the county has improved by 25 per cent to Sh3.9 billion over the last six months last year. The county collected Sh3.1 billion over a similar period last year before KRA took over the revenue collection role. According to the monthly revenue analysis data seen by the Star, KRA collected Sh466.6 million in July, Sh454.9 million in August, Sh604.7 million in September, Sh1.05 billion in October, Sh502.5 million in November and Sh842.8 million in December. Revenue collection improved in most months compared to the previous year. In the 2019-20 financial year, Sh485.5 million was collected in July, Sh413.7 million in August, Sh600.7 million in September, Sh407.4 million in October, Sh428.5 million in November, and Sh808.6 million in December. Despite the improvement, the county failed to meet its monthly targets except for October when Sh1,052,192,437 was collected against a target of Sh1,039,658,080. The county had targeted to collect Sh905.2 million in July, Sh909.7 million in August, Sh979.7 million in September, Sh1.04 billion in October, Sh1.1 billion in November, and Sh1.4 billion in December 2020. Rates generated Sh1.1 billion against a target of Sh1.2 billion. That was the highest collection made from own source revenues. Parking fees generated Sh685.3 million, single business permit Sh470.3 million, building permit Sh321.6 million, billboards and advertisement Sh291.3 million, rent Sh292.9 million, fire inspection certificates Sh54.9million, food handlers certificates Sh50 million, and wakulima market Sh80.8 million. Another Sh101.1 million was collected from other markets with Sh60.8 million from the regulation of building. Other incomes generated Sh433.1 million. KRA was officially appointed the principal county revenue collector on March 16, 2020 as part of the agreement in the deed of transfer of functions of the county to the national government. The taxman was tasked with improving collection. Since the advent of devolution, City Hall has hardly collected Sh10 billion annually. The devolved unit had in 2014 contracted JamboPay to collect revenue on its behalf, but the contract was terminated in June last year. Since the takeover in March, KRA has consistently improved revenue collection on a month-to-month basis. Between March and June 30, 2020, revenue collection was 33 per cent higher than for the same period in the previous year. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted business and greatly contributed to the failure to meet targets. Measures put in place to curb the spread of the virus such as night curfew, cessation of movement and stay-at-home directives disrupted business. Controller of Budget reports show that Nairobi's annual revenue collection has been declining annually. City Hall has never met its revenue targets since 2013. At the same time, the Controller of Budget said the county did not spend any cash in the first three months of the 2020-21 financial year. This was despite the county having an annual budget of Sh31.4 billion with only Sh6.4 billion allocated for development. In the financial year 2021-22, the county seeks to achieve Sh19.8 billion own-source revenue. This is part of the Sh37.3 billion proposed budget for the financial year 2021-22 as highlighted in the County Fiscal Strategy Paper. According to the county treasury, the 2021-22 projection of Sh37.3 billion budget will be funded by own source revenue of Sh19.8 billion and Sh17.3 billion from external sources. The six key own source revenue streams for Nairobi county include parking fees, rates, single business permits, house rents, building permits and, billboards and adverts accounting to close to 80 per cent of the county’s annual own-source revenue. City Hall has set a target for rates at Sh7.62 billion, single business permit Sh2.75 billion, parking fees Sh3.02 billion, building permits Sh1.5 billion, billboard and adverts Sh1.2 billion. Others include markets Sh674 million, fire services Sh453 million, house rents Sh606 million, food handlers certificate Sh250 million, liquor licenses Sh250 million, other income Sh1.48 billion. The county collected the highest amount in 2015-16 of Sh11.71 billion. The lowest was collected last year, 2019-20 at Sh8.5 billion which was half the targeted Sh17.31 billion. Rates were Sh1.89 billion against a target of Sh3.92 billion, single business permit Sh1.58 billion against Sh2.89 billion, and parking fees Sh1.54 billion against Sh2.76 billion. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
