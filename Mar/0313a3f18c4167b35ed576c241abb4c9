The Director of Public Prosecutions has new evidence against Garissa Governor Ali Korane in his Sh233 million graft case. Korane appeared on Monday before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti for the hearing of his case, but the trial did not commence because of the new evidence that the prosecution has. Prosecutor Mercy Gateru told the court they had found new information that they need to supply to the defence before the trial starts. Gateru told the court that in the course of conducting the pre-trial with the witnesses who will testify against the governor, they found out that there was new evidence that will be vital. She asked the court to give them time to supply the evidence to the defence lawyers so they can prepare for the trial. Lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi did not object to the application for adjournment by the prosecution. Ogoti allowed the application by Garetu and directed them to serve the defence with the new information within the next 14 days. The court said Koraneâ€™s lawyers have another two weeks to take instructions from him in order to prepare for the case. The case will resume on April 19. Korane was charged last year alongside four county officials with several counts of corruption. The county boss is accused of misappropriating part of Sh233 million from the World Bank-funded Kenya Urban Support Programme. The five also face another count of wilful failure to comply with the laws relating to the management of funds. Korane was barred from accessing his office by Ogoti last year when he was charged, until the case is heard and determined. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
