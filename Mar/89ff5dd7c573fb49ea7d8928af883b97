Kenya risks missing the sitting volleyball World Cup qualifiers due to an outstanding debt of Sh2.7 million owed to the Africa Para volleyball body. Subsequently, Kenya Sitting Volleyball president Polycarp Mboya has appealed to the government through the Ministry of Sports to help them clear  the outstanding bill to facilitate the team's participation in the event. "I’m making a passionate appeal to the Sports Ministry to settle the debt so that we can return to the International scene,” added Mboya. Kenya is currently suspended by the continental body,  a move Mboya said had spoilt their image and good reputation on the continent. "It is really hurting us but we hope we can salvage it," noted Mboya. Mboya said the country has immense potential and did not want to see the young players missing out on an opportunity to play against some of the best teams in the continent. Mboya has urged branches to resume training after the long break following the Covid-19 pandemic that affected all sporting activities. Mboya said the national elections will be held at the end of this month, preferably March 27-28. “Preparations and the road map will start very soon and we will soon release the schedule,” added Mboya.
