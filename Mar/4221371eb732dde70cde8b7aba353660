ODM leader Raila Odinga has appeared for the first time since contracting Covid-19. In a clip posted on his Twitter account, a fit Raila is seen doing some light exercises outside his home as his daughter Winnie encourages him on. "It's wonderful. It feels so nice to be back home...It was like a prison back there. It's nice to breathe the fresh air and at least see nature," a jovial Raila said. Clad in a full tracksuit, a cap and a mask on, the ODM leader however confirmed he was still in isolation. The ODM leader checked into the hospital on Monday for a series of tests, some of which, according to his Dr Ouma Olunya, confirmed he was positive. In a statement on Thursday evening, Raila said "numerous and complicated tests" on him for the last two days, tests had confirmed an accurate diagnosis of his health status. “I received a briefing from the doctors who have conducted numerous and complicated tests on me for the last two days to arrive at an accurate diagnosis of my health status. “While the tests were several, one important result, which I have authorised the doctors to make public is that I have been found to have been exposed to Covid-19. “Despite the fact that I feel strong and in good shape after a few days in the hospital, I have agreed with my doctors to undertake the mandatory quarantine," Raila said. ODM insiders intimated to the Star that those who interacted with Raila have been asked to take the tests, go into self-quarantine. A number of Raila allies who accompanied him for the tour have taken the tests, of which some were cleared to travel out of the country. About 30 staffers at Raila's Capitol Hill offices have also taken the tests and sent on self-quarantine.
