The Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine is safe and none of its recipients has reported adverse side effects, Health PS Susan Mochache has assured. Mochache said the vaccine has been verified by credible regulatory bodies across the world and rumours about its safety must be ignored by health workers who need protection most. “The vaccination should start with healthcare workers for being frontline soldiers, then support staff, administration and teachers and security personnel,” Mochache said. She spoke on Tuesday at Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital after launching the vaccination of health workers. She asked the Kisii government to ensure that the vaccine reaches healthcare workers and all employees working in hospitals. Governor James Ongwae said that the vaccination shall take place in three phases. The first phase will be for health and other essential workers; the second for people living with underlying conditions such as diabetes, cancer, tuberculosis and HIV. The third phase will target students, prisoners and other members of the public. Ongwae confirmed that Kisii received 4,500 vaccine doses from the Ministry of Health. Director of public health Dr Richard Onkware received the first jab followed by health workers at KTRH.  (edited by o. owino)
