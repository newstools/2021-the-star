The High Court has issued orders staying a decision by the Registrar of Political Parties removing the Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura from the Jubilee Party membership list. Milimani Law Courts Justice Hedwig Ong'udi issued an amended notice of motion dated March 29, under a certificate of urgency where the senator is seeking a stay of execution of the orders of the Registrar of Political Parties Tribunal after his expulsion from the party. Justice Ong'udi said that she considered the application, the supporting affidavit, further affidavit, and the annexures and found the matter to be urgent. “I, therefore, certify it as such. Let the Appeal and Application be served on the respondents immediately.” This comes after the Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu removed the name of the Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura from the list of Jubilee Party members. The court has said that the inter parties hearing of the application shall be on April 15 before any judge in the division. Lady Justice Hedwig Ong'udi said that there shall be a stay of execution of the impugned orders until the hearing of the application. Through SMS ADVOCATES, LLP ADVOCATES, the senator expressed his dissatisfaction with the ruling and orders of the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal delivered and intends to appeal against the whole ruling of the tribunal. Mwaura said that the interim orders that had been issued by the tribunal were vacated by virtue of the dismissal of his application dated February 9, 2021. According to Ann Nderitu, in a letter addressed to the JP secretary general Raphael Tuju, the step was taken pending the adoption and ratification of the same by the party's National Executive Committee. The registrar said that the decision is based on the Party Disciplinary Committee report and its decision dated February 6, 2021, the National Management Committee resolution that was reached on February 8, and The Political Parties Dispute Tribunal ruling that was made on March 26.
