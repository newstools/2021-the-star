The Central Organisation of Trade Unions on Sunday threatened unspecified action over the increased fuel prices. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli called on the Ministry of Energy to address the spiralling cost of fuel. In a press statement, Atwoli said the move is “outrageous and insensitive” saying it is an affront to workers and the rest of the Kenyans. The trade unionist said already, taxpayers are undergoing tough economic times as a result of the coronavirus. Many Kenyans are out of their jobs. The prices of super petrol, diesel and kerosene have increased by Sh7.63 per litre, Sh5.75 per litre and Sh5.41 per litre respectively. A litre of petrol will now cost Sh122.81 in Nairobi, up from Sh115.18 it has retailed at since February 15. Diesel will retail at Sh107.66 per litre up from Sh101.91 a litre while poor households using kerosene for cooking and lighting will part with Sh97.85 to take home a litre of the product, up from Sh92.44. Atwoli noted that the increase in the prices will have an impact on consumer products and could also see the cost of transport shoot up. “They can't afford to pay for their fares to their workplaces. Businesses have equally been hit hard and as social partners, we are putting in all we can to remain afloat yet the Authority comes up with such exorbitant increases to an already overburdened people,” he said. He added, “This is a form of impunity that as workers we will not entertain and call on the President himself to immediately address these concerns because effective tomorrow (Monday), prices on basic commodities will go up as fares will in order to cushion players in these sectors.” He said the cartels that have taken over the oil industry are to blame for the escalating prices, calling for deliberate efforts to reverse the trend. Atwoli said if no drastic action will be taken, more Kenyans will be confined to abject poverty and “will simply run out of options.”
