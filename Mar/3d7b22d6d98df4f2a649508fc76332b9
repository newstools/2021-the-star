Last year’s premier league finalists Thunder have lost key players but coach Sadat Gaya is bullish his team will perform. The tactician warned anyone dismissing his team’s title aspirations this year to do it at their own peril. “It is true I have lost many of my key players who helped us make it to the play-off finals in 2019. But we are still very much the team to beat,” Gaya said. National team forward Faheem Juma and Shem Otieno joined Equity Bank while Ancette Wafula returned to reigning champions Ulinzi Warriors. Fidel Muga moved to the coast, joining Kenya Ports Authority with Pascal Nabwana and Emmanuel Soja returning to Strathmore University. Others who left are forward Kevin Chogo and Benjamin Onea all of who are out of town on job assignments. Thunder, who lost 3-1 to Ulinzi,will have to rally behind national team captain Griffin Ligare, Jackton Agunda, Charles Kituyi and Nate Terry. “The quartet will remain our hope for points again this year. I have also injected young talent into the team and we will soon see how they adapt,” said Gaya. He added, “ I will make some adjustments and we are still very much the team to beat,” said Gaya, who is Morans’ assistant coach. Thunder will start their training today and open their season with a match against Kisumu Lakeside this weekend. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) had no league games as they organised refresher clinic for National Grade 1 and Grade 2 referees. “We had no league matches the past weekend because we want to prepare refs will officiate the league in 2021.”
