Chivas Regal will host its second instalment of the Chivas Afroblend series in partnership with Manchester United. The series, made up of a fusion of music, football and fashion, will connect Manchester United legends, consumers and media personalities through exclusive activities. At the inception of Chivas Afroblend in 2020, consumers and fans were immersed in premium experiences plus special one-on-ones with Man United legends. This year Chivas plans to do things slightly different, incorporating innovative digital connections and exclusive ‘Success is a Blend’ experiences for consumers. Set to kick off from March, the experiences will offer an interactive and tailored brand immersion in Kenya, Cameroon and Zambia, under firm Covid-19 regulations. The heart of the partnership is brought to life through the power of collaborations. The campaign brings together renowned international fashion artists - consultant Annette Pringle Kölsch and African designers Faith Migwi (House of Manciny - Kenya), Chiza Ngulube (House of Esnoko – Zambia) and Imane Ayissi (Cameroon). Each designer will create a collection of premium African athleisure wear as part of a football and Chivas inspired collection, which complements street football culture amplified by Manchester United. Fans will also celebrate the spectacular taste of whisky while creating memorable moments with the Chivas Regal at-home experience. Dwight Yorke will represent the Zambian market, Andy Cole, Kenya, and Louis Saha for Cameroon. Tendai O’Connor, brand manager - Pernod Ricard SSA, said, “Built off a great first year of Afroblend and continue to entrench our platform in the Kenya, Zambia and Cameroon market through delivering the same great experience, just blended differently and all in line with Covid restrictions in markets for the full 4-month duration of our campaign.”
