At least 1,750 households in Umoja slum in Thika will receive title deeds under the Kenya Informal Settlement Improvement Programme. The Kiambu county assembly has approved the physical development plans for the 11.8-acre piece of land. Other slums within Thika subcounty that will get their block title deeds include Gachagi, Matharao and Kiandutu. They are among the seven settlement schemes within Kiambu county that have been pre-qualified for planning and security of tenure and are pending final verification, according to Lands executive Samuel Mugo. Others are Shauri Yako in Dagoretti, Ruthimitu Kiamburi in Kikuyu subcounty and Kibagare in Kiambaa subcounty. Mugo received the 60 block title deeds for the settlement schemes from KISIP’s head of tenure regularisation George Arwa. Mugo said issuance of the title deeds will end land rows within the informal settlements. “It’s a reprieve for residents of the informal settlements who lack proper documents for their land parcels. It will also go a long way to end the long-standing land disputes in the areas,” Mugo said. Umoja residents who spoke to the Star said lack of the legitimate land ownership documents has escalated land rows within the area, adding that it has left a loophole for land cartels to grab parcels belonging to them. “God has finally answered our prayers. We have suffered for long enough in the hands of land cartels who have been encroaching on our land parcels. We are sure that all unscrupulous grabbers will be kicked out of this area,” said resident Joseph Kiarie. Earlier this month, Kiambu Governor James Nyoro said that the county has partnered with the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development to streamline land matters, which he termed as emotive.
