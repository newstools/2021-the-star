The Kenya Medical Supplies Agency and Nandi county are on the spot again after the Auditor General revealed that some Covid-19 supplies are missing. A  review by the Auditor General of dispatch records from Kemsa and receipt records from the county revealed inconsistencies between quantities supplied and those received. The details are contained in a special audit of how counties used billions of shillings disbursed by the government and donors for the Covid-19 fight. “We recommend further investigations be carried out to ascertain possible losses," Gathungu said. Kemsa's dispatch record indicated 104 consignments of masks were dispatched to Nandi but records at the county indicated they received 250 consignments. The audit says 1,000 non-woven masks were dispatched by Kemsa but none of them were received in Nandi. Similarly, 1,585 face shields were dispatched from Kemsa but none was received in Nandi. While 21 consignments of gloves were dispatched from Kemsa, the county records indicate they received 13,500 consignments. Kemsa did not dispatch any sanitiser to Nandi but county records indicate they received 100. Also dispatched from Kemsa were 750 surgical gowns but none was reported receive in Nandi. The report also says 120 pairs of coveralls were dispatched but only 20 were received. A consignment of 240 KN95 masks were also dispatched but Nandi county recorded only 20; 2 ventilators were reported dispatched but none was recorded received. Kemsa did not dispatch any PPE gear but county records indicate they received 15. Nandi county received Sh244  million for Covid-19, including a conditional grant of Sh118 million from the government; another Sh58.5 million from the government for healthcare workers' allowances and Sh30 million from the Kenya Devolution Support Programme. Nandi also set aside Sh32 million from its own funds and received Sh5.9 million from the Danish Development Agency. As at October 9, 2020, the county has used Sh99 million on purchases and allowances. The county is cited for over-spending on conditional grants. Records indicate the county had budgeted Sh2.7 million to purchase full PPEs but ended up using Sh6 million, a difference of Sh3.3 million.S 3.3 million. The county had budgeted Sh6 million to buy surgical masks but ended up using Sh9.1 million, a difference of Sh3.1 million. In total the county had  planned to use Sh8 million on the two items but ended up using Sh15 million. The county also irregularly used Sh1.4 million to procure a heavy-duty printer at Sh896,000 and Sh497,000 to procure HP laptops yet the two items were not listed in the approved procurement plan. The county is alo cited for mixing up Covid-19 funds with the normal Nandi Health department operations funds. “The same cash book was used and hence it was not possible to separate Covid-19 and non-Covid-19  expenditures," the audit report reads. However, a manual review of payment vouchers indicated the county had used Sh41.8 million on Covid-19 activities. The county also paid Sh57.6 million as allowances to 1, 424 frontline health workers in the July 2022 payroll but 276 support staff in hospitals had not been paid allowances amounting to Sh4.1 million at the time of the audit. The special audit also established that the county prepared and submitted to the Controller of Budget a financial report on the use of Covid-19 funds but omitted Sh30 million from the Kenya Development Support Programme.
