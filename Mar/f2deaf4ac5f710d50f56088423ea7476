Zetech University Sparks are eyeing a top three finish in the women’s Premier League, according to coach Maurice Obilo. Obilo said his side had learnt a lot from their loss to Kenya Ports Authority in their opening fixture and will try to improve on the performance. He attributed the defeat to a few mistakes that will be sorted out as the team tries to focus on the next matches. “Since this was only our first game, I know what to correct going forward. We learnt a lot and will gradually pick up,” he said. He said his team's endurance was wanting in the last quarter and that is one reason they lost the duel. Zetech took the former champions to the ropes, leading 24-18 and 8-14 in two quarters before losing 69-55 in the end. “The fact that we didn’t end the game the way we played in the opening three quarters left no doubt that there was a problem with our fitness levels,” he pointed. Obilo noted that the girls had trained well and were all set for the 2020 season before Covid-19 pandemic struck, halting the league. “That break did not do us a lot of good. We had covered so much ground and the team was raring to go,” he said. Sparks national team star Debra Obunga, who was making his first appearance against her old team, said it was a learning experience. “We played well but lost it in the fourth quarter. I believe after four or five games, we will be ok,” she observed.
