Promoted Kenya Cup sides Strathmore Leos and Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology remain confident of a good campaign despite losing their opening two matches. On Saturday, Strathmore Leos fell to a 35-9 defeat to Kabras while Top Fry Nakuru edged MMUST 23-10 in Nakuru. But on Sunday, Leos coach Louis Kisia and MMUST’s Ochieng’ Ahaya exuded confidence that their teams will turn the tables when they enter matchday three this weekend. In separate interviews, the two coaches said their teams had improved from their first matches. MMUST lost 56-0 against neighbours Kabras while Leos lost 16-24 against multiple Kenya Cup champions KCB in their opening matches. “I believe we played better than in our first match. Playing against KCB and then Kabras is not an easy task. These are big teams and many people expected them to thrash us but we managed to offer some resistance,” said Kisia. “We have so far proved our mettle.  We lost those two games in the last 20 minutes ad we are going to work on that ahead of the next game against Nondies.” “The sporting world is unfair and unpredictable, however, we are going for nothing short of a win against Nondies,” said a confident Kisia. Ahaya said despite the baptism of fire against Kabras, his charges played a better game against Nakuru. “Statistically, we are not badly off. We are still acclimatising and learning the ropes. We shall catch up with the rest of the teams in due course,” said Ahaya. He said his team is transitioning well from Championship but regretted that they did not have an opportunity to strengthen since they qualified to the top tier league after the transfer window had expired. The teams remain 10th and 11th on the log without a point while Kabras lead the log with 10 points, same as second-placed KCB.
