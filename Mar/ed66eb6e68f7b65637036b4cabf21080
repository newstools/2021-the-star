Nigerian Afropop superstar Kizz Daniel has released his new single, 'Flex'. The thumping single is a befitting homage to the legendary Fela Kuti. The black-and-white video revisits a popular nightclub that hosted performances by the Afrobeat icon, famed for brisk and exhilarating dance tunes. Kizz Daniel previously worked with seasoned producer DJ Coublon on several singles, including ‘Duro’ off his debut album 'New Era', and the remix to his hit single ‘Woju’ featuring Afrobeat superstars Davido and Tiwa Savage. Kizz has kicked off what promises to be a good year in music with the feel-good anthem, reminiscent of sounds from his sophomore 2018 album ‘No Bad Songz’, and a follow-up to the success of his most recent ‘King of Love’ 2020 album.
