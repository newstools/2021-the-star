The Jennifer Riria Foundation in collaboration with Master Made Studios presents the first-ever Lioness Awards. The awards, which will be given out annually, are meant to celebrate exemplary women who have defied the odds and broken systemic barriers in their fields of expertise and passion. The inaugural edition will take place on Saturday at the Serena hotel. The edition is centred on this year’s International Women’s Day themes #ChooseToChallenge, and #WomenInLeadership. The awards championed by Dr Jennifer Riria will recognise women 35 years and younger in arts and entertainment, leadership and governance, media, social impact and entrepreneurship. Speaking about the awards, Denise Kemunto, the foundation’s CEO, said; “This is the first award ceremony of its kind, and we as JRF have chosen to reward outstanding lionesses for their role in breaking the glass ceiling and inspiring younger ladies to do the same.”
