The Constitution stipulates issues that must be subjected to a referendum if they are to be amended. This is regardless of whether Parliament endorses them or not. The question, therefore, is whether there are issues in the BBI that fall within the category of the 10 issues that the Constitution envisages under Article 255. When I look at the BBI, I see a number of issues that either directly or constructively fall within this category. I have seen in some places people interpret the 10 issues to mean it has to be the particular article, which if has to be amended, then a referendum is required. But there is also a way of looking at these issues in a constructive manner. The independence of the Judiciary, for example. If you touch on the Judicial Fund, somebody may argue that you have interfered with the independence of the courts. This is because the fund is meant to help this arm of government function independently. You may, therefore, find proposals that, constructively, can be argued to touch on the very 10 issues under Article 255. There is also the political question beyond the technical issues. There is the promise made by the proponents over the last three years. They took Kenyans through a journey that they will eventually decide at a referendum. It would be a big political con game if Kenyans do not go to a referendum. Kenyans were made to believe they would decide on the document. They will feel duped to be told later that they do not have a role to play in the final BBI process. Not subjecting the BBI to a referendum is a proposal that may technically go through but will lack legitimacy. A referendum is proposed in such ventures to ensure there is public legitimacy. It is also to affirm what the Constitution says—that sovereignty belongs to the people. These are the issues that need to be looked at if a different path is to be taken.
