Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony has led county leaders in mourning the death of Deputy Governor Susan Kikwai. Chepkwony on Saturday eulogised Kikwai as a dedicated and a true deputy who helped serve the people of Kericho. "She is the best deputy Kericho has ever had... she was a true assistant, meticulous, honest and cooperative," he said during a press briefing at CoG headquarters in Westlands. Chepkwony said the county is in contact with the family to make burial arrangements. The governor confirmed that his deputy succumbed to Covid 19. Chepkwony urged the public to be cautious, saying that the third wave of the virus has proved more lethal and dangerous than the previous ones. Kikwai had been undergoing treatment at Siloam Hospital. Earlier, President Uhuru Kenyatta sent a message of condolence to the family, the governor and residents of Kericho county. The President described the departed county leader as a devoted public servant who was deeply committed to the wellbeing and progress of the Kenyan nation. Kikwai was serving her second term, having first been elected in 2013. She was the daughter of the one-time Kipkelion constituency MP Wiliam Kikwai.
