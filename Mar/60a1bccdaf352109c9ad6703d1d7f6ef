The Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kericho has dismissed a case filed by an adviser of former Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama. Job Ong’ombe had filed a petition on January 27, 2021, seeking to remain in office until next year. But Justice Hellen Wasilwa in her ruling on March 16, dismissed the application, saying it lacked merit. "I find the application without merit and dismiss it accordingly,” Wasilwa ruled. She said the employment of the petitioner solely relied on Nyagarama. Nyagarama died in December last year. “I note that the applicant was appointed as an adviser to the late governor. The position in my view was premised on the life of the said governor. In the circumstances, I find the applicant has not established a prima facie case with any chances of success." This is a reprieve to Governor Amos Nyaribo as the petition was among the many he was a respondent. Nyaribo took over as the county boss early this year after the death of his predecessor Nyagarama.
