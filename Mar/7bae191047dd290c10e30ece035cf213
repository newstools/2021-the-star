Croatia vs Cyprus Saturday 8pm This should be an intriguing matchup considering both sides will be looking to go through to the main competition. There has only been one recorded game between these two teams in the past, and that was won by the home team Croatia. This particular encounter came way back in September 2014 in an international friendly. Saturday’s game might unlock the shackles of the home team Croatia, who fought against all odds to become the runners up of the 2018 Fifa World Cup, which was played in Russia. Zlatko Dalic and his men have a rather uphill task in terms of securing their place in the World Cup competition. Based on recent form, it’s not looking the most positive for them. Dalic has an almost full-strength squad for this competition save for Ante Rebić, who dropped out of the original list due to injury and Bruno Petković, who injured his shoulder. Cyprus have a point to prove in this competition and they can start by trying to come away with a result. Two losses and a win prior to this in the Uefa Nations League gives them something to build on. Cyprus have a full strength squad barring the suspension of Konstantinis Laifis. They need to showcase a whole other level of quality to try and compete against the Croatian team.

Given the quality their visitors possess, this is likely to be an uphill battle for the Czechs. Belgium should be looking to clinch their spot in the main competition with ease, as they’ll look to brush aside anyone who tries to stand in their way. Coming into this fixture with form that’s second to none, it should be a straightforward fixture from the Belgian standpoint. Czech Republic are not too bad in terms of form either. They’re coming off of a streak that has two wins and a draw. The draw coming against a German side who are in top tier contention for the main competition. They will have to be surgical with their preparations as they’ll be looking to guarantee their spot in the World Cup in 2022. And this fixture will act as a springboard to any glory ridden dreams they have with regard to success.
