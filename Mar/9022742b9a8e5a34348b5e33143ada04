The wife of a police officer at Runda police station has been found dead in his house with her seven-month-old baby in her arms. Damaris Chepkurui, 27, was found hanging on the window grill of their sitting room. Her widower told police he returned home at about 3am Monday and found her hanging on a shawl. He said he rushed to the kitchen and picked up a knife that he used to cut the shawl, believing she was still alive. Neighbours said the woman had looked stressed for a while. Police are questioning how she could have died yet be found holding the baby. Scenes-of-crime detectives visited the house and documented it before the body was moved to the mortuary. Nairobi police boss Augustine Nthumbi said they are investigating the matter. He said they want to understand the circumstances under which it happened and if there are other parties involved. “A team of experts is handling the matter. We don’t know the motive so far,” Nthumbi said. Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai in 2019 launched an initiative to stem cases of police officers suffering from work-related stress. Dubbed Muamko Mpya: Healing the Uniform Initiative, the programme sought to give psychological support to officers. Mutyambai said police officers who are often exposed to trauma that creates deep emotional scars need healing. “The ultimate goal of the initiative is to provide officers with knowledge, tools and a framework to assist them to support each other while handling traumatic situations,” Mutyambai said. “They encounter most of these situations on personal and professional levels.” He ordered the Kenya Police, Administration Police and Directorate of Criminal Investigations heads to ensure counselling is integrated into the police training curriculum.
