ANC has called a parliamentary group meeting on Tuesday to discuss ODM as a partner in Nasa. Lugari MP Ayub Savula, the chair of the parliamentary group, said on Sunday that they will discuss the party's relationship with ODM and the plot to file a petition against Matungu MP Peter Nabulindo's victory. Also to be discussed is a plan by the Orange party to work with Deputy President William Ruto. Savula said ODM had clearly stated its intentions to work with Ruto, which is against the Nasa coalition agreement. "It's clear that if you want to join another coalition, you must first exit the one you are a member. Let them officially exit Nasa and join the DP," Savula said. He said the plan by ODM to undermine ANC and its leader Musalia Mudavadi is against Nasa coalition's spirit. Savula said Raila Odinga is not behind these plans as "he is unwell". Both ODM and DP's camps have lately expressed the likelihood of working together in 2022. The talks became rife after the unveiling of the One Kenya Alliance by Mudavadi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, Kanu's Gideon Moi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula. The alliance appeared to isolate ODM from the former Nasa family in what experts say could push the Orange party to team up with UDA ahead of the 2022 General Election. Last week, ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna said the party was building a new coalition that would shake the country.
