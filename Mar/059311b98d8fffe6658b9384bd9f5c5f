President Uhuru Kenyatta and his wife Margaret have received their Covid-19 vaccine. In an exercise held at State House on Friday, the Head of State led other cabinet secretaries in receiving the vaccine. Those who received the jab include; Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe among others. Earlier, Uhuru ordered the Cabinet and all senior staff in the Executive to lead in getting the Covid-19 vaccine. Confirming the order, State House Chief Of Staff Nzioka Waita took to Twitter to show himself receiving the jab. This is an about-turn from governments' communication which stated that politicians were not on the list of receiving the first batch of vaccine. On Wednesday, the Health Parliamentary Committee stated that it wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to take the Covid-19 vaccine to give Kenyans confidence in taking the jab. The committee members led by their chair, Sabina Chege, said they were concerned about the low uptake of the AstraZeneca vaccine because they do not have any confidence due to its bad publicity abroad. They said all decision-makers in the country should be vaccinated in full view of the media so that Kenyans can see.
