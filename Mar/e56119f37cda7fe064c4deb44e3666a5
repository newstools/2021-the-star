Kenya national women’s team capped a splendid performance following 11-0 rout of Uganda at the Dashmesh Hockey Stadium, Nairobi. The Jacqueline Mwangi-tutored side were in a class of their own, taking a 3-0 lead in the first quarter in their maiden post-pandemic friendly match. Gilly Okumu opened the scoring with a poachers finish, slotting home in the sixth minute. A minute later, 19-year-old debutant Grace Bwire doubled Kenya’s advantage. Kenya’s dominance continued with Naomi Kemunto getting her name on the score-sheet with a tap at the near post in the 13th minute. Despite exerting their authority in the second quarter, Kenya could not extend their lead as Uganda were happy to defend in large numbers. Free-flowing Kenya rediscovered their spark with the trio again completing their brace in the third quarter as Kenya stuck to their attacking approach. Bwire completed her hat-trick with 12 minutes to go. Blazers’ trio of defender Flavian Mutiva (two goals) and midfielders Caroline Guchu and Tracy Karanja (a goal apiece) were also on the mark. “I am happy the juniors gave a good account of themselves. We need to improve on our passing in the remaining two matches. There’s a lot of potential in the side and can only get better,” said Kenya coach Mwangi. Her Ugandan counterpart Sandra Namusoke said the players should take valuable lessons to improve on their performance in the next two matches. “It was a learning experience for the girls. Fatigue played apart in the performance but there’s room for improvement. I am not worried about the score-line because I know we can get better. All we need to do is to tweak our midfield.”
