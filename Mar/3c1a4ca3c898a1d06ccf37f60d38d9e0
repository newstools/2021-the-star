South African president Cyril Ramaphosa has termed the late Tanzania president John Pombe Magufuli as a true Pan-African. Ramaphosa said the late Magufuli was a focused leader and remained unapologetic about being Pan-African. Speaking during the funeral mass at Uhuru grounds in Dodoma on Monday, Ramaphosa said Magufuli was dedicated to serving the people of Tanzania. "My friend did not like traveling, he preferred to stay at home and at one time I thought he was afraid of flying, but when I had a chat with him, he assured me that he would rather stay at home and serve the people than travel overseas," he said. Ramaphosa said this was a testimony to the work that he has done and left behind. "To us South Africans, he supported our course on the fight against apartheid," he said. Ramaphosa said the late Magufuli stood out as a warrior against corruption. "He was one of the new generation leaders who waged war against corruption, he believed leaders should work for the people and not for themselves," he said. The SA leader said Magufuli's focus on economic development is also commendable. "He was a true pan-Africanist who believed the culture of forefathers should be remembered. He wanted us as a nation to embrace Swahili which we have already introduced in our curriculum. In his honor, this will continue across our schools," he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta sent his condolences to the people of Tanzania saying the two countries will work together. "He was a respected leader in EAC and the world. For several years, he has shown that Africans have the capacity to be independent," he said. "I am here to mourn a friend, a close friend, we used to talk on a daily basis and we exchanged ideas regarding Kenya and Tanzania and EAC." Uhuru said he was shocked by Magufuli's death and had to make it to the funeral.
