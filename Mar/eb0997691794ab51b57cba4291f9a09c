Low voter turn-out marked the start of the Machakos Senatorial by-election in all the 1,335 polling stations across the county. Machakos County IEBC deputy returning officer Salisbury Bilali however said the voter turn-out is expected to improve during the day. At Mlolongo Primary School polling centre with 44 stations, the exercise kicked off at exactly 6.00 am. The voters had to wash their hands at various points strategically placed at the entrance of the school before queuing to cast their votes. Polling clerks refrained from touching the electorates' national identification cards. The voters instead displayed them to the officials to read the details. Two police officers have been assigned to each polling station. So, far no incidences have been reported during the exercise. Machakos County IEBC returning officer Joyce Wamalwa while addressing reporters at Kathome polling station in Machakos Constituency said names of all the 11 candidates cleared for the Machakos senatorial by-election are on the ballot.
