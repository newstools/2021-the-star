A man charged with assaulting a police officer has said the officer faked the charges against him after he refused to remit Sh100 daily bribe. Samuel Karanja Kariuki was arraigned before Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga for assaulting police constable Wycliffe Wangasa, an officer at Eastleigh police post. The court heard that Kariuki allegedly  poured hot soup at the officer who was  enforcing curfew orders at 11pm on March 16 at Eastleigh Section 3. He sells goat soup in the area. According to the prosecution, the complainant was jointly with others on patrol. Upon reaching Kariuki's kiosk, he came out and started hurling insults at them and demanded they free the people they had arrested. The officers advised him to get back to his kiosk but he continued to insult them, the prosecution said. When the officer confronted him, Kariuki ran back to the kiosk, and when the complainant followed him, he is said to have poured hot soup on him. He sustained burns on the leg as other officers came to his rescue. Kariuki denied the charges and told the court that the officer had a grudge with him for failing to remit Sh100 bribe he asks for on a daily basis. The accused said at the time of the incident, he was inside his kiosk — which doubles as his house — with his wife and children. “It was at 10pm and I was inside the house when this officer came and demanded that I open the door. He then hit the door and it opened. I did not assault him. He has a grudge with me since I have refused to give him Sh100 that he demands daily,” he said. A week ago, he said, the said officer arrested him and his wife and demanded Sh6,000 to release them. Nyaga, who freed the accused on a cash bail of Sh10,000, advised him to launch a complaint with the OCS at Shauri Moyo police station. The matter will be heard in July. Edited by EKibii
