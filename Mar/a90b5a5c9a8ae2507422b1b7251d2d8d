The Kakamega government has decentralised administration of the Covid-19 vaccine to subcounties to reach more residents. The jab will, starting Monday (yesterday), be administered in all the 12 subcounty hospitals. Facilities to offer the Covid-19 vaccine in the county include Kakamega County General Hospital, Butere County Hospital, Malava Subcounty Hospital and Likuyani Subcounty Hospital. Others are Navakholo Subcounty Hospital, Shins Health Centre and Khwisero Health Centre. Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said priority will be given to residents aged 58 years and above. The national government has expanded the first phase of vaccination to citizens above 58 years and to make the drive effective we've supplied the vaccine to make it's access easy," he said. Two weeks ago Deputy Governor Philip Kutima decried the low uptake of the vaccine among frontline healthcare workers in the county. The county received a total of 12,000 jabs of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The first phase of the vaccination targeted health workers, security personnel and teachers in all the 47 counties. Oparanya assured residents that the vaccine was safe. "I was among the first people to get the vaccine and I have not experienced any problem or severe side effects as people claimed," the governor said. Oparanya, who was accompanied by his deputy, spoke at Lukala Church of God in Malava on Sunday. On March 18, the governor said that the county was prepared to deal with emergencies. Edited by A.N
