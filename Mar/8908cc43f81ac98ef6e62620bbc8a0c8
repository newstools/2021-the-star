Singer David Mathenge, aka Nameless, has advised parents to teach their children about sexuality at every opportunity they get. Nameless said he has decided to create an environment that allows his daughters to tell him anything without fear of judgement. "Especially my firstborn @tumi.mathenge who is a teenager. I want her to be able to talk to me about anything, including questions on Sexuality so that she does not get confused by the peer pressure that comes with that age." The father of two explained that he believes teenagers should abstain from sex for many reasons but it is important that they truly understand the reasons to make that choice themselves. "Parents of teenagers, let's find ways to share our experiences and help each other bring up a well-rounded generation." Earlier, his wife Wahu wrote a similar post on her Instagram urging fathers to be close to their daughters. She posted a photo of her younger self saying despite life challenges, she got her daddy's full attention. The couple is raising two girls, Tumiso and Nyakio.
