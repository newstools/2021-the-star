"Apart from the withdrawal of firearms, the government will have to invoke Chapter 6 of the Constitution and state officials will be going to court themselves to clear any politician involved in violence to be declared unfit for any Public Office," Matiang'i said. He decried the fair bail terms and prosecution delays for prominent politicians.
