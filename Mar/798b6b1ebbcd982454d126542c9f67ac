Vihiga United FC tactician Sammy Okoth has attributed their poor results in the Football Kenya Federation Premier League to the exit of his strikers David Simiyu and Alex Imbusia. Simuyu joined KCB while Imbusia ditched the club for 2009 league champions Sofapaka in the final day of the transfer window. Okoth regretted the club released the two players and were financially unable to ship in their replacements. “Those who come in are green in as far as the league is concerned. We have to test and train them to fit in our playing system. My defence and the midfield are doing so well but I have been left with a blunt striking front,” he lamented Despite losing his priced forwards, Okoth called on the available ones to double their efforts in a bid to keep their top flight status. The club is currently placed 15th with 10 points following two wins, four draws and eight loses. “We still have hopes to remain in the league with our focus on next season," he said. Okoth in the meantime defended his players over the 5-0 drubbing at the hands of Bandari at the Mbaraki grounds, citing difficult conditions.
