Oserian coach Hudson Odari has urged his charges to keep up the moment  and  register good results to improve their chances of survival. After failing to win in any of their opening five matches this season, the team's fortunes have improved in the last four matches. The Naivasha-based side registered their first point of the season in a 1-1 draw with Trans-Nzoia Falcons a month ago before being awarded  a walk-over after Eldoret Falcons failed to honour the fixture owing to financial constraints. The results injected belief into the team as Oserian drew 1-1 with  hosts Nakuru West Queens. Their 1-0 home win against Kisumu All Starlets on Sunday courtesy of Esther Kwamboka's strike in the 86th minute further highlighted the team's progress. Oserian are placed seventh on the log with eight points while Sep Oyugis are a point ahead of them as the fight for safety enters homestretch with two teams facing the drop. Eldoret Falcons are sure bet to be relegated after failing to register a single point. Kisumu All Starlets and Trans-Nzoia who have 14 and 13 points respectively are not safe either with five matches to go. Oserian face Vihiga Queens this weekend before facing Wadadia, Sep Oyugis Trans-Nzoia and Eldoret Falcons in subsequent matches. Odari is targeting at least three wins to boost their survival hopes. "Looking at the remaining matches, we managed to get results against Trans-Nzoia and Eldoret Falcons. The team has turned a corner and three matches are winnable. If we can get a result against Vihiga, the players morale will be boosted going into the rest of the matches," Odari said. He added: "There's no doubt Wadadia are on form but the teams spirit is supreme at the moment and the players are ready to play any opposition. The six new signings have also brought competition and we are raring to go."
