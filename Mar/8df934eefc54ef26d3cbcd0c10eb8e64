The Bungoma courts have been partially closed after some staff tested positive for Covid-19. A public notice issued by magistrate John King’ori said the court will be closed down and that only urgent matters will be allowed. “I regret to inform you that our staff tested positive for Covid-19 and this necessitates that we scale down our operations until further notice to allow our staff to undertake tests to determine the level of exposure and way forward,” the notice reads. Judicial officers, court assistants and section heads will be available to handle urgent matters virtually. The new cases come at a time the government has rolled out a countrywide vaccination of all front-line workers in the fight against Covid-19. In Bungoma, 6,000 jabs will be administered to health workers and police officers. Bungoma health executive Antony Walela said they the two groups were given priority and will be followed by the vulnerable population. “We started administering the vaccine yesterday at the Bungoma Referral Hospital with health workers and security officers being on top of the list,” Walela said.
