Ghana, Tanzania and Nigeria have confirmed participation for the Nairobi Open wheelchair tennis tournament slated for April 26-27 at Nairobi Club. Tennis Kenya (TK)  administrator,  Nancy Nduku said she expects more countries to confirm participation in the coming weeks as teams gear up for the Euro-Africa qualifiers slated for May in Portugal. The Kenya team is currently training at the Mombasa Sports Club on the hardcourt surface—which is similar to the one that will be used  during the Euro -Africa event in Portugal. Ndenga, Phoebe Masika and Asiya Sururu will represent  the country in the women's category while Gilbert Lumumba, Rajib Abdalla and Peter Munuve will fly the country's flag in the men's cadre. Ndenga said they have stepped up their training and they are confident ahead of the Nairobi event.  "Our training has gone on well and we hope to be in peak condition by the time the Nairobi event rolls off,” said Ndenga. She said despite the Nairobi event being played on murram surface, they hope to adapt to the rigours of the new surface for the event. “ We are comfortable with the surface at Nairobi Club considering we have regularly played there," she said. Ndenga said she expects stiff  competition, especially with the current race for tickets for the Euro -Africa qualifiers in Portugal. Elsewhere,  80 players have confirmed participation for the Junior tennis tournament that starts on Saturday at the Nairobi Club. The tournament is open to children currently on school holidays. There will be three categories thus: Under 18, U-16 and U-14  and will run for two days.
