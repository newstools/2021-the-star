Nyatike residents have called on Kenya Wildlife Services to drive away hippos from Lake Victoria that have been attacking them. Odhiambo Nyakiaro, the Muhuru Bay Beach Management Unit chairman, said the number of hippos in the area has increased and the drought has led to more attacks. On Monday evening, fisherman Odhiambo Odero, 25, was attacked on the beach while mending his fishing nets. Adugo assistant chief Samora Machel said the victim was attacked on the legs and arms and was rushed to Sori Lakeside Hospital. “With the current drought, hippos move further inland to graze at dawn and dusk which increase cases of wildlife conflict,” Machel said. Residents have complained that the hippos have been grazing on their farms and attacking their livestock at night. Many have had to be in doors before 6pm until after 7am. Machel and Nyakiaro called for Kenya Wildlife Services to cull the hippos to protect the animals from being attacked by residents.
