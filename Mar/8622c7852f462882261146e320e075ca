The government has effected changes at the Agriculture and Food Authority a few months before it reorganises the organisation. Anthony Muriithi who has been acting director-general since October 2018 has been appointed as a diplomat and posted to Rome, Italy. Muriithi has been replaced at AFA by Kello Harsama who has been secretary administrator in the Crops Department. Harsama is not new to AFA as he once headed the miraa and pyrethrum task force implementation committee. Muriithi has been promoted to the position of Agriculture Attache. Expected to start his new duties on April 1, Muriithi will be the key contact consul to link the country with various multilateral donors including the Food and Agricultural Organisation, World Food Programme and International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD). Other responsibilities include coordinating bilateral relations between Kenya and Italy as well as other European countries that are coordinated from Rome. AFA was formed on February 28, 2014 after the collapse of former crops regulatory organisations. Then Cabinet Secretary Felix Koskei gazetted an interim management committee to oversee the management of the new agency. Muriithi's departure comes a few months before the government disbands AFA to reintroduce former food crop regulatory institutions. To restore the regulatory bodies by August this year, the ministry is currently engaging the public on various legislative bills. Tea Bill 2020 was enacted into law last year and assented to by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Sugar Bill is already in Parliament.
