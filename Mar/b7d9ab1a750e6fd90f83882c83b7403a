Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) are worried over the participation of some learning institutions in this year's league ahead of the April 3 kick off. Deputy match and fixtures secretary Moses Majiwa said while they are ready to roll out the fixtures, they are concerned that some learning institutions may skip the event owing to the partial re-opening of some universities. Majiwa said every team will have to confirm their availability to enable them prepare the fixtures. University teams in the KHU league include Strathmore Gladiators (men) and Scorpions (women) as well as United States International University-Africa USIU-'A' Spartans (women) and Shujaa (men) "We will hold a meeting this weekend and hopefully, we will release draft the fixtures ahead of the top tier league. As at the moment, we are yet to know which teams will be available. Institutions are raising concerns as some are only doing online learning," Majiwa said. He added:Â  "We are living in uncertain times and you cannot force a university to avail itself while conditions are unfavourable for them. Should circumstances not allow, we will go by those teams that will be available." The KHU league was halted in March last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The top tier league was the only competition given a go ahead to resume. However, National League and Super League are halted owing to Covid-19. National teams both senior and junior (men and women) have been training despite most international competitions being cancelled. "We have to abide by the protocols provided for by the Ministry of Health and we are open to any changes that will be made. We are still monitoring the situation and hope all will be well"
