DCI detectives based in Ongata Rongai have launched investigations into the suspected murder of a 28-year-old woman whose body was found dumped in a thicket on Wednesday evening. This is after she went missing a week ago. Joan Gloria Rumbale, a casual labourer at the area's Kazi Mtaani project, had in the morning of March 11, 2021, left her home for work, never to return. "After a day of no communication and fruitless search for her, her sister informed the police of her disappearance on March 13, where the report of a missing person was circulated and probe initiated," DCI said. However, DCI stated that their hope to find Joan safe and sound, was in vain after a herder bumped into a body, covered in a heap of rocks at a bush within Ongata Rongai's Kimani Road area in Kajiado County. "Heeding to a call by detectives who attended the scene where a lady's body with multiple injuries lay cold, a sister identified Joan's body and the crime scene investigation personnel have since processed the scene," DCI clarified. Born at Shanderema village in Kakamega's Mumias East sub-county, the deceased had joined her sister in Ongata Rongai where the two shared neighborhood. As the body awaits autopsy, detectives are capitalizing on potential leads to the perpetrator(s).
