Nairobi City Stars head coach Sanjin Alagic says the arrival of marauding fullbacks Bolton Omwenga and Kevin Okumu has improved the team’s flanks. Omwenga signed from Tanzania’s Biashara United while Okumu joined City Stars on loan from Wazito in the mid-season transfer window. The arrival of the two versatile fullbacks has fixed City Stars vulnerability on either flanks to the delight of Alagic. Omwenga, a former Nzoia Sugar, Kariobangi Sharks and KCB left-back was a miss in the last transfer window as he went to Tanzania while Chumsy opted for something new hence his move to Wazito. “We knew it from beginning of the season that we’ll suffer in those two positions if we didn’t bring in quality players. Unfortunately, even with a clear plan, we were not able to sign the players we wanted as our target Bolton left for Tanzania and Chumsy went to Wazito,” Alagic told the club’s website. He added:  “Now they are here and they have brought really positive impact on our flanks. They are quality players with the ability to play good both defensively and offensively with quality crosses. Bolton came off the bench to make his debut in an away game against Kakemega Homeboyz while Okumu earned his first Premier League game in City Stars colours against Zoo, where he scored on his debut. With both players on the pitch, City Stars has now registered four straight wins over Mutomo Tigers in the domestic cup, Zoo FC, Western Stima and lately against Mathare United. Bolton and Okumu were the only additions to the squad in the mini transfer window that lasted the entirety of February 2021.
