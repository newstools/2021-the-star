Members of Parliament on Thursday took a brief break from their normal business to condole with the people of Tanzania following the death of President John Magufuli. They mourned the departed President as a leader who was not shy to speak his mind, never minced his words, practical and one who could not tolerate the excesses of the West. Speaker Justin Muturi invited members to observe a minute of silence in honour of the late President. Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said: “Magufuli was a staunch Catholic and a humble president. We pray that God grants Tanzania comfort at this difficult time.” “He was on the frontline on push for family values having rejected the issue of same sex relationship. We salute him for that and we will miss him,” Wamalwa said. Kipipiri MP Amos Kimunya said Magufuli will be remembered for the war on graft and strengthening the Tanzanian public service. “We hope that the country would have peace as they undergo the transition,” the Majority leader said.Garissa Township Aden Duale said he remembers the late Magufuli as a person who believed in his country more than the EAC, and his neighbours. Sam Atandi of Alego Usonga said Magufuli will be remembered for two things – pushing Tanzania’s economy on an upward trajectory, and “giving a new meaning to democracy.” In a televised address on Wednesday night, Tanzania vice-president Samia Suluhu Hassan said that Magufuli had died of heart complications. Hassan said that Magufuli was hospitalised on March 6 at the Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute and died at Mzena State Hospital in Dar es Salaam.
