Over 120 golfers have confirmed participation in the Eldoret Captain’s Prize on Saturday at the nine-hole Eldoret Golf Course. The event will mark the end of  captain, Geoffrey Kitiwa two-year term in office after serving in one of the most difficult period amid  coronavirus pandemic. So far, he has drawn 108 golfers and expects more entries though not many considering the course is nine-hole and shouldn't be overcrowded. “I am expecting over 120 golfer and the event promises to be one of the  most competitive during my tenure as captain,” said Kitiwa. He said the preparations are on course despite the difficulties posed by Covid-19 pandemic. “It has been difficult to get sponsors but I am happy with the fact that I have  worked hard to keep golfers busy on the course,” he noted. According to the draw, the captain will play at 12:00pm alongside K. Anunda, E. Nyongesa and Tom Mutei. In the morning tee off, Michael Koech and B.
