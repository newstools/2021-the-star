Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said that all the county’s Level 5 hospital’s 15 ICU beds and the additional 12 HDU beds are full with severe Covid patients. In a tweet on Tuesday, the governor warned members of the public that the situation is so dire to an extend that “people are waiting for others to die to get a bed.” The governor added that all Machakos' 42 ICU/HDU beds with oxygen points are also full. He has appealed to the residents to adhere to the covid protocols and to avoid bars. Mutua's comment comes hours after Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union warned that there are no spaces left within Intensive Care Units across the country. In a press address on Tuesday, KMPDU Acting secretary-general Chibanzi Mwachonda said that the rising numbers of infections have not spared healthcare workers. He said that there are currently 10 doctors who are admitted for the virus. Mwachonda said with the doctors being admitted, Kenya needs more health workers to fight the pandemic. On vaccination, Mwachonda said health workers were afraid to take the vaccine due to lack of sensitisation. He however said the union will embark on a nationwide campaign to increase vaccine uptake by engaging with its members.
