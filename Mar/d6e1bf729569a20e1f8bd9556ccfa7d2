The Directorate of Public Prosecutions has now said it has new evidence against Garissa Governor Ali Korane in his Sh233 million corruption case. Prosecutor Mercy Gateru on Monday told the court that they have new information in case against Korane and his co-accused. Gateru told Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti that in the course of pre-trial with the witnesses they discovered new evidence which will be vital for the case. Ogoti allowed the DPP 14 days to serve the defense and a further 14 days for the defense to prepare for the case. The case which was set for hearing today was adjourned to April 19 as a result of the new information. Korane was last September barred from accessing his offices until his corruption case against him is decided. Ogoti issued the order barring office entry as he ruled on bail for Korane and four others charged with graft in the mismanagement of World Bank funds. The governor was arraigned on charges of corruption relating to mismanagement of a Sh233 million World Bank grant for urban upgrade. Korane was accused of misappropriating part of Sh233 million from the World Bank-funded Kenya Urban Support Programme. The governor and four others were charged with conspiracy to commit an economic crime of fraud. They denied the charge before Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti.
