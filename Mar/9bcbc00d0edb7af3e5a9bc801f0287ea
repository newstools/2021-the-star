Two people have been arrested for vandalising Kenya Power transformer in Kanyakwar, Kisumu county. Villagers within the area woke up to total blackout prompting some of them to go check on the transformers. When they arrived, they found two men vandalising the transformer. Area chief Charles Ochieng noted that its barely a week since locals from the area benefited from the last mile connection where around 50 people benefited from the connections. “We will be in total darkness because of the now vandalized transformer. We have been in the dark for so long and just when things changed, this incident happened,”he said. Kenya Power Chief Security Officer Western Region Zachary Ombati noted that in the last one month, there has been spike of transformer vandalism within the county. Ombati said the company has lost 11 transformers approximately valued at Sh 500,000 each within Kisumu county. Ombati said they have been trailing various suspects and following some leads and for the last one week, they got information that they were targeting a trasformer within Korowe area. “We put our men on the ground to gather the intelligence, so on Saturday morning we got information that a team was surveying transformers which they had a target of three, so we also mobilized our team to take care of those three transformers but unfortunately they came to this one”. He said they managed to arrest the two and still pursuing those who escaped.
