A KCPE candidate is among four teenagers who were on Tuesday charged at Makadara law court with robbery with violence. The four, aged between 16 and 17, pleaded guilty twice to violently robbing Victor Otieno Okwacho at Dandora phase III estate despite the court warning them that the offence attracts a death penalty. The court heard that the four on March 20 at 6AM while armed with pen knives, robbed Okwacho a mobile phone, earphones and cash money all valued at Sh14, 300 after threatening to use violence on him. After the charges were read, the four pleaded guilty to the offence. Makadara Chief Magistrate Angelo Kithinji, warned them that the offence they are charged with attracts a death penalty and asked the court clerk to re-read the charges, but they pleaded guilty a second time. The four are reported to have attacked the complainant at stage 41 along Counsellor Opundo road in Dandora as he was heading to work. They surrounded him on both sides and one of them removed a knife from his jacket before demanding he surrenders everything he had. For fear of his life, Okwacho gave out his phone and Sh4000 which he had in his pocket. He pleaded with them to leave him some cash but they refused and hurriedly walked away. The complainant screamed for help and members of the public, together with officers who were on patrol, responded. They gave a chase on the four culprits upon which they were apprehended. The four were also faced with an alternative count of handling stolen property after they were found with the complainantâ€™s mobile phone. Kithinji granted them a Sh500,000 bond without an alternative of cash bail. The case will be mentioned on April 6.
