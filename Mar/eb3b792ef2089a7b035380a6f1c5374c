Simon Mutuma and Faith Kendi are the ‘Shujaa wa Pool’ Meru/ Tharaka Nithi counties champions. The two overcame strong challenges from over 500 competitors in the region to bag the ultimate Sh500,000 award from a local youth empowerment organisation, Base Yetu Initiative aimed at boosting the youth in starting up businesses. The Nairobi-based regular pool player Mutuma, came from 2-0 down to easily register 8-3 win over Leonard Murithi to take home the coveted gong. “I came all the way from Nairobi to win this tournament. At first, I thought it might be difficult because of the opponents I encountered in the preliminaries but at the knockout stage, all has been well,” said Mutuma. Kendi, a part-time student at the Meru Polytechnic and a hairdresser at Makutano area in Meru, who has only played pool for two months now but easily outclassed Judith Gacheri in the final, to become the first woman ever to win pool at county level. She says due to the absence of female pool game lovers in the area, she had her eye on the prize all along having played against male opponents in the build up to the event. “Having played pool for two months without a lady competitor in Makutano area, I knew I was going for the big prize when I came here for the finals. But to be honest, I only got serious with the game when I heard about this tourney,” the elated champion said. The initiative is tailored to help the youth start up their own business. The next event will be held in Nyeri County in two months’ time, and Base Yetu inventor and CEO, Nick Mararo, has promised a better and bigger event.
