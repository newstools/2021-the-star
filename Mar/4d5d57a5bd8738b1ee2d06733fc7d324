The second round of the European Tour's Magical Kenya Open in Nairobi went on without live TV coverage with organizers attributing the hitch to unforeseen logistical difficulties. Originally, all the four rounds of the tourney at Karen Country Club had been slated for live broadcast on Sky Sports. The channel's official website said in a statement that European Tour Productions (ETP) were hopeful that live world feed coverage—used by Sky Sports and global broadcast partners —would be available in time for Friday's second round, only to confirm later in the day that there would be no televised action until the weekend at the earliest. The statement read in part: "Due to persisting logistical difficulties beyond our control, we will, unfortunately, be unable to deliver live world feed coverage of the second day of the Magical Kenya Open presented by Johnnie Walker on Friday 19th March 2021. "We are continually working to resolve the situation as soon as possible, and hope to be in a position to deliver live coverage later in the tournament as planned."
