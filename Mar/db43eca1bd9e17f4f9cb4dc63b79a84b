Kenya Railways has adjusted timings on the evening schedule effective Monday to enable passengers comply with the directives put in place by the government to contain the spread of Covid-19. The new times are as follows; for the Embakasi route, time has been adjusted with the new time being 5.00pm-5.30pm, Syokimau route 4.30pm-5.20pm, Ruiru route 4.30pm, Kisumu route 4.35pm and Athi River 4.50pm. Kenya Railways has also notified the public that all trains depart from the Nairobi Central Station. Prior to these new changes, Kenya Railways operated in the following manner; the Nairobi Central Station to Athi River train left the station at 5.50pm and the Nairobi Central Station to Ruiru route train left at 5.40. From Nairobi Central Station to Syokimau station, train left at 5.30pm and as for Embakasi time of departure from Nairobi Central Station was at 6.30pm. The new changes come after President Uhuru Kenyatta last week ordered a lockdown in five counties; Nairobi, Kajiado, Kiambu, Machakos and Nakuru, which he declared disease infected areas of Covid-19. "There shall be a cessation of movement into and out of the infected areas," he said on Friday. Kenya Railways on Friday announced changes in both the Madaraka Express Passenger Service and the Nairobi Commuter Rail service operations following the 15th Presidential Address on the Covid-19 pandemic.
