A couple has moved to court seeking to compel Nairobi South Hospital to release two of their newborn babies who are detained at the facility. Charles Ndonye and his wife Virginia Olembo who were blessed with quadruplets claim that the hospital has detained two of their infants who were born last month. Through their lawyer Alex Mola, they say that the bill now accrued to Sh3.5 million but the hospital has refused to take their undertaking and instead chosen to detain the two children. Olembo gave birth on February 1 and was discharged on February 26 with the two babies and not four. According to court documents, the hospital told them they would not discharge the babies because they were still receiving medication but later said they would be released on condition that they clear their bill. "The father has engaged the hospital to have the remaining two babies released including giving a proposal of settling the bill in installments but the hospital has neglected and failed to release despite having discharged them" reads court documents. They argue that the decision to hold on to the minors is illegal and unlawful which infringes on their rights. They further claim that the bill shot up to Sh4million because the babies were born pre-term and had to be put on further treatment.
