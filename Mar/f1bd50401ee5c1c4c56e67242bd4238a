The IEBC is spending around Sh9m to send eight commissioners and directors to Dubai for training in April on electoral boundary delimitation and modelling. This trip is completely superfluous. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission must already possess the expertise to define constituency boundaries. The commissioners say they will train IEBC staff on their return from Dubai. This is ridiculous. They should send permanent IEBC staff to Dubai, if deemed necessary, and, on their return, they could train the commissioners who are temporary. What proves that this training is a joyride is that it is being conducted by ESAMI which has offices in Nairobi. Normally the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute conducts its training in Arusha or regional capitals. ESAMI could easily have trained the IEBC team in their Nairobi offices. This training is completely unnecessary. The wrong people are being sent to Dubai to learn what they already know from an institution operating in Nairobi. This nonsensical trip should be cancelled immediately so that the taxpayer can save the generous per diems given to the travellers. If necessary, ESAMI can conduct the training in Nairobi or Arusha.
