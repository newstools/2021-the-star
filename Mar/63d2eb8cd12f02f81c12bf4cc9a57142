Leaders Vihiga return to Kenya Women’s Premier League action this weekend after qualifying for the FKF Women Cup quarters a week ago. Vihiga were among the seven Premier League teams to book places in the Cup quarter finals. On the league front, Thika Queens who lead Zone ‘A’ take on Ulinzi Starlets while Zone ‘B’ leaders Vihiga Queens  entertain neighbours Wadadia  in this weekend’s highlights. Vihiga remain unbeaten on 19 points after seven matches and are still on course for their fourth title. Wadadia, on the other hand, have rediscovered their spark after their opening day 2-0 defeat to the leaders on December 13 at Mumias Complex. Wadadia, who are third with 13 points, are keen to end their win-less run against the all-rounded Alex Alumira-coached team. “We have improved since losing our opening match and we want to maintain the good run. “Vihiga have won the last couple of matches against us but we can stop them this time. “I believe in the squad and the players can get the job done if they approach the game with the right mentality,” said Wadadia coach Rashid Sumba. Thika Queens are tipped to challenge Vihiga for the title and have their work cut out as they host Ulinzi at Thika Stadium. Thika are in a class of their own having maintained an unbeaten run. Debutants Ulinzi have proved a tough nut to crack and boast of experience in their attacking ranks. Revenge could be on the cards for the soldiers who lost 2- 1 in the reverse fixture despite being the better side.  “We moved on from that loss and now we have another opportunity of bagging three points,” said Joseph Mwanza, who coaches Ulinzi.
