Easter holidays have been thrown into a limbo with presidential directives hindering the celebrations in five counties. Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado, Machakos and Nakuru counties in-person worshipping was suspended until further notice over virus surge. On a regular Easter, Christians would celebrate every single day and spend nights in the church worshipping. The holidaysÂ see many Kenyans pile into crowded buses to return to their family homes in rural areas. The Interfaith Council led by Anthony Muheria in a statement on Saturday affirmed the presidential directive saying that it would affect the Easter celebrations. "These directives will apply even for the holy celebrations of Easter, Ramadhan and Hindu feasts that fall within this period of restrictions," Muheria said. Muheria said churches will not have in-person worship for the period of the restriction. "Therefore, in the areas where total restriction has been imposed, we will revert to on-line worship," he said. This will mean that each faith community will organize to have their worship relayed online for the benefit of the congregants. The leaders of the various worship services will be allowed to run the on-line service, with the number of people needed for the transmission, that should not exceed 15 persons. "These should not exceed one hour. This is for the weekly day of Worship," he said. The same can apply where possible for daily transmissions of worship services. Muheria also suspended all other gatherings of worshippers for the time being. "We urge our Religious leaders to help the congregants understand the reasons behind these strict measures," he said.
