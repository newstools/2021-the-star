Bandari's playmaker William Wadri is the Football Kenya Federation Premier League player of the Month for February. Wadri gave his closest competitor Sofapaka's Lawrence Juma a nudge to walk away with a personalised trophy and a Sh50,000 token. Tusker's Jackson Macharia was ranked third in the poll that also saw Bidco United's Eric Gichimu and Bandari custodian Justin Ndikumana coming fourth and fifth in that order. The Ugandan strutted to the podium on the back of the three goals he netted and an assist he provided to fire Bandari to a four consecutive winning streak in the month of February. His outstanding performance is largely the reason the dockers currently occupy a decent fifth position on the FKF-PL log after amassing 26 points, seven adrift of runaway leaders Tusker. Wadri fruitfully took up the gauntlet thrown down at him and fitted nicely in the shoes of absent regular goal poacher Yema Mwana to bolster the ailing striking department. He inspired the dockers to a slim away 1-0 triumph to the more fancied Kariobangi Sharks at the Utalii grounds, Nairobi before bagging a brace in their subsequent tie at home against 13-time Kenyan Premier League champions AFC Leopards. He was at the centre of Bandari's third goal when they ran over a hapless Vihiga United side whom they handed an emphatic 5-0 thrashing at the Mbaraki grounds. His exploits on the pitch served well in creating loopholes in the Ulinzi Stars as they went on to secure a well deserved 2-0 victory at the Green Stadium, Kericho. Wadri is the third player to be awarded this season after Elvis Rupia (AFC Leopards) and Henry Meja (Tusker) in the polls that kicked off in January.
