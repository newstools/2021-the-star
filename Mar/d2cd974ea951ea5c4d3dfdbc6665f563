Kenya Police will seek to extend their lead on top of the National Super League standings when they host Kibera Black Stars at Camp Toyoyo on Friday. The law enforcers lead the log with 29 points from 13 matches and coach Francis Mwangi is hoping that his side will bounce back from last week’s barren draw against struggling Murang’a Seal. Meanwhile, Sony Sugar will hope to return to winning ways after losing two consecutive games when they host bottom of the table Mt Kenya United. United recorded their first win after upsetting Coast Stima 2-1 at Camp Toyoyo last weekend and will seek to extend that form against the millers. Struggling Migori Youth will be at home against Nairobi Stima while newbies, Mully Children’s Family, host Mwatate United at Ruaraka Grounds. After a hard-fought 1-0 win over Mwatate United on Monday, Salim Babu’s Kisumu All Stars will welcome Murang’a Seal at Moi Stadium in Kisumu while Vihiga Bullets and Silibwet Leons will clash at Bukhungu Stadium. A Coast derby between Modern Coast Rangers and Coast Stima will be the highlight of Saturday’s fixtures. The game will be played at Serani Sports Ground from 3 pm. Second-placed FC Talanta will go into matchday 14 at Ruaraka Grounds against former giants Shabana hoping to close the gap on leaders Kenya Police. Ken Kenyatta's Talanta have 26 points and a game at hand. Last weekend, Talanta edged Nairobi Stima 3-1 while Shabana succumbed to a 1-0 loss against Fortune Sacco at Awendo Green Stadium. Kenyatta said he is going for maximum points against the Kisii-based side. “We are taking one game at a time in our bid for promotion,” said the tactician. Kisumu Hot Stars will be up against Administration Police Service Bomet at Moi Stadium as Fortune Sacco battle Soy United at Kianyaga Stadium.
