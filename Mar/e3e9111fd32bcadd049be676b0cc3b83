Wiper Democratic Movement Party has retained the Kitise/Kithuki ward seat after Sebastian Muli Munguti garnered 3,892 votes. He beat his closest challenger Joseph Kioko of Muungano Party who got 878 votes. Jacinta Wanza of the New Democrats Party came third after getting 553 votes. Muli was declared the winner by the IEBC Returning Officer for Makueni Constituency Ibrahim Guyo. Wiper is led by former Vice-President Kalonzo Musyoka while Muungano Party is headed by Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana. The other candidates were Paul Musembi Mwalali (370 votes), Francis Mutunga Katana (119 votes), Stephen Kilonzo Mutiso (19) and Daniel Mbwika (5). The Kitise/Kithuki seat was declared vacant following the resignation of Kelvin Mutuku in November last year. The MCA-elect thanked the voters for choosing him and vowed to continue with the developmental projects initiated by the former MCA. “We can only have one leader at a time. I am appealing to my competitors to join me in developing our ward. I also assure that I will serve all the voters in our great ward and deliver on all the promises I made during the campaigns,” said Munguti. Makueni County MP Rose Museo has said that Muli's win has cemented the Wiper Party popularity in the Ukambani region.
