Tractors hauling sugar cane in Migori county have been ordered to cease operations at night to avoid accidents. Rongo subcounty commissioner Andrew Mwiti said the decision was reached after complaints from residents over unroadworthy tractors. He said the vehicles must stop operations from 6:30pm to 6:30am and avoid parking in roads and centres where they often cause accidents. “By that time the sugar cane hauling tractors still operating should park in public institutions nearby,” Mwiti said. Speaking to the Star in his office in Rongo town on Thursday, the administrator said the government is concerned by increased cases of accidents caused by stationary sugar cane hauling tractors at night and those without lights. “We need to avoid loss of life. The directive has been communicated to stakeholders,” he said. Residents have often complained that stationary tractors, either parked or stalling on the road, have caused several accidents. “Some don’t have lights, which has caused major accidents with oncoming vehicles, and generally the sector is not regulated,” nominated MP Dennitah Ghati told the Star over the phone. Ghati said the Ministry of Transport and the National Transport and Safety Authority should impose measures to control the sector and make the directive official in law. On January 18, two people died on the spot, with the driver succumbing a day later, after a matatu rammed into a tractor hauling cane. The tractor had only one light and no reflectors. It had burst a tyre and stalled on the road. Rongo deputy police boss Zebedee Amsama said most sugar cane hauling tractors are not roadworthy. “We need a law passed for them to avoid transporting their haul at night. Most carry extra load, have no light or reflectors and are poorly serviced,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
