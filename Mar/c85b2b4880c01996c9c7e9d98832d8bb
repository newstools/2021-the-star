Kisumu Lakeside will now shift focus to their next matches after losing their two Premier League fixtures in Nairobi over the weekend. The visitors on Sunday were crushed 80-53 by Emyba at the Nyayo Stadium gymnasium and the result followed their opening 69-53 loss to Griffin Ligare-led Thunder at the same venue the previous day. “It wasn’t the results we anticipated,” said George Onassis. “We lost to teams reached semi-final playoffs last season. We have now shifted focus to the next matches.” Thunder made it two wins in two games after striking Umoja 80-74 in a closely fought encounter that saw Ligare drop 44 points. Colins Sudi hit Umoja’s 19. Coach Collins Gaya said it was a closely fought game and could have gone either way but his strong perimeter play saw him carry the day. Cliff Alela was good for 31 points as he guided Strathmore University Blades to 73-66 victory over Kenya College of Accountancy University. Kryl Odondo bagged 16 points for KCA in a losing fight that saw them trail by a close 37-36 margin at the break. In the lower division matches, Africa Nazarene University (ANU) were thumped 82-62 by Zetech University. Shoot for Life hit Neosasa 64-62, Nets beat Little Prince 32-20 and KDF Morans slammed Hope 40-23. Zetech University humiliated Hope 83-27 while Feba squeezed a 48-42 triumph over Nakuru Club in another game.
