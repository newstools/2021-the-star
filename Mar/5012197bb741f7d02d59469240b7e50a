A Tiaty resident has sued the state for imposing a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the area over insecurity. Kuriny Kemera says the recently expired 30-day curfew imposed by Interior CS Fred Matiang'i was illegal and should not be extended. He has sought a court order suspending the implementation of the curfew order or any extension of the same. Also sought is an order stopping the CS from publishing any extension. The Attorney-General and Matiang'i have been listed as respondents in the case, and the National Assembly speaker as an interested party. The curfew order was issued on January 25 following banditry attacks that left several people dead. Matiang'i had warned that the government would crack down on perpetrators, including several political leaders. He had said they had established that some of the politicians were behind the clashes. As a result, Tiaty MP William Kamket was arrested, questioned and released on a police bond. But Kemera says despite the expiry of the order, the inspector general of police has continued to infringe on the freedom of movement of the residents of Turkana East and Tiaty West. Kemera says in his suit papers that the curfew order, though published in January, was not tabled before the National Assembly within seven days as required by law and that in itself makes it void. “Section 11 of the Statutory Instruments Act obligates every Cabinet secretary responsible for a regulation-making authority to within seven days after the publication of the statutory instruments ensure that a copy is transmitted to the responsible clerk before tabling before Parliament. This was not done.” The fact that the order was gazetted same day means the members of public were not given sufficient time to read, understand and engage the state on the rules, he says. “The public was also not given ample time to ensure they would not be found in contravention of the order,” Kemera says.
