 Over 100 teachers in Vihiga have received the Covid-19 jab. Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers executive secretary for Vihiga Sabala Inyeli said 104 teachers were inoculated on Tuesday. The vaccine was administered to the tutors at Idavaga Muslim Secondary School. “The teachers who received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab were drawn from various schools across the entire county,” Inyeli said. He said the drive was targeting teachers aged 50 and above and those with underlying health conditions. Obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disease and diabetes are among the conditions that worsen Covid-19 sickness. The unionist said the vaccination exercise was voluntary. He urged teachers to turn out in large numbers and get inoculated. Inyeli asked school administrators to ensure Covid-19 prevention guidelines were strictly followed. “Covid-19 preventive measures as stipulated by the Ministry of Health including, maintaining social distance, use of sanitisers, wearing of face masks and regular washing of hands using soap and running water should be strictly adhered to in our schools,” he said. Inyeli urged parents to ensure their children get vaccinated against the contagious virus when their chance for inoculation comes.  Edited by P.O
