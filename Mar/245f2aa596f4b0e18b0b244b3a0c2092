Local sports could soon benefit immensely from proceeds donated by a first growing online gaming firm. Speaking on Thursday, BetLion's managing director Spencer Okach revealed that plans were now at an advanced stage to pump some of the proceeds of the Goliath Jackpot entries into the development of sports in the country. “We commit to making Kenyan sports better and we intend to use the proceeds from this jackpot to develop the same,” affirmed Spencer Okach. The pledge comes at a time many local sports clubs are grappling with huge financial constraints, partly occasioned by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. A number of football stakeholders have been urging corporate firms to consider coming on board in a bid to ameliorate the dire situation. The firm intends to raise money through an online game where with only Sh100 entry, Kenyans now have a chance to pocket a cool Sh350 million jackpot if they predict 20 games correctly in an exciting new online betting game. Okach said the game will be available on SMS, USSD, Web and Android App, adding the jackpot was currently the largest in Africa. “When we launched in Kenya, we did promise to construct a product that is not only exciting but also rewarding. The release of the BetLion Goliath Jackpot, Africa's Biggest Jackpot, is a true testament to that promise,” said Okach. Players will be eligible for bonuses of up to Sh100 million if they predict 19, 18, 17, 16 and 15 games correctly. Okach said BetLion had grown consistently since 2017 when they launched the FSB-powered online and mobile sportsbook.
