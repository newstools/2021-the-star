Bungoma county has rolled out the first phase of the Covid-19 vaccination. Governor Wycliffe Wangamati took the first jab of the 6,000 doses to be administered to health workers and security officers. Wangamati urged the health workers to take the vaccine positively, saying it will influence its reception by other residents. “We are calling on all our health workers to take the vaccine because it has been proven worldwide that it is good for human beings,” he said at Bungoma County Referral Hospital. Health executive Anthony Walela said medical practitioners will get the first priority in the distribution of the first batch of doses. “This is just the beginning, but the national government has committed itself to deliver 24,000 more doses to continue vaccinating our people. The vaccine is repeated after a fortnight to beef up the generation of immunity against the virus,” he said. Health chief officer Patrick Wandili hailed the medical staff for their efforts in serving Covid-19 patients. Doctor Johnstone Akatu said health workers have been trained to administer the vaccine safely. “We took our medical staff to Nairobi and they have been adequately trained. The drug has also been confirmed as effective,” he said. Knut, Kuppet, Kepssha officials and county security bosses were present and received the vaccine.
