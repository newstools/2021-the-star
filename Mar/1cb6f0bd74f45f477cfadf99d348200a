The Kwale government will start testing for Covid-19 using its own laboratory in two weeks, Governor Salim Mvurya has said. He said the new laboratory will be set up at the Msambweni subcounty hospital in the Covid-19 wing. “From this month we will start conducting the test here in Kwale,” he said. The governor said the county is yet to receive the testing machines and will be installed in the course of next week. He said the facility will accelerate the testing rate for Covid-19 in the region and supplement the Kilifi Kemri lab which is sometimes overwhelmed. Mvurya said the Kilifi laboratory takes the virus samples weekly due to the workload since most coastal counties sometimes depend on it. “At this particular time, Kemri lab does the testing once a week," he said. He said lack of continuous testing hinders the county’s efforts in the fight against the virus and it is their greatest challenge. Mvurya said the county rate of infection has been low since the onset of the pandemic, having reported 555 Covid-19 cases and eight deaths to date. He said there were no community infections and Covid-19 patients at the Msambweni hospital. The county chief said necessary interventions have been put in place to mitigate the spread of the virus along the borders. He said they have resolved to tighten border security and screenings for truck drivers and travellers. “No one should be allowed past our borders without fully complying with the public health directives, ” he said. Mvurya said they have resumed the community sensitisation campaigns, and fumigation of public places like bus stops, market stalls to stop the virus. County commissioner Joseph Kanyiri warned the residents against violating the Covid-19 preventive measures. He emphasised that hotel owners and school heads should ensure the public health rules are strictly followed. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
