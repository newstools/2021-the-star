Socialite Vera Sidika has once again shut down pregnancy rumours. Vera vented at the latest in a recurring pattern. "I don’t understand. Y’all say I’m pregnant every year. Sijui ni air pregnancy coz by now I should be having like four kids for the four years of rumours," she said. She said she always uses protection. "People have this narrative that I’m a bad b***h and should be having like 10 kids with different baby daddies by now," she said. "Let me tell you a secret: most bad girls are the most careful ones. Can’t just go around having babies with everyone. I have never gotten pregnant coz I always protect it. But the day I do, it’s because I am ready at that time and want it." Back when Vera was breaking up with Otile Brown, he alleged she aborted his child.
