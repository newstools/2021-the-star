Former EACC CEO Halake Waqo on Friday snubbed summons to appear before the Public Investments Committee. This was the second time the Universities Council Board failed to appear before the lawmakers to answer to queries on his link to the Sh7.8 billion PPE scandal at Kemsa. Waqo was linked to Aszure Commercial Services, a firm that was irregularly paid for supplies worth Sh347 million. A director of the company dropped the official's name while appearing before the Public Investments Committee probing the controversial Sh7.8 billion Covid-19 supplies. Zubeda Nyamlondo told MPs that the official signed as the firm's surety for a loan she sought from First Community Bank. MPs want answers on how the company got the Sh347 million tender for the supply of face masks yet it is not registered as a supplier of hospital consumables. The firm was prequalified by Kemsa as a supplier of office furniture, fittings, and other assorted equipment. PIC chairman Abdulswamad Nassir said no further notice would be given to the ex-EACC boss, and that they would not accept apologies delivered by phone as was the case after the official skipped the meeting.
