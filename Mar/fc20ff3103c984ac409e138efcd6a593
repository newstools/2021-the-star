Jubilee Party secretary general Raphael Tuju has threatened to take disciplinary action against a Kajiado nominated MCA for alleged gross misconduct. He is a Tangatanga-leaning member of Jubilee. In a letter dated March 1 and received by the MCA, Onesmus Ngogoyo on Thursday, Tuju said the party nominee to the Kajiado county assembly violated the party code of conduct and failed to uphold a communicated party position. “We have received a complaint concerning your conduct at the county assembly, which is in breach of Article 13 of the party constitution,” the letter read. Ngogoyo was given seven days to show cause why disciplinary action cannot be taken against him. While responding to the contents of the letter on Thursday morning, Ngogoyo said some county leaders were feeding the party headquarters with wrong information. “All these came up because I hosted DP William Ruto in Kajiado North on February 19,” Ngogoyo claimed. He said he has been in politics for 15 years and understands all the rules of political parties. “I will not respond to Tuju because that letter is malicious. I cannot stop supporting the DP,” added the MCA.  The MCA alleged the Kajiado  Governor Joseph Lenku had a hand in what he is facing. When contacted for comment, Lenku’s personal assistant Daniel Kanchori denied that his boss talked to Tuju regarding Ngogoyo’s conduct. “That is ridiculous for the nominated MCA to link me to such claims. Let him carry his cross for whatever he has done,” said Kanchori. However, Ngogoyo and Lenku have been trading accusations at each other from the time the MCA joined the Tangatanga group of the Jubilee party. Lenku, while attending a fundraiser in Keek-Onyokie late last year, accused Ngogoyo and another MCA of disrespecting him and warned the two to “toe the line." (Edited by V. Graham)
