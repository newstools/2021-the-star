Seven Kenya Certificate of Primary Education candidates, who had not registered for the examination as required, have been cleared to sit the test. The candidates are from Borabu Subcounty in Nyamira County. They will rely on extra examination scripts which local education officials are collecting and consolidating from neighbouring examination centres. The County Director of Education, Margaret Mwirigi said the learners attended a private school in the area which failed to register them. She said her office in conjunction with the officials of the Ministry of Interior and coordination of National Government enrolled them to enroll at Nyagacho Primary School. She spoke on Monday at Nyagacho Primary School when the Principal Secretary for Early Learning and Basic Education, Julius Jwan visited the school yesterday. Mercy Karogo, the Kenya National Examination Council chief executive on Tuesday told the Star that the matter is under investigation. "While the other arm of government is being investigated, we want to make sure that the candidates are not punished for a mistake that is not of their making," Karogo said on phone. Jwan expressed satisfaction with the swift action to save the education of the seven pupils, saying they were innocent. He assured the pupils that the Ministry would ensure they were placed in secondary schools appropriately. No major incidents were reported on Monday as the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exam began smoothly across the country. The exam entered day two today with Education CS George Magoha supervising the examination distribution exercise in Machakos County. PS Jwan supervised the examination distribution in Uasin Gishu County. Other officials who took part in the exercise include: KNEC chairman in Mombasa County, Education CAS Hassan Noor in Garissa County, and CAS Sarah Ruto in Machakos.
