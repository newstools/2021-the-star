Kyalamoko residents in Nguni ward Mwingi Central sub-county will no longer walk for 20 kilometres in search of water to River Enziu which is the nearest source. This is after a solar-powered borehole that has been non-operational for six months got repaired. The borehole broke down in July last year. John Mwangangi, a resident says water shortage had hit the Kyalamoko area harder, as a jerrycan of water was going for over Sh40 and most residents could not afford it, forcing them to alternatively walk for the many kilometres to access water. Now a jerrycan is going for Sh3 only. Tabitha Mulu another resident from the area narrates how they used to walk overnight in search of water and most of the time their children were not going to school as they could spend more time fetching water. “Now we are happy to access water a few meters from our homes,” Mulu said. Kitui CECM in charge of Water, Agriculture, and Irrigation, Kyalo Muthusi, said the solar-powered borehole was sunk in the area by an NGO in partnership with the county government and has been providing water for an area of over 20 square kilometres and in four villages that are; Imba, Sosoma, Mbuvu, and Kavulundi. Kyalo pointed out that the borehole produces 21 cubic meters per hour which is a lot of water to serve Nguni residents adequately. “The county government through the ministry of water has extended a 7 kilometres pipeline that is connected to water kiosks to serve people who draw water along the way. It is now planning to extend 5 more kilometres of the pipeline to serve Ukasi residents,” he said.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
