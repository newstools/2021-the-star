Busia has announced plans to upgrade seven health facilities to improve services. Medical Services chief officer Isaac Omeri said Amukura, Matayos and Bumala B health centres will be elevated to subcounty hospitals, while Malaba, Obekai, Khayo and Budalang’i dispensaries will be upgraded to health centres. “Our department has already done an assessment of the facilities for the upgrade with the objective of improving service delivery to residents who seek health services,” he said. Omeri spoke during the flagging off of medical equipment at Matayos Health Centre. “This is in line with the fact that we have commissioned a number of dispensaries and hence need to increase the number of health centres. That will go a long way in dual support by increasing revenue and also making our people to access health services much closer.” Directors Janerose Ambuchi (Medical Services) and her Public Health counterpart Melsah Lutomia were present. “The upgrading of these health facilities will increase the number of facilities that can handle critical care in the county,” Lutomia said. Busia County Assembly Health and Sanitation Committee chairman Vincent Ojiambo, who is also the Bukhayo West MCA, applauded efforts by Busia Governor  Sospeter Ojaamong and Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi for transforming the health sector despite criticism. He said his committee is committed towards ensuring that the department achieves its agenda of serving the people of Busia.
