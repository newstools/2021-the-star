Kenya Police maintained their lead on top of the National Super League (NSL) after a hard fought 2-1 win over Sony Sugar at Awendo Green Stadium in Migori County on Wednesday. The law enforcers opened a five-point lead gap on top of the table after match day 13. However, Kenya Police have played one more game than second-placed Talanta. Talanta coached by Ken Kenyatta edged Fortune Sacco 1-0 in a mid-week clash and are on 23 points while the log leaders have 28 points. Yesterday, Kenyatta was happy with his charges’ performance in the league so far. “We are in good position at the moment and we want to maintain the momentum because ultimately, we want to qualify to the KPL,” said the former Ushuru coach. Coast Stima sit third on the log after battling to a barren draw against visiting former Kenya Premier side, Kisumu All Stars. Stima have 20 points, one better than fourth placed Fortune Sacco, while former giants Shabana are fifth on the log also on  19 points but with an inferior goal difference. On Wednesday, Shabana played to a barren draw against Administration Police Service (APS) Bomet. Shabana coach attributed the draw to failure by his players to convert their scoring chances. “Again, failure to utilise our scoring chances cost us. The draw is not a result we anticipated. We now focus on our next match because our target remains qualifying to the top tier league next season. That’s my dream,” said Ongoro. Shabana will host Fortune Sacco on Sunday. Mt Kenya United remain bottom of the log with a paltry six points after playing to a barren draw against Vincent Nyaberi’s Murang’a Seals at St Sebastian Park in Murang’a.  Seals are 19th with nine points. Action resumes on Sunday with seven matches on the cards while three games will be played on Monday.
