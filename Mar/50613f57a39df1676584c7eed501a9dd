The government of Kitui has adopted the Covid-19 antigen-based Rapid Diagnosis Test, much to the reprieve of those infected or seeking to know their status. The new test only available at Kitui Referral Hospital and Mwingi Level 4 Hospital provides results in 30 minutes, according to Health and Sanitation chief officer Kioko Kiilu. “These days one does not need to go to Kemri for a Covid-19 test anymore. If you go to Mwingi or here at the Kitui hospital you will be tested and get results immediately since were are using the Rapid Diagnostic test,” Kiilu told the media on Tuesday. In the past, the county struggled to test large numbers of people to control the pandemic as samples had to be taken to Kemri in Nairobi. There have been cases where results of samples taken to Kemri were misplaced or lost. Kiilu said with the help of the new Covid-19 testing method, health workers are able to confirm within a short time whether or not a person is infected. He warned of the exponential upsurge of coronavirus infection in Kitui county and called on residents to take personal responsibility to avoid catching Covid-19. Although he did not give any figures, the chief officer said the Covid-19 prevalence in Kitui  was worrying, adding that managing the surging numbers of the sick could sooner than later become impossible. "Residents must do everything in their capacity to avoid being sick. We do not have the capacity to do case management,” the chief officer said. Edited by Henry Makori
