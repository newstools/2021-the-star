A judge has extended orders stopping Nairobi County from increasing parking fees from Sh200 to Sh400. The temporary order will be in place until April 21, when the case will be heard. Judge Anthony Mrima extended the order on Wednesday after a plea by COFEK and the Matatu Owners Association. The county had last year issued a notice to increase parking fees which would seeÂ  matatu owners pay Sh1,000 daily. However, Cofek challenged it, saying that it would hurt consumers seeking transport and parking services within the CBD area. The order suspending the increase was first issued by Justice James Makau. City Hall has for years attempted to raise parking fees. In 2019, it had sought categoriesed fees based on three zones, with the CBD having the highest fees.
