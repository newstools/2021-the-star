Kenya is home to some pretty spectacular resorts and hotels and Lamu is no different. With beautiful beaches and stunning architecture it is the perfect place for a getaway this Easter. If you are looking for the ultimate luxury, look no further than The Majlis. Frequently visited by Celebrities, The Majlis is a privately owned luxury beach hotel on Manda Island. It features breathtaking views with an elegant Lamu Island style. For those stuck in the city, particularly in this climate, a few days in paradise sounds like a fantastic idea. Who wouldn’t want to wake up hearing the waves gently drench the sand as the sun warms your skin, before sauntering over to one of their beautiful swimming pools for a dip or breakfast with a view. After a relaxed morning, a trip to the beach is obviously needed, and perhaps some water sports, completed with a sunset dhow as you reflect on your day. There is something about being by the ocean that seems to heal our souls, and after the year we’ve had, a lot of us have some healing to do. And while places like the Majlis may seem out of reach, they now have an amazing deal if you wanted to escape with someone special. This Easter, the luxury hotel is opening its doors, offering an amazing chance to spend some time on the Island of festivals. For a deluxe non-sea facing room, its only sh.36,000 per room. For a room with a sea-view, its sh.40,000 per room per night, and for their junior suite sh.54,000. The prices include two people sharing on a full board basis. For this offer which runs from the 1st of April to 7th of April, you can book your flights from Nairobi to Lamu at only sh.23,800 per person through Safarilink. A luxury break has never been easier, so this Easter grab that special someone and escape to one of the most beautiful places in the world.
