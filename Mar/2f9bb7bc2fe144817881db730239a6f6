An activist wants Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i jailed for six months for disobeying a court order in relation to the Sh1 billion new number plates tender. Okiya Omtatah accuses Matiang'i, Principal Secretary Zeinab Hussein and Prisons commissioner general Wycliffe Ogalo of failing to comply with a court order to provide him with the tender documents. “This court is under obligation to assert its authority both by punishing those who disregard its orders and by quashing anything done defying the said orders,” Omtatah said. He said that court orders are not given in vain because if that were the case then there would be no point of parties seeking justice there. On December 9, last year, the parties in the case recorded consent before Justice James Makau to supply Omtatah with the restricted tender documents in seven days. The state was also ordered to confirm that the machines and materials indicated as ordered on Kamiti G K Prison production facility have been admitted in the further affidavit of Hussein. The consent arose out of a case filed by Omtatah challenging the tender for license plates production facility and start-up raw materials.
