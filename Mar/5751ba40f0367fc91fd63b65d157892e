At least three people have been killed and several injured when a bus they were traveling on, was hit by a bomb set on Arabia Road in Mandera county. The bus was heading to Mandera Town from Lafey on Wednesday morning when it ran on an Improvised Explosive Devise . Witnesses said the bus was badly damaged after it was hit by the explosive. Pictures taken at the site showed the bus roof ripped off with casualties lying around the scene. Police said they fear the number of casualties will increase. Mandera governor Ali Roba also confirmed the deaths. This comes a day after security agents repulsed an attempt by al-Shabaab militants to attack a police camp in Lafey, Mandera County in the latest such incident. It is believed the same group is behind the attack on the bus. The gang fired two Rocket Propelled Grenades and fired several times into the Border Patrol Unit camp in Sheikh Barrow area before they were repulsed. Security agents have been on alert following reports of a planned attack by the militants in the area. It happened two weeks after a similar attempt was made on a camp in Elram area, Elwak, Mandera County on March 10. More to follow
