A lawmaker is the talk in Parliament (pictured) corridors by those who say they are tired of being called from time to time to help push his car. The politician could soon have nobody, especially those who have had an experience with him, helping with a hard start again. Those he has been engaging say the man wants to appear to be living large yet he is not ready to part with even a shilling, not only to appreciate their help, which is becoming a daily affair, but also to buy the car — said to be for his security men — a decent battery. *** A second-term MP endured embarrassment during a public hearing on the Building Bridges Initiative early this week. The ODM legislator, who portrayed himself as a ‘Mr Know It All’ on matters law, was shamed by a university student who told him to his face that he is one of the most pathetic debaters in the House. The two were embroiled in a bitter argument on whether the electoral commission could use population data on administration units in the planned delimitation of constituency boundaries. *** It seems a lawmaker from Nyanza did not know what he was up to when he challenged the chair on the floor over a question he sought answered but is yet to be answered. The man, saying he was just registering his dissatisfaction, got his share of the chair’s ever-ready shots after he claimed “the question was cleverly killed.” The chair was fast to remind the fellow that he should have read the House rules, “which are very clever, and were cleverly done.” He was equally reminded that there is no place to register questions about last year. The man is now contemplating asking the question afresh.
