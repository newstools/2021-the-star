The water shortage in Mwingi will end in the next two years, the county government of Kitui has said. Water executive Kyallo Muthusi said the county government has plans to end the problem once and for all. His sentiments came after Mwingi residents held a peaceful demonstration following three months water rationing. "We have procured a bill of quantities and the process to do a fresh infrastructure at Kiambere dam will cost around Sh4 billion," he said. The project will take up to two years because the money needed cannot be budget in one financial year, Muthusi said. Mwingi residents get water from Kiambere dam. KIMWASCO managing director Paul Kinuba said the amount of water pumped per day is 2,800 cubic meters but the demand is 10,000 cubic metres per day. "The company initially pumped water to 15,000 Mwingi residents but the current population is 45,000 thus the demand is higher than the supply," Kinuba said. He added that it's the reason the town has been experiencing rationing so that every part of town can get water. "We plan to end this water shortage once and for all by ensuring we come up with mechanisms that can produce over 10,000 cubic meters of water per day in Kiambere dam," Muthusi said. Residents have been complaining of acute water shortage in the town for three months. " We fetch water as far as Kyulungwa, Mutwangombe among other areas as Mwingi town water kiosks only open for one hour or don't open at all," complained Mary Kimanzi, a water vendor. She said during this time when the country is battling Covid-19, water should be sufficient in order to observe the protocols set by the Ministry of Health. Edited by Henry Makori
