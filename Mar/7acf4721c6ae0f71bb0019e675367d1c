Malkia Strikers are set to tour Brazil and Turkey in readiness for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in July. The side, comprising 16 players will be in Brazil for a month, starting  May 1-30 — and head to Turkey for a fortnight before the final squad is named for the Olympics. Team manager, Alfred Chedotum, said despite Brazil being a hot spot for Covid-19, they are monitoring the situation with daily updates and will make the right decision when the time comes. “We know Covid-19 is a big challenge in Brazil but we are monitoring the situation," said Chedotum. Chedotum added that four Brazilian coaches are expected in the country from next month to help prepare the side for the Tokyo Games. "We have four coaches coming from Brazil mid next month as we step up preparations for the training camp and Olympics later in the year," he added. Chedotum said the world governing body, FIVB will foot the bills for the two camps. "I would like to thank the world governing body for their support in enabling us to go and train in those two nations,” added Chedotum. From Turkey, the team will return to Nairobi, where a final team of 12 will be named and thereafter depart for Kurume City for another training camp before heading to Tokyo for the July 23 to August 8 Olympics. The national team started residential training at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani on Monday after players took the  Covid-19 tests. "We will follow all the Covid-19 protocols for the duration we will be in the bubble,” he added. This will be the second time for Kenya at the Olympics, having made their debut at the 2004 edition in Athens, Greece.
