Counties recorded an all-time low local revenue collection even as it emerged the devolved units are splurging huge chunk of their resources on recurrent expenses as development lags. A new report by Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakango shows the counties generated a paltry Sh12.72 billion in six months against an annual target of Sh54.41 billion. This represents 23.4 per cent of their annual targets. The 2020-21 half year budget implementation review report the collection was decreased compared to Sh15.33 billion generated in a similar period the year before. “Counties that recorded the lowest proportion of own source revenue against annual targets were Isiolo (8.8 per cent), Narok (10.7 per cent) and Homa Bay (11.1 per cent),” reads the report. The low collections can be attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic even though counties’ inherent challenges—revenue loopholes and failure to automate collection—can be blamed for the under collections. Tana River, Busia and Migori posted the highest proportion of collections at 16.9 per cent, 43.2 per cent and 41.5 per cent respectively. In terms of actual collections, Nairobi led with Sh3.96 billion, followed by Mombasa (Sh1.07 billion), Kiambu (Sh897.96 million) and Machakos (Sh417.42 billion). Counties that posted the least collections are Lamu (Sh24.80 million), Homa Bay (Sh32.99 million), West Pokot (Sh44.61 million) and Tharaka Nithi (Sh44.94). Nyakango reveals in the report that the counties spent an aggregate of Sh109.71 billion or 81.3 per cent of their total expenditures on recurrent activities. Out of which, Sh78.85 billion or 71.9 per cent was incurred on staff emoluments and Sh30.86 billion or 28.1 per cent on operations and maintenance. In sharp contrast, the devolved governments spent Sh25.19 billion on development activities, representing 13.7 per cent of annual budget. However, this was an increase from 11.6 per cent reported in a similar period the year before when development was Sh22.77 billion. Nandi, Bungoma and Lamu recorded the highest absorption on development at 38.4 per cent, 37.0 per cent and 33.5 per cent respectively. Further, the report indicted Homa Bay, Nyamira and Elgeyo Marakwet for disregarding the ceilings set and posting higher expenditures on MCAs siting allowances. On average, each MCA in Homa Bay pocketed Sh172,295, those in Elgeyo Marakwet took home Sh125,010, while Nyamira ward reps earned Sh140, 973 per month for six months. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission has capped the monthly sitting allowance at Sh127,800 per ward representative. Overall, however, report shows there was reduction in expenditure on MCAs’ sitting allowances— from Sh1.16 billion at the same period last year to Sh1.06 billion in the period under review—an area that has sunk billions of taxpayers’ money before. Nyakango also observed that county workers are staring at a miserable life in retirement because their employers are not remitting contributions to pension schemes to secure their future. The devolved units had not submitted Sh40.57 billion, comprising Sh26.02 billion owed to Local Authorities Pension Trust  and County Pension Fund and Sh1.39 billion to Local Authorities Provided Fund. “The office noted delays by county governments to remit staff contributions to pension schemes which has affected the ability to settle claims for retiring members,” reads the report in part. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
