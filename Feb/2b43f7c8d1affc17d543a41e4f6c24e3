Singer Beryl Owano is back after a one-year hiatus from the music industry. Owano was working on new music and bettering herself as a musician and has released her single 'Fire Emoji' as her welcome-back song. “The song is a celebration of being a woman who is in charge. It captures a combination of explosive beats, catchy looks and dope writing,” she said in a statement. This song is off her upcoming debut EP 'Omukhana Msanii'. Her drive, coupled with her tantalising vocals, won her the 'Female Artiste of the Year' in the Kisumu Teeniez Awards in 2017. After battling depression in 2018, she bounced back and landed a nomination for the Best Breakthrough Video for her song 'Utafilisika'. In 2019, she landed another nomination for her song 'Kalipso'.
