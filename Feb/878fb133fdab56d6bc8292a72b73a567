Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua has said the 'Linda Katiba' campaign against the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) will go on uninterrupted. This comes hours after Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana changed tune in support of the constitutional amendments under BBI. Kivutha was among politicians opposing BBI but on Monday, he made a U-turn. The governor said that his decision followed wider consultation with MCAs from both Makueni and Machakos counties. “We agreed that MCAs should respect the will of the people who endorsed the BBI amendment proposal from the recent Public Participation (PP) fora,” Kivutha said in a tweet. He added that the voice of the people was supreme during the public participation fora. “Wananchi said the 15 per cent revenue allocation to counties had greatly transformed rural economies. In that regard, I wish to respect the will of the people and ask MCAs to do the same.” The governor met ODM leader Raila Odinga and former Trade minister Mukhisa Kituyi on February 18, and the purpose of the meeting was not disclosed to the public. Reacting to Kibwana’s changing camps, Karua said that “many will be called but few will be chosen; the Linda Katiba campaign continues uninterrupted. Aluta continua.” The Karua-led Linda Katiba lobby is set to unveil a website which Kenyans can sign up to oppose the Constitution amendment drive. "We are calling for the full implementation of the 2010 Constitution, which has been vandalised, abused, cannibalised and destroyed," Karua said during the launch of the campaign. Karua said Kenyans have the numbers to defeat the "selfish plans by the political class". "We are the majority, some 50 million Kenyans. Do not show us the five million signatures you collected.”
