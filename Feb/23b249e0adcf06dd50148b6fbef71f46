The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has donated medical supplies to Naari Level 4 Hospital in Meru. The donation was made in conjunction with United Sikhs on February 25. It is aimed at fostering a good relationship with the public. "We are not only engaged in hunting down criminals and bringing justice to victims of crime, but we are also actively engaged in bringing smiles to people’s faces through voluntary humanitarian service, " the DCI posted on its Twitter handle. DCI boss George Kinoti emphasised on the need to give back to society. He said the drugs they have donated would go a long way in complimenting the hospital’s capacity to serve over 30,000 people within its reach. He spoke during a ceremony graced by Meru health chief officer James Kirimi and hospital board chair Jennifer Makena. Later in the day, the team visited the Cottolengo Mission Hospital Centre for people with disabilities in Chaaria and made donations. The home takes care of over 50 boys with different forms of disabilities. With its already outstretched resources, the centre is home for boys who have been abandoned by their families. While appealing for even more assistance, hospital director Brother Giam Carlos, said the centre depended on proceeds from the hospital and donations from well-wishers to run its daily operations. The budget for drugs alone is over Sh500,000 annually. Shiva Singh, who led the United Sikhs team, pledged more support to the home. Kinoti thanked the United Sikhs Kenya through Dr Jaswinder Benawra and Gurbachan Singh Benawra, who mobilised the resources. He also called on other well-wishers to partner with the DCI in the management of crime, through fostering mutually beneficial relationships with the local communities and assisting the less fortunate in society.
