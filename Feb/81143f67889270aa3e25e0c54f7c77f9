The Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service acting CEO Agnes Wahome has been confirmed to be the first woman chief executive of the student placement body. Wahome's appointment comes after a heated leadership dispute at the agency that saw former CEO John Muraguri sent on leave in November last year pending his retirement. Muraguri's contract with KUCCPS expires on March 9 this year. He was eligible for a second term but among other reasons, his age disqualified him. Wahome was appointed by the Education CS George Magoha, as the substantive Chief Executive Officer of KUCCPS with effect from February 1. She has been the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Placement Service since November 13. She comes in as the second Chief Executive Officer at the Placement Service, and her immediate focus is to work with the Board to embark on the development of the second Strategic Plan for the organization. She will also be responsible for revamp of the career guidance programmes and enhance partnerships for the same. Wahome will also be responsible for reviewing the placement criteria in consultation with stakeholders and initiate preparations for the alignment of student placement with the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC).
