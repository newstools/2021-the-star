Andy Capp, a famous English comic strip cartoon, has received a gift package from Tusker. Andy Capp is a cartoon about a man, his drink, his favourite pub and his wife Flo. It is a creation of the famous cartoonist Reg Smythe. Taking to Twitter on Tuesday, Andy Capp announced he was grateful for the gift and thankful for Kenyans' support. "Well, my good pals Tusker Lager in Kenya have supplied us with a fantastic gift. Thanks to Manoah Esipisu (Kenya's High Commissioner to the UK) and Charles Gacheru for organising this," Andy Capp said. "And thanks to all my friends in Kenya for supporting my quest to try new everywhere." Andy's post attracted a lot of mixed reaction from netizens. Here are some interesting comments under his post; @BeirutMputhia replied, "Goes well with goat ribs and kachumbari moto moto, enjoy". Kelvin Muhindi@Aggripinus said, "True to the Kenyan way, "mbili kwa bill yangu" ey". Another user suggested that Andy Capp should now open his own pub. Which Andy replied, "I'd probably ban myself ha". Mūithìrandū@GKlif said, "Baada ya kazi the tusker beer is awesome but I think Andy you'd require a crate of it". Martin Kisuu@MartinKisuu said, "It goes down better in Kenya, especially if you meet Kenyan cops on your way home. Try it!!". Andy Capp said White Cap should 'definitely' be next.
