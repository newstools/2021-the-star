The county assembly of Vihiga has passed the Constitution Amendment Bill, 2020. While deliberating on the Bill on Thursday, MCAs criticised MPs on the stand they have taken over car grants. "MPs are the most corrupt; they should first return the Sh 7million car grant before branding us as the corrupt," Majority Whip Victor IjaikaÂ said. Vihiga's move brings to 10, the counties which have passed the Bill. Other counties that have passed the Bill are Laikipia, Kisii, Siaya, Kisumu, Kajiado, West Pokot, Busia, Trans Nzoia and Homa Bay. So far, only Baringo County has rejected the Bill. Twenty-four out of 47 counties are required to pass the Bill
