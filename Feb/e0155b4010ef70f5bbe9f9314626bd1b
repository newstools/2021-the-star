Diamond Platnumz’s manager, Sallam SK, attacked former Wasafi signee Harmonize a few days ago. In a long rant, Sallam called him a rat for going to the authorities over Rayvanny’s supposed sexual offence against prospective stepdaughter Paula. Harmonize has remained mum about the attack until his girlfriend Frida Kajala spoke out. Kajala took to Instagram to post a picture of the two having a nice time together, captioning it, "You'll never be right for the wrong person." Harmonize transformed the snitch innuendo to positivity, affirming his love to Kajala with what was meant to be degrading to Sallam SK. He wrote, "Love you, panya jike." Sallam and Harmonize have been beefing over a long period. He snubbed the 'Atarudi' hitmaker during Babu Tale's wife's burial. While asked why, Sallam said, "Harmonize has never greeted me for about three years now, even from when he was at WCB. So, I never saw the need for a handshake that particular day, yet has snubbed me on many occasions." In his rant, Sallam had referred to Harmonize as a snitch, saying he has been pretending he cares about Rayvanny’s well-being, but in the real sense he wants him detained. "Kuna Panya mmoja amekesha kituo cha polisi kulazimisha msanii mwenzie awekwe ndani lakini kutokana na sheria ya nchi haipo mkononi mwake, ikabidi akimbilie kwenye media kujifanya anaomba suluhu kuwa yeye anataka amani na anamuombea asipate matatizo," he said. "Huyo Panya anahangaika ili msanii mwenzie apate matatizo…. nikupe taarifa ndugu panya dua zako wala maombi yako hatuyahitaji labda uyapeleke Hospital kufanikisha kizazi chako kiwe bora na uweze kulea mtoto wako binafsi na sio mtoto wa kukodi…"
