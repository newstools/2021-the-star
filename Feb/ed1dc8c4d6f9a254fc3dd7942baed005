Two people were on Tuesday arrested in Mombasa Old Town with heroin valued at Sh6 million. Police said the two kilos of the narcotics were found in the house of the man and woman during the raid. This follows a raid by the officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations who said they found the two packages with brownish granules and that they were informed the two were suppliers. The packages were marked with numbers 777 and it is not clear what that means. The drugs were taken for further analysis while the suspects were expected in court to face various charges. Heroin is one of the most trafficked and consumed narcotics at the Coast and the country at large. Other most trafficked and abused narcotics include cocaine and other psychotropic substances. Apart from these narcotics, alcohol, miraa, prescription drugs, tobacco, marijuana and inhalants are also widely consumed. Police say traffickers now use roads as opposed to airports to carry out their business. The most commonly trafficked narcotics from Tanzania and through Uganda is heroin. In 2019, the European Union Ambassador to Kenya Simon Mordue said the Kenyan port of Mombasa accounted for 30 per cent of illegal heroin smuggled into the EU market. He said they had engaged Kenyan authorities to handle the issue. Mordue said they are working closely with the various agencies to reverse this trend, get intelligence and the police to nab the peddlers. The revelations were not new to some government officials who know the trend of the business. Most of the heroin in the country originate from Afghanistan through the Indian Ocean. Kenyan security agencies seized the second-biggest haul of cocaine weighing 100 kilos and valued at Sh598 million in 2016 in Mombasa that was disguised as sugar. The case was however later dismissed in court.
