A Form Three student in Kwale has committed suicide following an alleged school punishment. The 21-year-old, at a Secondary School in Shimba Hills killed himself after being suspended from school for two weeks. The deceased is said to have caused a commotion at the school prompting the school management to send him home as a disciplinary action. He hanged himself in his bedroom some hours after reaching home on Thursday evening. Kwale police confirmed the incident. According to a close relative, the deceased was found playing violently with a colleague forcing a teacher to discipline them before being sent away. “They were found fighting jokingly but a teacher took it seriously asking the two to kneel down and suspended them afterwards,” he said. It is said the student was received by his grandmother who left for prayers after thoroughly questioning him as to why he was home. The grandmother later was shocked to see him hanging motionless when she got back from a nearby church. Students and parents protested over his death following the school to be shut down indefinitely. Matuga sub-county education director Martin Cheruiyot didn’t respond to the allegations. Kwale police admitted students caused some chaos but order was later restored. The student left a suicide note behind explaining how life has been hard on him, according to another relative. The deceased was an orphan, raised in an orphanage and lived under the care of his granny. The relative said the student was very disciplined boy and wasn’t on any drugs but is also said to have told his friends that he was going to do something bad. “We don’t know what happened but he used to communicate to his age mates that one day he will carry out secret plans coming from his head,” said a relative. The body was taken to Kwale mortuary for postmortem. Police investigations have commenced.
