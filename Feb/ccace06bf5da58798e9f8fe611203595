Ford Kenya party is set to make some key changes to strengthen it ahead of the 2022 general elections. The party management committee agreed that there is an urgent need for key changes as there are officials who have resigned in the run-up to the Matungu and Kabuchai by-elections. The agreement comes after a meeting held at KICC which was chaired by Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula. The meeting that was attended by more than half of the members discussed some issues, including the Kabuchai by-elections. Chris Mandu Mandu, the Ford Kenya National Organizing Secretary said that the changes will help fill the gaps left out members who have  resigned “There is no vacuum in the party, all posts must be refilled to enable the party to run its business as agreed upon,” he said. Bernard Wakoli who until his resignation was the National Youth League leader will be replaced by Chekai Musa alias Kanali. Wakoli resigned to vie for the Matungu parliamentary seat following the demise of Justus Murunga. Musa will oversee the post until the National Delegates Conference is held. Peter Kapanga who also resigned was the NEC member for county coordination where Steve Apopo will hold the post until the party's NDC. Kapanga is vying for the Kabuchai parliamentary seat as an independent candidate following the death of James Lusweti. “We take this opportunity to congratulate those who have had the opportunity to take to the helm and wish them all the best in their service,” Mandu Mandu said. Ford Kenya has faced a lot of challenges following the coup that was undertaken by a group allied to Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. The matter is currently pending in court.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
