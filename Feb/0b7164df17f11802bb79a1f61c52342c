National Super League side Shabana will not overhaul their squad in the current transfer window. Club vice chairman Nyandoro Kambi and interim head coach Joseph Ongoro ruled out any big changes in the team. Kambi said they are only looking to sign an experienced goalkeeper and defender. Kambi ruled out the return of two former players who left the club acrimoniously last year.  “There is harmony and teamwork in the team currently. We don’t want to disrupt that,” said Kambi. Ongoro said he is okay with the current team which comprises players aged between 18 and 23. “My policy is to develop and mentor young players. I will work with the club management to come up with a youth development policy,” said the coach. He added: “It will be unfair for me to drop any player in the current window. These boys have worked hard and they all deserve to be in the team. My priority is to get a goalkeeper because that’s where I feel there is some weakness,” said Ongoro. Shabana’s first-choice goalkeeper Dennis Ayusa is likely to leave in the current transfer window after losing his starting place to Felix Otieno. Ayusa is being courted by former Kenya Premier League champions Sony, where about 10 former players are plying their trade. Ongoro has guided the team to fourth place on the log, with 14 points, four behind log leaders Kenya Police. Second-placed Fortune Sacco is on 17 points while Ken Kenyatta’s FC Talanta is third with 16 points. Ongoro remains unbeaten since he took over from Vincent Nyaberi. The team has won four matches and drawn one against Modern Coast in Mombasa. Ongoro is keen to maintain the good run when the team play 10th placed Silibwet Leones at Bomet Stadium on Sunday.
