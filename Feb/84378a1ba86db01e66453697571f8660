The US government has revealed that there are significant cases of Covid-19 in Tanzania. This is just a week after it advised its citizens against travelling to the East African country. "The US Embassy is aware of a significant increase in the number of Covid-19 cases since January 2021," the Embassy said. In a Health alert, the US said the practice of Covid-19 mitigation and prevention measures remains limited. The Tanzanian government has not released aggregate numbers on Covid-19 cases or deaths since April 2020. "Healthcare facilities in Tanzania can become quickly overwhelmed in a healthcare crisis.  Limited hospital capacity throughout Tanzania could result in life-threatening delays for emergency medical care," US said. The Department of State’s travel advisory level for Tanzania is Level 3. The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention says that travellers should avoid all travel to Tanzania. The Embassy continues to recommend that all individuals take caution in day-to-day activities. President John Magufuli assured the 58 million inhabitants that they need not worry about observing Covid-19 preventative measures. He also vowed last year that his country would never face curfews or lockdowns.
