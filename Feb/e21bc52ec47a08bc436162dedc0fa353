Fast-rising Nigerian singer, songwriter Morien has released the visual to his latest release, 'Plenty Money'. The Etin Records frontline act described the song as an easily relatable song inspired by a hustler's spirit to reap from their labour. "It is a daily positive prayer that should be repeated before the start of the day," he said in a statement. His previous single, 'Maria', gained a lot of attention on the international scene and put Morien on the radar of top music executives. The singer started music at a very tender age and over the years his passion for music continues to grow. Morien plans to tour Kenya and East Africa before the year ends for possible collaborations with top Kenyan acts and also perform for his Kenyan fans.
