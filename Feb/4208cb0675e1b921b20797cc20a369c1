The government will identify and train 26,451 health workers to conduct Covid-19 vaccination targeting 15 million people by 2023. According to a brief prepared by the Council of Governors and presented to the counties ahead of rollout starting mid-March, the vaccination will be rolled out in three phases. Each of the 15 million people targeted will receive at least two doses of the vaccine. Phase one which targets 1.25 million people will cover frontline health workers, service delivery workers in health facilities, teachers and non-teaching staff. Also targeted in this phase are military, prisons officers, immigration and religious leaders. Phase two that will start towards the end of the year will target individuals who are over 50 years old and those above 18 but living with cancer, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular and renal diseases and HIV. Others are those dealing with obesity, neurologic conditions, blood disorders and individuals in the hospitality industry. Workers in care homes, prisons, detention centres, street families, informal settlements, entertainment industry, restaurants and banking sector will be vaccinated in phase three. “The vaccination will be rolled out in three phases to progressively cover all target groups based on vaccine availability. Phases may overlap,” the brief says. For one to get the vaccine, he or she will be required to register at a subcounty health facility which the county government will have identified as the vaccination centre. “Scheduling and communication to recipients on vaccination days, for specific vaccination sites will be made,” the brief points out. The brief says deployment and vaccination plan for the programme will cost Sh34 billion over 30 months.
