Tuned by the maestros themselves, PaceSol earbuds deliver stellar sound quality, packaged in comfortable, easy to wear, water-resistant, Bluetooth buds, which are trendy, durable and affordable. Bien said they wanted to create a product that sums them up as a group. "Part lifestyle, part activewear and part musical excellence." Chimano added, "PaceSol is a product you can use anywhere and look good, and not compromise on your listening experience." PaceSol is the first product in a range of future products to come from the partnership and will focus on introducing unique but affordable tech products into the region. From audio to wearable to mobility tech, the partnership is focused on providing global solutions for the African market that are conceptualised, built and made for Africa by Africans.

"This partnership with Sauti Sol is a dovetail as we share the same value and passion for delivering meaningful experiences. Therefore, we know that our fans and consumers will enjoy the PaceSol experience.”
