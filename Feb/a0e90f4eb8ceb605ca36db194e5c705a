About 190 public health facilities in Nakuru are to be supplied with Sh100 million medical stock by the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Acting Kemsa CEO Edward Njoroge said the authority has expanded its range of products to serve better its customers like Nakuru county by increasing access to quality and affordable healthcare to its more than two million residents. The health facilities comprise hospitals, health centres and dispensaries. “I would like to commend Nakuru county for the flag off and identifying Kemsa as its first point of call in ordering for health products and technologies,” Njoroge said. He noted that Nakuru county and Kemsa have collaborated well in the past and the delivery of the consignment of medical supplies will further enhance their cooperation. Njoroge said the consignment delivered to Nakuru is based on the specific needs of the county as per the data generated by its department of Health. He said the authority is accelerating processing the county order requests within delivery schedule through its robust supply chain infrastructure. “We will continue to work with other counties to deliver on their healthcare promises and guarantee uninterrupted supply of essential medicine,” he added. The CEO also announced that Kemsa has a strong infrastructure that creates a not for profit, self-sustaining commercial institution that at its best offers effective and affordable health care services to the public. "As a result of this, I would like to urge the county governments to fulfil their commitment to ensuring uninterrupted supply of medical commodities and business continuity of the organisation,” he said. "Kemsa will continue to enhance service delivery through on time deliveries of health products and technologies to various Counties for a sustainable healthcare development,” he noted. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
