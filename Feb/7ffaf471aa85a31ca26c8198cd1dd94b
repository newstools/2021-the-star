Great Rift Valley Golf Resort professional golfer Justas Madoya is looking forward  to the last leg of Safari Tour Golf Series starting this Sunday at the Par 71 Karen Golf Club. Currently ranked ninth with 182.0 points after the eighth leg event last week at Muthaiga, Madoya says he will be heading to Karen with the aim to win if not finish among the top five. Madoya won on the home turf during the sixth leg of series when he fired three over par 287 to beat Zimbabwean Robson Chinhoi and Thika Sports Club’s Simon Ngige by three shots. “I will be heading to Karen with the sole purpose of enjoying the four-day event  but winning will not be far from my mind,” said Madoya who played at Limuru, Vetlab, Sigona, Great Rift, Nyali and Muthaiga. He skipped the Royal Nairobi and Uganda Open meetings. “ I am training well on my home course in readiness for the final meeting in Karen and Magical Kenya Open,” said Madoya. In 2019, Madoya alongside Simon Ngige of Golf Park, were the only Kenyans who made the cut during the Magical Kenya Open at the Karen Club. However, that is not what he is looking forward to this season after the 2020 event was cancelled due to coronavirus pandemic. “With 12 professional golfers making the cut into the Kenya Open, I am optimistic of playing well,” added Madoya. The Safari Tour Series is supposed to present pros with the perfect environment for training before the big event. As Madoya sits in the 9th position, Muthaiga’s Greg Snow leads to table on 322.2 points ahead of Mumias’ Dismas Indiza (309.5) and Zimbabwean Chinhoi (292.1) ends top three positions.
