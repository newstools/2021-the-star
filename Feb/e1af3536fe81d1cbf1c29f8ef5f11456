Former World Half Marathon record holder Geoffrey Kamworor wants to set a new world record on his return to action after a year out due to injuries. Kamworor said his injuries have healed and is raring to assault the current record of 57.32 that was set by countryman Kibiwott Kandie at the Valencia Marathon on December 6 last year. "I am confident I can set a new world record and I am determined to do it. I am feeling fit and with more training and time, I am sure I will reach my peak condition and produce the kind of performances I had before my injury problems," Kamworor said. The 2019 New York Marathon champion said he was gutted about his injury problems last year because he had planned on competing in various international events. "I wanted to defend my title last year and work hard towards breaking my own world record. However, all that is in the past and I am more optimistic about 2021 because there will be many races for me to compete," Kamworor said. He was full of praise for Kandie — the man who succeeded him as the race's fastest runner — describing him as a great athlete. "He is a great man and a hardworking athlete. I believe the future is bright for him and will go very far in his career. I was very happy to see him set a new world Half Marathon record," he said. The two are set to meet at the Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon in the United Arab Emirates on February 19 alongside World Half Marathon champion Jacob Kiplimo of Uganda. Apart from the half marathon meet, the two could meet again at the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics as both have expressed  interest in running for Team Kenya in the 10,000m. "For sure, I will be seeking to compete in the 10,000m in Tokyo. After RAK, I will resume training for this track race," Kamworor said. Kamworor stormed to victory at the National Police Service Cross Country Championships men's 10km race at Ngong Racecourse on Friday in his first competitive assignment since overcoming his injury woes.
