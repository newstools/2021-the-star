Kisumu All Starlets team manager Beryl Oketch wants her charges to be solid defensively and ruthless in front of goal ahead of the second leg of the Football Kenya Federation Women's Premier League. Oketch was disappointed as Kisumu dropped two points in a 2-2 all draw against a hard-fighting Wadadia at Moi Stadium, Kisumu on Sunday. Kisumu dropped to fifth place with 11 points. She said it was a fair result, adding that Wadadia deserved point as they were the better side. “It’s a fair result but the girls did not play according to our script. Credit to Wadadia, they executed their play properly,” said Oketch. “We should move away from shaky defending that proved costly. Attacking-wise, there’s room for improvement. We need to score when we have chances.” Wadadia coach Rashid Sumba was unimpressed with officiating. He, however, congratulated the players for the point, the first on the venue in seven encounters. “It wasn’t a penalty and everybody was wondering what the referee was thinking. Coming from behind is not easy and the whole team put up a spirited fight to salvage the point. We have never won or drawn in this field since 2017 and this result will motivate us,” Sumba said. Jecinta Nyambok had given the hosts the lead, converting a 26th-minute penalty but the lead lasted only four minutes. Ruth Chebungei brought Wadadia back into the game with a cool finish. Starlets regained their lead seven minutes before halftime as Christine Awour popped up with a sublime goal beating Wadadia’s Monica Odato in goal. The lively Chebungei completed her brace in the second half to share the spoils. Nyambok was shown a red card in the dying minutes of the encounter. Wadadia remain third with 13 but with inferior goal difference against second-placed Trans Nzoia Falcons. Elsewhere, Nakuru West Queens beat SEP Oyugis 3-2 to move to fourth on the table with 12 points.
