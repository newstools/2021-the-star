Businesswoman Yvette Obura, the mother of Bahati's first child,  says State House spokesperson Kanze Dena helped her get over a nasty backlash from social media. Speaking to Massawe Japanni on Radio Jambo, the mother of one was asked to speak about the worst troll she has ever had on social media. "The worst was when I was super heavy and it was the first time I appeared on 'Being Bahati' reality show. I was super big, 98kgs." Yvette recounted how she almost fell into depression as she was not used to trolls. She used the hurtful words from the trolls to motivate her to lose weight. "I lost 20kg in a year through intermittent fasting. The longest I did was a week with just taking water. Now I just do it to maintain my weight." Kanze Dena recently trended on Twitter after her first appearance to the public after her maternity leave. Yvette said in her doldrums, the State House spokesperson looked for her phone number and reached out to her. "When I saw what was happening on social media, I also reached out to her. Unfortunately her phone number was busy but just seeing those comments made me feel so bad," she said. "This is even worse when it comes from women. Women should understand that we go through a lot, you don’t even know what someone is going through." Yvette added that however strong one is, those trolls affect them. "Why would you make it your business. People out there will never understand because it brings you down kabisa. No matter how strong you are. Lazima it will bring you down."
