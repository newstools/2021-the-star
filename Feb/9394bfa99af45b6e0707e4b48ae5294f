 A family in Manga, Nyamira county, has appealed to the government to help investigate circumstances that led to the sudden death of their relative on Friday night. Daniel Ragira is said to have been in good health when he left his house at around 7pm on Friday for the nearby Magombo market only to be reported dead two hours later. Rariga's brother Tom Mboya, said he received a call at around 9pm informing him of the death. “We are requesting investigation officers to interrogate the two attendants at Relax Inn Bar in Magombo market, who took my brother to Roman Maternity and Nursing Home Hospital where he was pronounced dead. They should explain the cause of my brother’s death,” Mboya said. Janet Mekonge, another family member, said her brother-in-law was in good health when he left the house for the trading centre that evening. “My brother was not unwell, his sudden death is shocking and raises questions. We want police to investigate the death,” she said. Ragira was reportedly found lying outside Relax Inn Bar by two bar attendants identified as Jackson Oguru and Benard Gichana and since they are said to have known him well, they tried to wake him up unsuccessfully. That is when they reportedly took him to the hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival. His body was taken to Tombe Medicare Centre pending postmortem. Edited by Sarah Kanyara
