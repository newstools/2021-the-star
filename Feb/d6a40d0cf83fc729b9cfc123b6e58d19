Nzoia Sugar head coach Ibrahim Shikanda has said he will not jump into the market to sign new players during this transfer window. Shikanda, who has lost three key players, said he will instead go for local untapped talents and nurture them into Premier League material. Shikanda said he is content with his squad despite losing Erick Otieno, Felix Oluoch and Mustapha Oduor. "Oluoch is heading to Zoo Kericho, Otieno to Wazito FC and Oduor to Vihiga United," Shikanda said. “I trust the rest of the members of the playing unit to get the job done in the remaining part of the season. I will be moving to the grassroots to seek young and fresh talents in remote areas to nature them and bring them on board,” he said. Shikanda said nurturing young players is his objective with a view to making them future superstars. “Nurturing a player ensure you exactly know what you need out of him compared to the star you have picked on the market,” added Shikanda. Nzioa are placed 11th with as many points alongside Kakamega Homeboyz and Sofapaka. Vihiga United tactician Sammy Okoth confirmed that they are working on Oduor's transfer but it's not a done deal yet.
