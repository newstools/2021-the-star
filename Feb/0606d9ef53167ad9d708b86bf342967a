Three men have been arrested for printing fake police clearance certificates and identity cards in Eldoret. The three were also found with fake Academic documents, among other documents. George Kiplagat, Alex Kibet and Washington Omondi are believed to be part of a wider syndicate of fraudsters, DCI George Kinoti said on Saturday. Kinoti said the suspects areÂ defrauding unsuspecting members of the public within Eldoret town and its environs. He cautioned that The Directorate of Criminal Investigations, is the only institution mandated to issue Police Clearance Certificates and as such, any other clearance certificates issued from elsewhere are not only null and void, but could also land the bearer in trouble. Early in the week, Kenya National Qualifications of Authority and the DCI agreed to work together in handling academic fraud in the country. KNQA disclosed that a third of Kenyans have fake academic documents and therefore the need to take action against such individuals. The team is expected to expedite its work and net the suspects who use the documents for employment.
