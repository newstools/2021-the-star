Harmonize has called out Rayvanny for being involved with a Form 5 student. The 'Ushamba' hitmaker told his former label mate this is a capital offence. "Why did you record a video kissing her? Was your intention to show you are above the law? Look at how you've affected her future. If it's true both of you are in love, was the video recording necessary?" wrote Harmonize on Instagram. The singer said this after Rayvanny's cosy video with Paula went viral. Adding, "Why don't you just make music? You don't need to get yourself into things like this." Harmonize is currently dating Paula's mother, actress Kajala Masanja, who has threatened to take action against the WCB member. Rayvanny is yet to respond to the issue.
