Abagusii elders have condemned the fight between Dagoreti North MP Simba Arati and his South Mugirango counterpart Silvanus Osoro at the funeral of Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi’s father. The Abagusii Cultural and Development Council of Elders, led by their chairman James Matundura, described the Monday incident as shameful, unfortunate and inconsiderate to the bereaved family. Matundura appealed to society to respect burials as cultural events. The council released a protocol on the conduct of burials going forward. The burial rules include barring politics and banning cheering and jeering of politicians. He said the fight during Mzee Abel Gongera’s funeral was a disgrace to the family because the deceased was a gentleman who had helped his community by donating his land to for construction of a nearby church and school. Matundura said the council will soon meet with the church and other community leaders to determine the deterrence action to be taken against those who abuse cultural values. Meanwhile, the elders expressed their grief following the death of former Cabinet Minister Simeon Nyachae, who was the council’s patron. They conveyed their condolences to the family and the Abagusii community at large for losing the community leader whom they described as an icon of good leadership.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
