Two-time East Africa Junior champion Agnes Jebet is optimistic of staging a great show when she takes her bow in the senior ranks during the Africa Cross Country Championships in Lome, Togo next month. Jebet finished fourth in the 6km junior race on her debut at the Africa Cross in Algeria three years ago and has vowed to improve on that performance on March 7. “I am new in the senior ranks but this will not pull me back as I seek to propel my career further up at the Lome event," said Jebet. Jebet, a past East Africa junior champion over 5,000m and 3,000m races said she has been competing in middle distance races and wants to leave a mark in her first appearance at the continental show. “I am good on both track and cross country and this is the level that I can prove how good I am. With my speed and courage, I am confident I can take on experienced runners both nationally and internationally,” added Jebet, who trains under coach Ruth Bundotich. Coming from Kamwosor Junior Athletics Training camp in Elgeyo Marakwet County, Jebet was named in Team Kenya senior women's squad alongside two-time national cross country champion Sheila Chelangat of National Police Service, her compatriot Daisy Cherotich (Central Rift), world marathon champion Ruth Chepngetich (Nairobi), Evaline Chirchir and former world 3,000m steeplechase champion Hyvin Kiyeng.
