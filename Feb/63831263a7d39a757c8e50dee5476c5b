Four suspects were arraigned on Tuesday at the Milimani Law Courts for defrauding innocent Kenyans through SIM swapping and using SIM cards of deceased people to steal. Eugene Shivachi, Morris Koome, Eutycus Mutembei, Jane Wacuka, and Clara Davies were arrested on Monday. Appearing before Milimani Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku, Mutembei and Shivachi were charged for using the late Amos Ngatia Muiruri's credentials to steal from his various bank accounts. Mutembei and Shivachi took a plea on 12 counts of stealing, conspiracy to commit a felony, unauthorized access, and preparation to commit a felony. Mutembei is a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Statistics graduate from the University of Nairobi. Shivachi is a taxi driver ad both are land brokers The magistrate released the two on a cash bail of Sh500,000 each and directed them to provide two contact persons. In the second related file, Mutembei and Shivachi were charged alongside Morris Koome Riungu and Jane Wacuka Gathogo with stealing 39 SIM cards from different mobile phone subscribers. They were released on a cash bail of Sh200,000 each. The four were arraigned following high-profile investigations by our detectives who unraveled a major SIM swap scam. The high-tech phone scammers hijack the victim’s cell phone number and use it to gain access to his/her sensitive personal data and bank accounts through the Mobile Banking Apps available on Android and other smartphones. The detectives said that it is through Ngata’s theft that they made a breakthrough in the major SIM-swap fraud through which the dead and the living have lost millions of shillings. Ngata was a businessman in Nairobi. The syndicate mostly targets wealthy individuals – especially those who have died and their families placed their death announcements in newspapers. The fraudsters also target telephone lines of the elderly and those who have travelled abroad.
