WCB's Rayvanny says life was tough way before fame. In a recent interview, he said that having been brought up in the village, he had tried in vain to talk to people in Dar to help him get to the city. He had to hitch a ride in a lorry that was heading in that direction and could not be more grateful to the driver, who happened to know him. Rayvanny had packed clothes but they were all ruined by some liquid that does not get off. "I stayed at a place for like a whole month with just one pair of clothes. It was a purple T-shirt and a red pencil trouser. I used to turn the clothes inside out whenever they got dirty." He later met Diamond's manager Babu Tale, who took him into Wasafi. He is now among the most successful musicians in East Africa.
