Nzoia Sugar insist they will not be cowed by Tusker's scintillating form when the two teams lock horns in a Football Kenya Federation Premier League match at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The brewers are in a class of their own this season, having won their last six matches and have been tipped to end Gor Mahia's KPL dominance. However, Nzoia, who are brimming with confidence after silencing title-chasing KCB 2-1 last weekend at the Sudi Stadium, have promised to hand Tusker their second loss of the season. Tusker sit at the summit with 29 points from 12 rounds while Nzoia are currently placed 12th with 14 points. "We are not afraid of their form, name or quality of players. We are coming for the three points. This will be possible if my players remain disciplined and play to the instructions," said Nzoia head coach Ibrahim Shikanda. "We know Tusker have been punishing teams in the second half through their substitutions but we are ready for them." In another match lined up for the day, Bandari will be seeking their sixth win of the season when they host Vihiga United at the Mbaraki Stadium. The dockers — who have been heavily linked with former Sofapaka striker Umaru Kasumba — made yet another statement in their bid to fortify their backyard after sinking AFC Leopards 2-1 last weekend, a result which will certainly inspire them ahead of Vihiga's visit. The league returnees will, on the other hand, be seeking to redeem themselves from last weekend's 1-0 loss to Kariobangi Sharks at the Mumias Sports Complex. Meanwhile, the clash pitting defending champions Gor and Posta Rangers, which was initially set for Tuesday at the Kasarani Annex has been moved to next month. The league body is understood to have rescheduled the match to hand K'Ogalo sufficient time to rest after arriving from Lusaka, Zambia on Sunday night. Gor faced Napsa on Sunday afternoon in a CAF Confederations Cup play-off match where they drew 2-2 to bow out of the competition on a 3-2 aggregate score.
