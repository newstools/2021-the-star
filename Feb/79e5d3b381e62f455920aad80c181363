There are no signs of stopping for the ever-increasing unruliness in the public service industry. If anything, it gets nastier everyday. Matatus have no respect for law and order. Only once during the then bullish Transport minister John Michuki did we have some sobriety on the roads. And Kenyans seem to have accepted the matatu notoriety on the roads. The traffic police, too, do very little about matatu crews who are law unto themselves. Who will fix the matatu indiscipline? How did this monster outgrow us? And who dropped the ball? Simple. Our culture of silence allowed this evil to thrive and before we knew it, things were out of hand. Matatus have collectively abducted our consciousness, safety and road freedom. We can only watch as they overlap, speed, overload and terrorise other road users. We only watch helplessly as they screen all manner of videos and play loud music to the level of bursting our eardrums. We cannot do anything. We allowed it to thrive and now we have lost it. Matatu industry is now an organised criminal gang. We surrendered to it. Through our collective silence, we encouraged and cheered on as this culture was budding. Now it has flourished and become the new order of doing things. For sanity to return on our roads, it must start with you and me. We must choose to do the right thing no matter the cost. The other day I boarded a full matatu. I refused the tout's attempt to add excess passengers. I put on a solitary fight and insisted on the right carrying capacity. Other passengers gave me disgusting looks. I stood firm. Nonetheless, I lost and was ejected. I, however, don't regret for I stood up for the right thing.
