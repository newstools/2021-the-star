The National Assembly has prioritised for debate and approval, the Referendum Bill No. 2 of 2020 sponsored by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee. Speaker Justin Muturi announced this in a communication delivered during Thursday's late evening sitting. He further guided that members consider incorporating elements of the Referendum Bill sponsored by the Constitution Implementation Oversight Committee (CIOC). This was after the two committees failed to reach an agreement on a consolidated referendum legislation. The House teams had retreated on several occasions where preliminary agreements were reached but non was ratified. Muturi said the CIOC Bill would be revived should the one by JLAC be defeated at any stage. The Bill is at the second reading stage. "An analysis of the two referendum Bills confirms that the Bill by the Departmental Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs emanated from prolonged engagements between the Committee and IEBC from as far back as 2015," Muturi said. "This is a product of very high-level consultations," said Minority Leader John Mbadi. Referendum questions, timelines for processing a bill by popular initiative, public participation are among issues members are deliberating on as provided for in the proposed legislation.
