At least 60 per cent of learners under the Competency-based Curriculum will join technical colleges, Education PS Julius Jwan has said. He said a large proportion of learners completing 12 years of basic of education will have acquired the technical and vocational skills that the job market requires. The PS said the success of the CBC is tied to that of a proper foundation of  Technical and Vocational Education and Training  (TVET) systems. Jwan spoke Wednesday when he handed over the Department of Vocational and Technical Training to incoming CAS Hassan Noor Hassan and PS Margaret Mwakima at Jogoo House. In the changes made by President Uhuru Kenyatta, eight principal secretaries were reshuffled and eight new CASs appointed. PS Belio Kipsang moved from the Education ministry to the State Department for Regional and Northern Corridor Development. Before the changes, Noor was Sports and Culture CAS while Mwakima was the Northern Corridor Development PS. Noor expressed concern that many youths shunned TVET courses. He said the ministry should help change the mindsets of youth towards vocational and technical occupations. Mwakima said vocational and technical occupations were noble and clean as they required practical skills. “We need somebody who can make a bed, not one who can talk about it,” she said. She said she would work with staff and other stakeholders to ensure the government transforms TVET in ways that serve the Big Four agenda more effectively and efficiently.
