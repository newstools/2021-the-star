Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM) party leader Isaac Rutto has given the clearest indication he is not going to fold his party ahead of 2022 General Election. Rutto, who spoke at Mogoiywet in Bomet central on Saturday, however, maintained that his support for Deputy President William Ruto in his presidential bid was unwavering. He said he will be vying for the gubernatorial seat on his CCM party and DP Ruto was also free to use any party he likes since he will also vote for him. There has been pressure on Rutto from his supporters asking him to join UDA. But Rutto said CCM party, just like the newly formed United Democratic Alliance (UDA) political outfit associated with the DP, has similar vision for the people hence no need to fold it. Both parties, he noted, are keen on supporting the common man in the grassroots level. “We know William is going for the top seat and we shall fully support him on that whether he uses UDA or switches to another party we are still going to vote for him,” said Rutto. He said: “What is of importance in a political party is the symbol and philosophy…CCM and UDA are one.” He further stated that there was nothing wrong with politicians changing parties. He at the same time took on the Jubilee government claiming it has continued to turn a blind eye on the plight of tea farmers in the region. He wondered why coffee and dairy farmers across the country were receiving support from the government while those in the tea sector are being "oppressed" with  taxes.
