Singer Bahati says he does not take offence when his fans refer to him as 'Mtoto wa Diana'. In an Instagram post, Bahati said he once told his wife while they were still dating that he wished she could love him as his mother did. "This is because I had grown up in a children's home set-up, and as an orphan, I always wished I had someone to call mum," he wrote. "Everyone, no matter how old, still yearns for some mother's love. And so these days, when they call me 'Mtoto wa Diana', I take no offence because this girl here is still the closest typa love I have had to my mama's #RIPmama." Diana in a past interview said she is two years older than Bahati, explaining that she used to get offended when people referred to her as Bahati's aunty. "I am only two years older than Bahati. In the beginning, it used to get to me, but what matters right now is how he takes care of me."
