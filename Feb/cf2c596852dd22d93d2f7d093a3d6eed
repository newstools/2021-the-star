Farmers from Buuri in Meru county will be trained in agricultural markets so they can plant only produce with a ready market. Water Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki said the training will be conducted for farmers' groups in April. Sicily said the national government has invested Sh3.3 billion for water projects in the county to help alleviate food shortage and dependence on relief support. The Sh284 million Kirua-Buuri Water Project will supply water for irrigation in Kirua-Ntumburi-Kwa Mungania, Kirua-Mbaria-Nkando-Maili Saba and Kirua-Kithwene-Njuruta-Ruiri Rwarera. She spoke at Buuri East DCC grounds on Saturday while inspecting ongoing construction of Kiirua Buuri irrigation project. Sicily was accompanied by Public Service and Gender CS Margaret Kobia and Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi. Kiraitu said he has sunk 24 boreholes in Buuri and ensured water connections including the Sh30 million Nturukuma water project. He said with enough water, people will get quick riches and overcome challenges of food scarcity and reliance on relief food. Sicily said the ministry has instructed the National Irrigation Authority to map underground water for supply in the county. “President Uhuru Kenyatta’s agenda is on transforming lives. The water project is Uhuru’s own initiative. I am pleased the Kiirua Buuri water project will serve farmers by May this year. All farmers will be trained for maximum benefits,” Kariuki said. CS Kobia said due to hardships she faced when growing up in the dry Buuri, she lobbied for the water project and was happy the President is behind it. “I am born here. The challenges of lack of water, electricity, poor roads and others you endure today were worse during my childhood,” Kobia said. She said the Railway line from Nairobi to Nanyuki and its planned extension to Isiolo will ease transport for farmers' produce.
