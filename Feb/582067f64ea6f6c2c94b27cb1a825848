ODM leader Raila Odinga on Wednesday said they are not worried with the court order barring IEBC from facilitating the BBI referendum. The Building Bridges Initiative suffered a major blow on Monday after the High CourtÂ  barred IEBC from presenting the constitutional amendment Bill 2020 to the county assemblies for deliberation. In a ruling delivered by a five-judge bench, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission was temporarily stopped from submitting the Bill to the counties pending hearing and determination of seven petitions filed challenging the process. But on Wednesday, Raila displayed confidence saying the process of law change at the assemblies and parliament will not be affected. "We are not worried, the courts also know the urgency of the matter. By the time the matter will be coming up to the IEBC, they shall have resolved the matter," Raila said. Speaking when he met the 34 chairmen of both ODM and Jubilee parties drawn from 17 Nairobi constituencies, Raila said the process will continue as scheduled. He noted that ODM and Jubilee will join forces to popularise the document and ensure it sails through when it will be subjected to a vote. The initiative he noted will rope in other parties supportive of the law change initiative. "We have resolved to move together as Jubilee and ODM and we shall have other parties on board," Raila said. He was accompanied by MPs Simba Arati (Dagoretti North), George Aladwa (Makadara) and ODM Executive Director Oduor Ong'wen.
