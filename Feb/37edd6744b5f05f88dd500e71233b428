Dismas Indiza clung onto the summit of Safari Tour’s eighth leg at the par 71 Muthaiga Golf Club despite dropping two shots in each nine. This saw the long-hitter close the penultimate Round 3 on 1 over par 72 and three rounds gross total of four under par 209. With rounds of 72, 65, 72 over the past three rounds, Indiza holds a one-shot lead over Sigona pro Mohit Mediratta, whose rounds of  69, 72, 69 place him second with 3 under par 210 gross. Indiza oozed confidence from the start but missed a par at the par three-second, then birdied the fourth and sixth, but hit a bad approach shot at the ninth to drop his second shot of the day. He, however, started the back nine with zest and vigour, rolling in a birdie putt at the 10th. He, nevertheless, missed the greens at the 14th after a brilliant three-wood shot and then hit his second shot into the water at the 15th to pick up a double bogey. He then pitched to about a foot from the pin at the 17th for an easy birdie, before three-putting the par-five-18th for par after an impressive drive. “I was going for either eagle or a birdie at the 18th but I did not get the first putt well. But all in all, my game was not bad and I still have a great chance of winning tomorrow if I am able to play the way I played in the second round,” said Indiza, who will be joined by Mediratta and Zambia’s Dayne Moore in the final round at 8 am. Mediratta shot two under par 69, his second in the tournament for a total of three-under-par 210. He bogeyed the eighth after making birdies at the third and at the par five-seventh, while at the back nine, Mediratta who is chasing his first ever pro victory, birdied the 12th and 15th, bogeyed the 16th after missing the green, then like Indiza, he also three-putted the 18th for par. “I enjoyed my round in spite of the few shots I dropped but I still believe I have a good chance of winning here. All I need is to try and enjoy the round tomorrow, as I am playing with good players though I would like to play according to my plan and probably try and play a better round," said Mediratta, adding that the Muthaiga course is in an excellent condition. Moore, on the other hand, dropped two shots at the front nine with only one birdie at the fourth. At the back nine, he hit a brilliant drive for a nine-iron approach shot, for an easy eagle, but soon after, dropped a shot at the par-three-11th, hit his driver at the trees at the 18th, came out well but missed the greens to drop a shot which left him with one over par 72 and a three rounds total of one-under-par 212.
