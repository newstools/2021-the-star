DCI Detectives on Wednesday night arrested a suspected fraudster in Kilimani. According to a statement by the directorate on Thursday, the suspect identified as Yussuf Daniel Masara is a Nigerian National alleged to have obtained money by false pretenses. He allegedly convinced his victim, a U.S national, that he would sell him 50Kgs of gold valued at Sh17.6 Million. "However after failing to keep his end of the bargain, the matter was reported to detectives based at Kilimani leading to his arrest," the DCI said. The directorate believes Masara is part of a wider criminal enterprise, defrauding unsuspecting Kenyans of their money. This comes barely five months after the DCI sleuths arrested four suspectsÂ  for obtaining over Sh21 million from a Niger national. The police said the four lured the Niger man into the country in a gold deal scam. Seth Steve Okute , who was the prime suspect, was accused of luring the victim to his Lux Cargo Group offices at Siginon Warehouse within JKIA, in a plot he termed as following up on the victim's gold from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. The suspects obtained the said amount allegedly to expedite a rerouting process of the cargo to the desired destination, before disappearing and leaving the victim stranded. The police said that the four suspects were working alongside other three accomplices.
