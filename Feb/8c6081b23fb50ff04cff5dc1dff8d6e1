Mombasa governor Hassan Joho has submitted his presidential nomination papers to ODM as he promises to trounce other nominees. Speaking in Mombasa on Saturday, Joho said that he was optimistic he will fly ODM flag in 2022 polls . "I will go all the way my friend.. and if i win, they should support me... and i shall win.. I am sure I will trounce all the other ODM presidential nominees..." he said. "If Uhuru can win, I can, if Raila can win, i can..what is the difference?" he posed. ODM leader Raila Odinga could face Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and Joho in the battle for the party's 2022 presidential ticket. Last month, National Elections Board chair Catherine Mumma placed an advert asking interested candidates to pay Sh1 million non-refundable fee to participate in the nominations. The party's nominations, expected by February next year, would have the potential of putting behind the sting of the 2017 electoral defeat and getting on the launch pad for the 2022 presidential race. Applicants have up to 26th this month to submit their applications. The entry of Oparanya and Joho —  ODM's co-deputy party leaders— has raised the stakes in the contest for the coveted presidential ticket and opened a new battle front for what appears to be ODM's biggest assignment. From the onset, the contest for the ODM presidential flagbearer could appear an ordinary contest but deeper lie political undercurrents with huge implications on Raila's future career. Opponents seeking to influence the outcome of presidential nominations of rival parties could be the biggest worry for the rank and file of ODM in its bid to hand a third straight ticket to a flagbearer.
