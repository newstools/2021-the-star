 Seventeen people were on Monday arrested in Nyamira county for contravening Health ministry protocols to curb the spread of Covid-19. The 17 contravened rules including failure to wear masks, not observing curfew hours, consuming alcoholic drinks beyond curfew hours and selling of liquor beyond the curfew hours. Riontonyi OCS James Ng’eny who led security officers in the operation in Nderema and Isoge area in Borabu said they will not hesitate to arrest anyone contravening health directives to curb the spread of Coronavirus. Seven of those arrested were from the two Borabu areas. “There has been a lot of laxity among our people in adhering to health protocols to control spread of Covid-19 and a majority of residents are downplaying the disease saying it is an ailment for people in the western world forgetting that we have also buried hundreds of loved ones due to the disease,” Nge’ny said. “We will keep arresting those not adhering to health protocols as most of these people could be carriers of the disease unaware of the danger they are posing to everyone around them,” the OCS said. The other nine were arrested in Nyamira North for contravening curfew hours and consuming alcoholic drinks in public beyond curfew hours while one was arrested for selling alcoholic drinks to sit-in customers beyond curfew hours. Those arrested in Borabu will be arraigned at Keroka law courts while the rest will be arraigned at Nyamira law courts on Tuesday.  Edited by Sarah Kanyara
