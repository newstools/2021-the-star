Nyeri county is starting to digitise agricultural extension services because it cannot afford to appoint more extension officers ( see P24). The county has partnered with a call service provider to deliver extension services. Due to the growth in population, there is now only one extension officer per 4,000 livestock farmers and per 2,500 crop farmers. The recommended ratio is one extension officer to 400 farmers. The call centre answers questions from 600 farmers daily. If necessary, callers are referred to physical extension officers. Kenya is still an agricultural economy with farmers contributing around half of GDP. It needs more extension officers to farm efficiently. Long waits to reach call centres gobble up airtime. Moreover it is easier to explain a problem to an extension officer in person and that officer may spot other improvements that could be made in the shamba. The officer will also be able to report back to the county what is happening on the ground. So let counties not start phasing out extension officers. It will be a false economy. If counties appoint more competent extension officers, their farmers will prosper and increase tax revenue for local government.
