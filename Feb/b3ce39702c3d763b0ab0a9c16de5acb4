Six people died on Tuesday evening in a grisly road accident that in­volved a matatu and a lorry on Bondo –K­isumu highway near Katuju area. They included a three-year-old child. Rarieda subcounty police commander Everline Cherotich on Wednesday said two people died on the spot, wh­ile four others succ­umbed to their injuries while being rushed to Bondo Subcounty Ho­spital. Cherotich said the two vehicles collided head-on when the lorry, which was moving towards Bon­do town, swerved to avoid hitting a van whose driver had lost control. She said they co­uld not immediately determine the number of passengers who were on the matatu as some had been removed by road users and taken to hospital by the time the police arrived at the scene. They, however, launched investigations into the accident and cautioned motorists to be cautious when approaching the spot, saying another accident occurred there last weekend and one person died. Meanwhile, a sombre mood engulfed Bon­do Subcouty Hospital after Doreen Ang’a­sa, the facility's lab­oratory manager, peri­shed in another road ac­cident. Ho­spital staff had yet to come to terms with her demise. They described her as a humble team leader who had a listening ear for everyone around her.
