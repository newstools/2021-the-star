Woodley residents have sued to stop the intended redevelopment of their estate by the Nairobi Metropolitan Services. They say they were not involved nor consulted throughout the decision-making process. “NMS has not demonstrated willingness and ability to give an opportunity to the public before undertaking the proposed project,” their lawyer Simon Ndege said. The residents claim that the NMS illegally invited developers to submit designs and costs for redevelopment in January without public participation. They say NMS and Nairobi county failed to conduct an environmental and social impact assessment on the estate as required by law. “ESIA ought to have been done at the initial stage of the project before the letter of invitation to address issues such as effect on human health, drainage pattern, water resources and possibility of multiple use among others.” There was also no redevelopment plan for Woodley and strategic environmental assessment for the proposed urban renewal plan. The residents say NMS and Nairobi county did not give options and solutions in respect of the proposed project.
