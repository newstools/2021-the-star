The Council of Governors has rolled out a programme aimed at promoting peace between Nyamira and Kericho counties. Through women empowerment programmes in the two counties, the initiative has come up at a time when the country is preparing for a General Election next year. Kericho County Deputy Governor Susan Kikwai noted that the fact that both Nyamira and Kericho belong to the lake region economic block, there is need to live in harmony and the only way the communities can do so is by empowering women. Kikwai said the aim of the programme is to preach peace across communities in the country and more so promote empowerment for the women across the country. She spoke on Thursday at Matongo Lutheran Church where she was with Council of Governors CEO Jackline Omogeni. “We had a women empowerment meeting whose main focus is peace building because whether we are in the electioneering period or not, we need safety, security and peace for business to thrive and women are integral to that,” she said. The Council of Governors, Nyamira and Kericho counties are facilitating the programme where more than 200 women from the two neighbouring devolved units are taking part. Kikwai said 90 per cent of the labour in agriculture in the country is given by women and called for national and the county governments' support in value addition to the products. “Our women in the country need support in terms of value addition to their products so that they can move and develop our counties and promote peace as well,” she added. “Without peace development is impossible. As women from Nyamira, we encourage our colleagues from other communities to work together and ensure we promote cross-county trading so that women can be able to grow their economy,” said Omogeni. She said the initiative will also be rolled out in Kilifi to help in creating awareness on teenage pregnancies in the county. Edited by Sarah Kanyara
