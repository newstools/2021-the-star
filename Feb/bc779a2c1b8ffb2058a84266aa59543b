A Meru-based pastor has urged the government to print more BBI document copies to be distributed in churches. Duncan Kithinji of Hope Chapel Church in Meru town said this will help more Kenyans access, read and understand the document. “Very many people have so many questions and some are opposing without knowing what they are opposing, while others are agreeing blindly. There is a need for distribution of more copies, interpretation and civic education,” he said. Kithinji said many people will be reached through the church if copies are distributed. He said the copies should be given out in vernacular languages so that those that do not understand English and Kiswahili can understand. Almost all counties have passed the BBI bill. Only Baringo has so far rejected it. Kithinji said political leaders in the country should not polarise the country ahead of the 2022 general election. “They should avoid utterances that may trigger violence against their supporters or inter-tribal conflicts,” Kithinji said. He spoke on Tuesday at Hope Chapel in Meru, where they are expected to host ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi at a fundraiser on Sunday. Mudavadi will land in Kilunga, North Imenti constituency, and hold two fundraisers.
