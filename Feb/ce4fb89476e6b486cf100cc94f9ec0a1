A viral photo showing ODM leader  Raila Odinga held a Bible upside down is altered. A Facebook user Kipchumba Kirwa on his page shared the image with a caption that read, “Having a Bible just for a photo session not knowing that he’s reading upside down.” The same image was widely shared in WhatsApp platforms. The Star’s fact-check desk in its investigations established that Raila shared the original photo in his Twitter with a caption that read, “ It was heartening to exchange views on pertinent issues with Clergy drawn from all the 47 Counties at Ufungamano House, Nairobi County”. A further online search found out that the Daily Nation had used the photo on their online article dubbed, “Citing political struggles, Raila says he is a strong believer in God”. We looked at any other evidence available and in a YouTube video, Raila is seen holding the bible but in the right way. A further close examination at the altered image shows Raila with the bible written ‘Holy Bible’ in golden ink. In the original photo, the bible Raila is holding is written, ‘The Living Bible’ in red ink. On the altered image one can establish both writings are on it. This photo has also been debunked by PesaCheck. The Star concludes the photo is ALTERED.
