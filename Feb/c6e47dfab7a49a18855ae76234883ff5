A former KDF soldier has been arrested trying to defraud two unsuspecting victims in Machakos county. Washington Mutinda Mutuku was arrested with two forged calling letters for the ongoing KDF recruitment and Sh180,000. DCI George Kinoti said on Wednesday that Mutuku had masqueraded as a senior commander in the Kenya Defense Forces, and actively in the line of duty. Investigations have since been initiated to verify the authenticity of the calling letters, their source and other accomplices that may be involved in the malpractice. Kinoti cautioned members of the public to beware of tricksters who may be roaming around well armed with con tricks choreographed to swindle unsuspecting victims, especially in the ongoing KDF and oncoming NPS recruitment exercises. "Both giving and taking bribe are illegalities that will be met with the full force of the law,"DCI said. Last week, two people were arrested with over Sh500,000 trying to bribe KDF recruitment officers. Samuel Ongeri and Josphine Osebe were arrested at Borabu sub county. According to a police report, the two were arrested after they were found at security checks at Menyenye SDA primary ground within Nyamira county. Ongeri was found with Sh206,000 while Osebe was found with Sh 302,000.
