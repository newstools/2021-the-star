Kenya Electricity Generating Company has rolled out a revenue-generating programme for Kenya in Ethiopia, Djibouti, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. Energy Cabinet secretary Charles Keter on Saturday said Kenya had to break home protocol of confining business at home by extending revenue generation in neighboring countries that don’t have expertise in power generation. Keter said Kenya had borrowed a leaf from China that had been instrumental in Geothermal power generation away from her country in power generation that in recent years had earned her the much-needed foreign exchange earnings. “As a third world country we have learned that Kenya could also earn revenue by extending her electricity power generation programmes to our neighboring countries,” CS Keter said. Keter spoke at Imarisho Sacco Society Ltd in Kericho town after commissioning the Saccos new customer care experience centre at the Saccos KEBO plaza. Keter asked Sacco officials to consider expanding the business beyond Kenya if they expect to remain strong and benefit its members and non-members in the future. “With an investment of Sh14 billion, Keter said the Sacco was going places with such huge investment since not many Sacco that we know of have such amount of investment,” Keter said. So far the Sacco has branches in neighbouring Nandi, Bomet, Narok, Nakuru and Nairobi and according to the chairman more branches are going to be opened. It has a diaspora branch in the USA  and plans to open another one in the United Kingdom (UK).
