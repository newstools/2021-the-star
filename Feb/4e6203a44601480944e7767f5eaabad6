A judge has ordered two people implicated in the NYS scandal to forfeit Sh97 million to the state. Anti-Corruption court judge Mumbi Ngugi ordered Charity Wangui Gethi and Samwel Mdanyi Wachenje to hand over the money which is held in different accounts to the state. Granting the order for forfeiture the judge said, "In the present case I have found that the agency has established on a balance of probabilities that Sh87, 000,000 in the 1st respondent’s account (Charity) and Sh10, 000,000 in 2nd respondents account (Wachenje) was part of funds fraudulently transferred from NYS and into Josephine Kabura Irungu’s entities’ accounts.” The judge noted that Charity proffered an explanation that does not satisfy the court that the agency’s contentions are wrong. Her contention that the Sh15 million that she redeemed from Old mutual to her standard chartered bank account on August 26, 2015 was subject to case is not borne out by evidence or judgment in that case, noted justice Ngugi. Justice Ngugi’s decision arose out of an application filed by an asset recovery agency claiming that the money in question was stolen from the National youth service. According to the agency Wachenje is beneficiary of Sh10 million held at Family bank Kagwe branch which is allegedly part of the Sh791 million stolen from NYS. Charity is said to have been the beneficiary of Sh87 million.
