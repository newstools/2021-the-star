American singer Stevie Wonder is planning to permanently move to Ghana. The Grammy award-winning star said this in an Interview with Oprah Winfrey, explaining his reason to be political turmoil in America. “I promise you, if you do the right thing, I will give you this song. I will give it to you. You can have it, because I wanna see this nation smile again. And I want to see it before I leave to travel to move to Ghana, because I’m going to do that," he said. Adding, “I don’t want to see my children’s, children’s children have to say ‘Oh, please like me, please respect me, please know that I am important, please value me’." Wonder is a legend known for songs like 'You are the sunshine of my life' and 'I just called to say I love you'. He is a 25-time Grammy Award winner and UN Messenger of Peace.
