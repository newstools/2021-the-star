Kenya Commercial Bank coach Zedekiah Otieno Zico is eyeing the Betway Cup trophy this season. Speaking after his side saw off Division Two side Kiendege Jets in Nyamira to qualify to the round of 32 of the tournament, Zico said his main target this season is to lift the domestic cup. “Our target is to win this tournament so that we can represent Kenya at continental level next season,” Zico said.  He said the team will also pay special attention to the Kenya Premier League. He admitted that the Division Two side gave them hard time but petitioned the Football Kenya Federation to ensure matches are played at standard fields. “This field is bumpy and is likely to cause injuries. This is  low for a tournament of this magnitude. However, I’m happy that we won and entertained fans who have never seen a KPL team play here,” said the tactician. Kiendege Jets chief executive officer Davies Mokaya said his players suffered stage flight and wasted several scoring opportunities. “The players have never played against a KPL team. They took time to settle but  , I’m happy with their performance,” said Mokaya. During the match, Simon Munala, Micheal Mutinda and Samuel Mwangi scored for the KPL side while second half substitute Dennis Toeri scored Kiedege Jets’ solitary goal. In other matches, Fortune Sacco prevailed to the next round after a 4-2 penalty shootout win over FC Shells.
