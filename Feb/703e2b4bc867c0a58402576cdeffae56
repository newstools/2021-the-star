The Kenya Basketball Federation league will start on February 13, according to fixtures secretary, Joseph Amoko. Top teams led by national women’s champions Equity Bank and Kenya Ports Authority were last weekend involved in a pre-season tournament ahead of the new season. KPA sent an early warning to Equity by winning the pre-season tournament staged at Strathmore University courts. The KPA team, led by Linda Ocholla and Carol Akinyi, pipped their ‘B’ team anchored by internationals Hilda Indasi and Natalie Akinyi 40-38 to carry the day. The porters also beat Equity Bank, who paraded Better Kananu, Cynthia Maweu, Melissa Akinyi and Belinda Okoth. Amoko said they have a team managers meeting this weekend to deliberate on some pertinent issues and discuss the league rules before tip off. He also warned  teams that have not cleared their league fees to do so as soon as possible or risk being locked out. “Things will be different this time round,” he warned. “2021 league will be very strict and we will not allow any team to participate without fully meeting their financial obligations.” He directed that all players taking part in the league must have their playing cards otherwise they will not be allowed onto the court On transfers, he said no players will be allowed to clear with their old clubs before being issued a card. “Clearance from the treasurer and issuance of new players card will be mandatory. We will be very strict this time round.”
