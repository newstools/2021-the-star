A Sierra Leone national is being held at the Industrial Area Prison after he was arrested for conning a Kenyan woman. Alfred Mumoh Bangura was nabbed by DCI detectives after Joyce Mbalo made distress calls that she had lost her valuables to him. "A lady in Ruaka is counting her losses after what began as a chat at a popular dating site, ended up in tears after she was robbed off her phone worth Sh25,000 and other valuables," the DCI said. According to the DCI, Joyce met her would-be lover  Bangura on Badoo dating site and after a few days of chats, they decided to meet up physically and get to know each other. They later met at a petrol station in Marurui and together, drove towards Kahawa West in the suspect’s vehicle. However, along the way the suspect turned against her and robbed her off her valuables, leaving her in distress. "Detectives immediately went on his trail and arrested him yesterday. He was found to be a foreigner from Sierra Leone, and did not have proper documentation," the DCI said. Today morning, he was arraigned in court and is currently remanded at the Industrial Area Prison
