Gospel artist Kambua Mathu is mourning the death of her newborn baby boy who passed on days after being born. The artist shared the news through her official Instagram account on Monday evening that her son Malachi Manundu Muthiga Mathu died. She wrote that “My little baby boy Malachi made a grand entrance into the world a few days ago. He was everything we hoped for, and more, much more. Perfect in every way. Malachi knew how much he was loved, and so he did all he could stay with us.” She added that "With the help of a most dedicated team of doctors, and nurses, our little baby fought until Jesus healed him by taking him to Himself. Malachi is now free from pain and worldly care." The artist said that "Our tears fall freely because our hearts are broken beyond words. But our faith and hope remain unshaken because we have trust in a dependable God. A good good Father." Malachi was Kambua's and her husband Jackson Mathu's second born. The artist has asked Kenyans to allow the couple time to grieve.
