Clerics want Nacada and security agencies in Meru to intensify the fight against drug trafficking and abuse. The clerics, under the Umbrella of the National Council of Churches of Kenya-Upper Eastern, said illicit brews and drugs are sold in the open just like mandazi. NCCK-Upper Eastern chairman Jediel Kaigongi said many young people in the region are turning to zombies due to drug and substance abuse. He spoke on Tuesday at Gitoro Conference Centre during a regional committee meeting. Participants were from Meru, Isiolo, Marsabit and Tharaka Nithi. “The regional committee has noted with concern the rising rate of drug trafficking and abuse in our counties. The trade and abuse of drugs is being done openly,” Kaigongi said. He urged Nacada to partner with the church in sensitising young people on the effects of drug abuse and rehabilitating addicts. Two weeks ago, Nacada Eastern regional coordinator Alex Njeru said they were conducting a baseline survey on alcohol and drug use in the county. “We thank the Meru Governor [Kiraitu Murungi] because it is the only county in the region where we have worked jointly to accredit rehabilitation centres and  launch a support group for victims of drug and substance abuse,” Njeru said. Meru County Alcoholic and Drinks Control Board CEO Mwaki Arimi told the Star the partnership will cater to 40 victims of drug and substance abuse. “It will be free of charge and will be facilitated by the authority through NHIF,” Mwaki said. The committee also said locust invasions have worsened food insecurity in the counties. The pest has destroyed large swathes of agricultural land and pastures. “The low yield of farmlands and devastation by locusts have led to an increase in the high cost of food and farm input,” Kaigongi said. "The committee calls upon the ministry of Agriculture to increase efforts to control locust invasions. We encourage citizens to embrace climate-smart agriculture to ensure food security at household level."
