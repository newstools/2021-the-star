There is an element in our schools that’s of critical importance than the curriculum: A well-educated teacher of the English language. In any education system, the teacher is the nerve centre of any successful curriculum implementation. With the new CBC in its early stages and the gradual curriculum transition, learners need teachers well versed in the English language. Following the release of the Knec National Learning Assessment report, the blame quickly shifted to loss of learning during the long Covid-19 schools closure. Another false diagnosis was that the online learning conducted through KICD had little impact. In the report, English is the major casualty, with almost half of the Grade 4 and Std 8 pupils failing to get the 50 per cent pass mark. English is the instructional language for all subjects except Kiswahili. The understanding of concepts and general performance on any other subject squarely depends on a learner’s grasp of the language. There’s simply no way a Std 8 child would forget how to read and answer simple maths questions within nine months of school closure. This raises questions on the kind of foundation they received in their early school years. Reading has been proven to help in developing comprehension and analytical skills. Without a good teacher, we might end up training, not educating, a generation of children. We are starving our children of reading materials. Schools do not have functional libraries. The major book of knowledge is the textbook! For learners to excel in all subjects, they must first excel in English. This means they must be taught, in their early years, by teachers who are well versed in the language. The onus is now on the Teachers Service Commission. The TSC must get competent teachers.
