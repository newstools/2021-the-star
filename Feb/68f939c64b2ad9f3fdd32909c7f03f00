Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled. The decision could mean thousands of Uber drivers are set to be entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. The ruling could leave the ride-hailing app facing a hefty compensation bill, and have wider consequences for the gig economy. Uber said the ruling centred on a small number of drivers and it had since made changes to its business. In a long-running legal battle, Uber had appealed to the Supreme Court after losing three earlier rounds. Uber's share price fell 1 per cent on Wall Street's open as investors grappled with what impact the London ruling could have on the firm's business model. It is being challenged by its drivers in multiple countries over whether they should be classed as workers or self-employed.
