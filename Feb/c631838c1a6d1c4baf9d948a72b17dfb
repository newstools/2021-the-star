The Institute of Economic Affairs(IEA) has termed the proposed changes in packaging of alcoholic drinks as a clear case of a wrong policy by the government. “The proposal to limit alcohol manufacturing, packaging and distribution to 750ml will only cause huge adjustment costs on the supply side and not the demand side where the proposer asserts that problem of excessive drinking exists,” said economists at IEA. Wundanyi MP Danson Mwakuwona who proposed the bill says its main objective is to deal with the problem of excessive drinking occasioned by the sale of very low quantities of alcoholic drinks making it accessible to the youth. In a memo sent to the National Assembly clerk, IEA notes that the policy will have manufacturers and packagers pay for the costs of the changes in packaging quantities because of their new obligation as suppliers but will not shift demand. The economists also argue that there is no evidence that confirms that packaging at the 750 ml limit for alcohol will deter youthful consumers. ICEA says the net effect of the regulation will create distortions on the supply side and lead to shrinkage of the share of formal alcohol market. Research conducted by the firm shows that Kenya has a two-sided supply for the alcoholic beverages market. The implication of this is that when alcohol traded in the formal market by registered firms is unaffordable or unavailable, then the informal market is a ready substitute that consumers with a lower income will have access to. The shift or substitution effects from the formal side to informal side will see the government be unable to regulate sale, manufacturing, distribution and standards informal side and forgo revenue formal side. The Kenya Association of Manufacturers is also opposed to the proposed law noting that it will result in massive job losses across the alcohol value chain, from glass and carton manufacturers, bars and transporters to distributors.
