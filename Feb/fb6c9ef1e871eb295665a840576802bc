Newcastle vs Southampton, Saturday 6pm Newcastle United remain in relegation trouble after returning just one win in 11 Premier League matches. The hosts have started this calendar year with three PL home defeats, something they hadn’t done previously since 2014. They ended that particular run with a 1-0 home win — the same score-line by which the ‘Magpies’ beat Southampton in their last victory against them 11 months ago. After a midweek Mancunian massacre, mid-table Southampton have now been on the losing end in two of the PL’s three historical 9-0 score-lines. In addition to drawing a blank in six of their last nine league matches, Southampton have also failed to win any of their previous four matches at St. James’ Park. Southampton are no strangers to a PL thrashing, and the club’s all-time league record after a PL loss by a 5+ goal margin, with seven wins across the last nine therein. Five of those seven wins came with a clean sheet.  Head to head 06.11.20 PL Southampton Newcastle 2 : 0 07.03.20 PL Southampton Newcastle 0 : 1 08.12.19 PL Newcastle Southampton 2 : 1 20.04.19 PL Newcastle Southampton 3 : 1 27.10.18 PL Southampton Newcastle 0 : 0 Sheffield United vs Chelsea, Sunday 10:15pm After coming from behind to beat West Bromwich, the ‘Blades’ have curiously seen each of their decisive PL match winners this term arrive between the 70th and 75th minutes of play. Late drama has also worked against them on multiple occasions though, with Chris Wilder’s men conceding an average of 0.71 goals per-game between the 61st minute and FT across their PL defeats this term. The reverse fixture saw them concede twice in that same period. Chelsea’s title hopes still seem far more distant than they were just two months ago despite two undefeated games under new coach Thomas Tuchel. Yet, the Blues’ status as pre-match favourites makes it worth noting that they averaged a very consistent 1.75 goals per game beyond the hour mark across their eight PL victories attained. With the opposition still projected for a basement finish, Chelsea fans should know that the ‘Blues’ have a 100 per cent away league record against eventual bottom clubs over the preceding seven seasons. Across those wins, Chelsea averaged 2.57 goals per match and a margin of 2.14, with clean sheets.

The ‘Biancocelesti’ have been a predictable team during this streak, scoring beyond the hour mark in all five wins, whilst netting the opener four times. The hosts have also won four straight SA home matches, helping them heal the wounds of a terrible start to the season here. Yet despite netting in 11 of their 16 home league goals at the Stadio Olimpico after the break, Lazio are yet to win a home match when trailing at HT- although they did just that in two of the last three H2Hs at all venues. As for Cagliari, their 1-1 draw last time out snapped a seven-game losing streak, but the Sardinian side remain winless in 13 matches despite nine witnessing both teams score. In addition to poor away league form this season, Cagliari have lost nine consecutive H2Hs here, conceding over 2.5 goals in four of the last five.
