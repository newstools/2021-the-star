After a six-year hiatus, Kenya Forest Service team are back in the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) League. The team, coached by Wachira Gathweria,  was disbanded in 2014, owing to financial constraints. A change in Kenya Forest Service management necessitated the team's comeback and Gathweria insists they are in good shape despite winning only one of three matches during the first leg played in Mombasa. KFS lost to both Kenya Defence Forces and Kenya Ports Authority KPA by a similar 3-1 set margin. They, however,  beat Mombasa Prison by the same scoreline. "We managed one win and the victory was deserving. With the current blend of youth and experience, we are well placed to compete in this tough league. Booking a playoff slot  would be a big bonus to the team. Remember it's not the first time we are playing at the highest level. We have finished in third place before," he said. KFS have been dealt a blow with star centre player Stephen Muremi expected to be out  for unspecified period after undergoing a knee surgery. The tactician, however,  expects left attacker Bilasio Kokonya to be back in contention for the next round of fixtures after missing the Mombasa trip due to personal reasons. He also tipped the young players to show their grit and develop to become better players. "Muremi is a big miss to the team. Kokanya has played for the national team for a long time when he was with Kenya Prisons and he's the kind of player we definitely need to lift the mood of the team. Youngster Michael Wanyoike among others have  also proved decisive and there's more to come from them," he said.
