A Nairobi court on Thursday issued a warrant of arrest for a police officer who is a witness in case where former Tetu MP Ndungu Gethenji and six others are charged with creating disturbance. Gethenji is charged alongside Chacha Mabanga, Franklin Mutegi, Josiah Otimo, Godfrey Okello, Ochieng’ and Ouma Ogonji with creating disturbance at Kihingo Village, Kitusuru, in July 2019. They allegedly interfered with and stopped the renovation of a house belonging to Kumar Dhanji. Prosecution counsel Anthony Gikunda told Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku that DCI officer Evans Murira has severally failed to appear in court to testify. "Your honour, I would wish for a warrant of arrest against the officer through OCS Milimani. Murira is now attached to DCIO Londiani and has failed to come after summoning him three times," Gikunda told court. He said Murira was an officer attached to the Flying Squad and was the arresting officer in the case. Meanwhile, an investigating officer in the case told the court he found that the accused persons had committed the offence of creating disturbance. Constable Nicholas Njenga, formerly from Fying Squad in Nairobi, testified that on July 2, 2019 he was in office with colleagues when he was instructed by Inspector Musyoka to board a vehicle to Kihingo Village. Njenga said it was a distress call from Prof George Wajackoyah asking the officer to visit Kihingo as some suspects were creating a disturbance. Njenga testified that he proceeded and upon arrival at Kihingo he saw Gethenji and other suspects in a car and arrested them. “They explained to me how they were in the house that was being renovated when they saw the suspects come and chase the person who was doing the house repair,” Njenga told the court. Dhanji sought assistance as he was injured and his sweater was torn. “We recorded the statements and arrested the accused persons. The pullover is an exhibit in court,” the officer said.
