Some 458 girls did not report back to primary and secondary schools in Kajiado county due to pregnancies. Of that number, 234 are in secondary schools, while 224 are from primary schools across the five subcounties. County Education director Luka Kangogo made the disclosure on pregnancies on Tuesday in Loitokitok while addressing Education CS George Magoha. She said the number was the highest recorded. Magoha was touring the town with Water CS Sicily Kariuki. Kangogo said the students were forced to remain at home because of their condition. “Some were only days and weeks from giving birth and we thought it best to let them stay home and have their children before they are allowed back to school,” Kangogo said. Kangogo spoke at Loitokitok DEB Primary School. He said his office is monitoring all pregnant students so they can be reinstated as soon as possible. He said while he has struggled to ensure that all Covid-19 protocols are adhered to, many schools have no water for washing hands. “There is a big problem of water in this county. Schools in towns and rural areas are short of water," Kangogo said. Kariuki and Magoha later toured Nol-Turesh Water Company in Ntarara area of Loitokitok to inspect the construction and installation of solar panels for a water pump. The project is funded by donors and President Uhuru Kenyatta is to commission it in March. Residents of Loitokitok, who are drinking water from Tanzania, will be given priority.  (Edited by V.
