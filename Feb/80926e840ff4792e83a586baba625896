Deputy President William Ruto has said the 2022 presidential race will be development track records of the contestants. Ruto said that in the previous elections, leaders have banked on tribal groupings as a means to ascending to power. Speaking in reference to what is seen to target the coalition being championed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, the DP said taking back the country to tribal politics is backward. "The days' leaders relied on tribal politics to survive are now gone. Let those interested in leadership sell their agenda to Kenyans and stop regrouping along tribal lines," Ruto said. The DP toured Endebes, Trans Nzoia County on Saturday. On Thursday, the president paraded ODM leader Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Gideon Moi (Kanu), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya), and Charity Ngilu (NARC) at State House, Nairobi where they issued a joint statement on BBI. The "Deep State " is reported to be drawing a strong lineup to face off with Ruto who has put up a spirited campaign to succeed Uhuru in 2022. Mudavadi, Gideon, Kalonzo, and Wetangula have teamed up isolating Raila in the State House race. Ruto who is on a day's tour of the North Rift county said Kenyans are now enlightened and cannot be misled by leaders who are out to persevere power for their own interests. "Hustler movement is about economic empowerment with a bottom-up model which targets to empower the majority of Kenyans unlike now where few people eat the cake baked by Kenyans," he said.
