The last three weeks, Kiss FM has been spreading love through their campaign 'Love In The Air'. Being the month of love, the team has visited different homes and given back to the society. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, events and brand manager Kendi Kamotho said the love language experienced with listeners varies from week to week. "Week one, we had some quality time with our listeners. They'd call in and we'd give them quality time with their partners," she said. "Week two, we did dinner with the people the listeners nominated. This week, we thought why not do acts of service? We've gone to two homes, Mji Wa Huruma and Acorn, to spread our love." Acorn is a home that caters for children with disabilities, located in Dagoretti. Mji wa Huruma, on the other hand, is a home for the aged located in Runda. Apart from Kiss FM being one of the top radio stations, Kendi said, they are doing this to give gratitude to fans for making them number one. "We love our listeners and this is also to say thank you to them because we care," she said. "We are just giving and doing acts of service for people because everything is about love and how we show love as Kiss is to give." She added that Kisses of Kindness is here to stay. "Kiss on the Road is to spread kindness, fun, love, good memoires and experiences." Kiss FM presenters Kamene and Jalas have been on the ground to interact and donate to the needy. "We are here to spread some love," Jalang'o said in one of the visits to the homes.
