ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has accused 'outsiders' of dividing leaders in  Western to weaken the region politically. He said once political bigwigs from outside the region divide the leaders, they walk away claiming Western is not united. Without naming anyone, Mudavadi said the 'outsiders' are doing this so that the region can have various presidential candidates on the ballot and deny it a chance of winning the country's top seat. “If you look carefully, you will realise they are fronting only one candidate for the top seat in their regions." “When we are politically weak, we can’t fight for our region, we can’t negotiate and we can't push our agenda.” Mudavadi was addressing the Luhya elders at his home in Mululu village, Sabatia subcounty, where they had converged to deliberate on the region's ailing economy. The ANC boss said leaders in the region should speak in one voice to deliver residents from poverty. “Currently we are doing poorly economically. Mumias is down, Pan Paper is down, cotton millers in Busia are down and we can’t create employment for our youth.” he added. “It’s time that we make a move to rescue our region from this mess.” Mudavadi urged elders to reach out to other contestants within the region and ask them to drop their bids and support him. “Doubting Thomas will keep on saying he can’t make it, while Judas will keep on stabbing  you with a knife in the back whenever you try to make a move,” he said. “Moses Wetang’ula [of Ford Kenya]and I have decided to walk together to ensure we form the next government.” Mudavadi said the joint campaigns they are holding with Wetang'ula in Kabuchai and Matungu ahead of the March 4 MPs by-elections should serve as an indicator to the people of Western that they have decided to unite. His call comes after Mukhisa Kituyi declared his bid to run for the presidency in the next year's general election.
