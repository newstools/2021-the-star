Zimbabwe’s Robson Chinhoi soared to the top after a brilliant round of six under par 66 which gave him a three rounds total of 12 under par 201, going into today’s final round of the Safari Tour ninth leg at Karen. Playing alongside Kenya’s Dismas Indiza and Nigeria’s Andrew Odoh, Chinhoi made a bogey at the third hole, the only for the day, then posted four straight birdies to carry to the back nine a three under par. He birdied the 10th, where he drove to about 50 yard to the green, chipped on well and made an easy birdie. This was followed by another birdie at the 11th and 15th hole for three under and the day’s six under par. “I had some fabulous shots today and I am very happy my game plan for the Magical Kenya Open in very much in place,” said Chinhoi. The Zim is now operating on the same wave length with Indiza and Thika Sports Club’s Simon Ngige, who shot an impressive five under par 66 to move to third place on seven under par 206. On the other hand, Indiza who had started the day a shot behind Chinhoi and Nigeria’s Andrew Odoh, had a smooth front nine where he picked up a birdie at the first hole, and made it four under after picking up more birdies at the sixth, eighth and ninth. He drove onto the green at the 10th, missed a two by a foot for an easy birdie which put him on 10 under par same with Chinhoi who had also birdied the hole. Indiza remained on course, playing rather a conservative game though at the 18th. He blocked to the right trees, overshot the green and had to chip back. He missed a footer for a par to drop his only shot of  the day. “Today I wanted to take shot after shot and was able to make several birdies with the only bad second shot at the last hole being the only draw-back, but not to worry. There is another round tomorrow and who knows what can happen,” said the long hitter Indiza. “The greens are still slow but I am sure they will continue working on them but the course at the moment is playing well,” added Indiza whose nine under par total of 204 left him three shots behind the leader.
