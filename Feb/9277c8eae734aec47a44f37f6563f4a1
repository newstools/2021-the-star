Kenya is set to receive the first batch of Covid-19 vaccines next week. According to a dispatch from the Cabinet, the batch of the vaccines are expected to arrive in Kenya in the first week of March 2021. This development comes amid reports that the vaccines would be available to Kenyans after 2022. Last week it was reported that Kenya is among countries set to receive Covid-19 vaccines before end of February. In a statement by COVAX, Kenya is listed among the countries that will get the recommended vaccines as per the WHO Emergency Use Listing Procedure. Kenya will receive 4,176,000 doses as Uganda receives 3,552,000 doses of the vaccines in the region, while Rwanda will receive 996,000 doses. COVAX said it currently anticipates 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be available to the COVAX Facility in Q1 2021, subject to the completion of additional agreements. It will also be complemented by the larger volumes of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine available to the facility during the same time period. Additional volumes of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be available in the second quarter and beyond, per the signed advance purchase agreement between Gavi and Pfizer-BioNTech for up to 40 million doses. An exceptional process of distribution was undertaken to ensure maximum public health benefit from the smaller volume of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine anticipated to be available for Q1 delivery. In that regard, the Cabinet ratified the distribution framework for the vaccines with first priority being given to Health Care Workers, Frontline Workers including Security Personnel and Teachers, vulnerable persons and groups and Hospitality Sector Workers. As part of the nation’s response to the Coronavirus Pandemic, the Cabinet sanctioned heighten surveillance at all of Kenya’s international borders, so as to stem the propagation of the disease into the country.
