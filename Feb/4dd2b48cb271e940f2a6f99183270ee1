Police in Narok South subcounty have launched investigations to establish circumstances surrounding the torching of Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi’s official vehicle by irate mob on Wednesday evening. Area acting subcounty police commander Magdalene Chebet said members of the public got furious when the Toyota Prado hit a motorbike and killed a middle-aged man and his eight-year-old son on the spot. “Upon causing the accident, the deputy governor who was traveling in his official vehicle stopped to access the impact of the accident. However, a furious crowd consisting of men working in a nearby quarry and boda boda operators already started flocking the scene of the accident and started threatening the deputy governor,” Chebet said. The 7pm accident occurred at Tekero area, about three kilometres from Ololulunga trading centre along the busy Narok-Bomet road. The governor's vehicle was traveling from Kisii to Nairobi. The police officer said the accident happened when the motorbike was entering the main road from a feeder road and was hit by the speeding vehicle. “The situation forced the deputy governor, driver and bodyguard to board another vehicle and escaped towards Narok town leaving the engine of their vehicle still running." The irate mob after missing the deputy governor started hitting the vehicle with stones and set it on fire. “It is very unfortunate that we lost the two people in the accident that occurred last evening. The deputy governor’s vehicle must have been speeding at the time of the accident,” Chebet said. She said she had spoken to the governor’s bodyguard over the phone and confirmed that the three escaped unhurt in the accident. “We expect the driver of the deputy governor to come to our office to record a statement that will facilitate the investigations,” she said.
