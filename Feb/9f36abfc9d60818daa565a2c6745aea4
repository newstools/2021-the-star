The question of Raila Odinga's options in 2022 has been brought about by the altercation between him and the other Nasa principals. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka have been attacking Raila simply because he said he will not endorse them for president in 2022. But these issues have been adequately addressed by our party chairman John Mbadi in his statement to newsrooms. The chairman has explained it clearly as well the allegations that our party leader is not trustworthy. From the statement, we can see that it is Mudavadi and Kalonzo who are not trustworthy and not Raila as they are trying to convince Kenyans to believe. On the issue of the [mock] swearing-in that took place on January 30, 2018, they – Kalonzo and Mudavadi – have given more than three contradictory reasons or statements on why they did not turn up. That was the height of untrustworthiness. You cannot agree as gentlemen then some of you back down. That is not being a gentleman. So, Raila’s options and his chances of winning the presidency in the 2022 general election are a different subject. Winning the presidency requires alliances. You cannot win the presidency single-handedly, and that has been proved by experience. We have been in an alliance with Kalonzo, Mudavadi, Moses Wetang'ula and other leaders for the last two elections – Cord for 2013 and Nasa for the 2017 elections. Both alliances have not worked. They did not deliver us to Canaan where we intended to reach. So, we are going back to the drawing board. We are crafting new alliances and making new friendships to ensure that we realise our dream of transforming this country. We are looking for new partners. And we believe that we will get new partners who will propel us to the presidency in 2022. There are several people that we can partner with. The election is more than a year away and as they say, a day is a very long time in politics. We are working on a formidable alliance. The Alego Usonga MP spoke to the Star
