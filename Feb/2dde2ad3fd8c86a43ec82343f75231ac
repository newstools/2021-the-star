A legislator from Kiambu county has urged parents to pull up their socks and clear fee balances to avoid stressing school managements. Lari MP Jonah Mburu on Monday lamented that some have never paid anything, yet some services like the feeding programme are funded by parents. He said secondary schools are worst affected, with head teachers fearing to send students home for fear of disobeying a directive by the government. "Some schools have had to borrow funds as they cannot discontinue feeding their students and at the same time they know the impact of hunger on students during afternoon classes," he said. "We are urging them not borrow too much, and we are hereby asking parents to pay and clear school fees." He was speaking at Gitithia Girls in his constituency during a parents' meeting. Mburu was accompanied by his CDF and bursary committees. They assured to assist needy parents who are making some efforts but cannot clear their balances. Education CS George Magoha last month asked head teachers not to send students home for fees, as some are still affected by the impact of Covid-19. In view of this, Joseph Muturi, a member of the school board, said no student has been sent home to collect fees or any other money this year. At the same time, Mburu urged students to work hard towards passing their exams. He also appealed to sector players and well-wishers to support teachers and students to raise their KCSE mean score, as the old syllabus gets phased out. He also urged learners to maintain the good morals they have been taught at home, school and church, so they can lead a good life in society after school.
