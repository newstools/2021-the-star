The six Coast governors on Wednesday will meet in Taita Tavets to discuss revamping their economic bloc and pushing for development. “My friends agree we must leave landmark projects when our time to leave the political arena shall come. The region’s economic growth will be determined by our unity and teamwork,” Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja said on Monday. The other governors meeting areSalim Mvurya (Kwale), Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Amason Kingi (Kilifi), Dhadho Godhana (Tana River) and Fahim Twaha of Lamu. They will meet at Samboja's Mwakishimba home in Wundanyi subcounty. The meeting comes as some political leaders in the region are pushing for formation of a regional political party, breaking away from ODM for which people traditionally have voted. Joho is an ODM deputy party leader. The governors also are likely to discuss a Coast party, the Star was told. Samboja on Monday said revamping the region's economic bloc was on the agenda. “The time has come when we need to think of developing the region without necessarily depending on the national government,” he said. He said the governors are keen to ensure the Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP) roadmap on development is attained. The push for a common party is also facing a stumbling block as  Joho and Kingi have so far failed to agree on whether the region should discard Twaha and Mvurya who are close allies of Deputy President William Ruto have been silent of the formation of a Coast party. Samboja said the meeting will help cool persistent hostilities among factions at the Coast He said development  can only be attained if peace prevails in all the six counties. “My friends agree we must leave landmark projects when our time to leave the political arena shall come. The region’s economic growth will be determined by our unity and teamwork,” Samboja said. He said the governors will further strategise on how to rally the region to support BBI.
