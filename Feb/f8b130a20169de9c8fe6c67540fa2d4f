The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority has commenced the distribution of re-usable face masks to needy school going children in primary and secondary schools. Mwiki Primary School in Nairobi County was the first beneficiary. The school is one of the learning institutions with the highest student population in the country. It received 4,320 pieces of face masks to cater for the 3,991 children enrolled in the institution. Kemsa acting CEO Edward Njoroge said 637,407 face masks will be distributed to schools in Nairobi and its environs this month. This is due to the high prevalence of Covid-19 reported within the region. Nairobi County will receive 34,641 masks for children below six years, 57,723 for those aged between 6-12 years and 48,648 for 13 years and above. Murang’a County will get 39,869 for children below 6 years, 43,980 for children aged between 6-12 years and 84,003 for 13 years and above. Kiambu County 90,600 for children below 6 years, 60,914 for 6-12 years and 96,469 for 13 years and above. Kajiado county, which is also within the Nairobi Metropolitan area, will receive 50,936 masks for children below 6 years, 6,670 for children aged between 6-12 years and 22,954 for 13 years and above. Njoroge said the Authority is working closely with Kenya National Chamber of Commerce to ensure timely distribution of the rest of the face masks to the targeted schools. “We have received a distribution plan from the Ministry of Health for the rest of the Counties and we will play our role of ensuring that the commodities are distributed promptly to the last mile based on stock availability,” he re-assured. The CEO stated that the Authority will be accountable in sharing information with the Ministry on the stock status as distribution progresses. “We remain to be the Logistics provider of choice fully committed to improve the quality of health care for all Kenyans, he stressed. While launching the distribution program, Education CS George Magoha said the distribution of reusable face masks will be done to learners in schools with high enrolment, schools in informal settlements and special schools. Magoha said the Education Ministry had promised to supply free washable face masks to schools nationwide to boost Covid-19 prevention. “The government is committed to providing quality and equitable education at the same time safeguarding every child's right to education, health and safety,” he reiterated. He was joined by Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi, among other senior officials from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education.. Mwiki Primary School Principal Joseph Kamau expressed his gratitude to Ministry of Education and Kemsa through the MoH for the positive gesture of selecting the school to run the launch program. “Even as you launch the program countrywide, I feel privileged that you have chosen our school and I want to pray that KEMSA becomes greater to allow us have a working relationship even in the future,” Kamau said.
