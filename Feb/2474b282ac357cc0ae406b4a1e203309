A four-day search for a missing taxi driver in Naivasha ended on a sour note after his badly mutilated body was found dumped near Gilgil town. The body of Isaac Thumbi Njuguna was found in a thicket two kilometres from the town. His car, which he recently acquired and had been using around Naivasha town, is still missing. His body was partially eaten by wild animals and had injuries inflicted with blunt objects. Njuguna went missing on Tuesday last week after he was hired by unknown people to ferry them to Gilgil. Gilgil OCPD John Ondit said police were informed by the public about a body that  was lying off the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. He said they recovered some identification documents and traced his home area in Naivasha. “Our counterparts from Naivasha have taken over the case and we suspect that the deceased was murdered elsewhere before the body was dumped in Gilgil,” he said. Meanwhile, two people died and four others were seriously injured following an accident involving a van along the Moi North Lake road in Naivasha. The two men were confirmed dead on arrival at Naivasha sub-county hospital where they were rushed following the early morning incident near Great Rift Valley Lodge. The private van was ferrying the passengers from Kasarani estate in North Lake to Naivasha town on Sunday morning when the driver lost control and the vehicle rolled several times. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the driver of the ill-fated car was among those who were seriously injured. He said the driver was in high speed when he tried to manoeuvre a corner on the road. “This was a self-involving accident where the driver of the van lost control leading to the death of two people while four others are admitted in hospital in serious condition,” he said.
