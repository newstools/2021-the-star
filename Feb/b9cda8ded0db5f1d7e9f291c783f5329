The Environment CS Keriako Tobiko has said there is a need to tap more resources to mitigate climate change effects. Tobiko said that resources should be from bilateral, multi-lateral engagements, and UNFCCC climate finance mechanisms. He made his remarks on Wednesday during the virtual meeting which was graced by the Treasury PS Julius Muia among others. “Resource mobilization for climate should be guided by or priority as a country to focus on reducing vulnerabilities and emphasis on resilience building and addressing drought which is the main climate-related risk,” Tobiko said. Tobiko called for concerted efforts to address concerns of climate change even as the country grapples with building back better in post-Covid- 19 recovery phases. The CS said mobilization of external resources was critical even as internal resources mobilization mechanisms are strengthened. During the meeting, Tobiko applauded the establishment of the Climate Finance and Green Growth Unit at the Ministry of Finance and Planning, saying that it was a step in the right direction taking cognisance of finance as a key enabler in climate action. He added that their role as the National Designated Authority for Green Climate Fund and Adaptation Fund was critical in accelerating climate finance flow into the country. The CS called for leveraging resources from the private through innovative avenues like green bond and carbon trading. The CS said the impacts of adverse weather have severely compromised on the country's aspirations as envisaged in the Constitution, the Vision 2030, the Big Four Agenda as well as the gains so far made.
