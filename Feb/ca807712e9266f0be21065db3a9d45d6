An assault case against former Tetu MP Ndung'u Gethenji has been deferred after his lawyer told the court that he is sick. Gethinji who allegedly assaulted a Kihingo Village security guard on February 5 was to plead to the charges on Tuesday before a Milimani Law court. "Your honour I will be seeking an adjournment since I learned this morning that my client is sick and in a hospital bed," Lawyer Ishmael Nyaribo told the court on Tuesday. George Wajackoyah who is representing the victim, Godfrey Mutua, told the court that he has an application in court which will be addressed before Gethinji's other lawyer Willis Otieno. Milimani Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku deferred his plea to March 24. She also ordered that Gethinji's lawyer produce medical documents in court before taking plea. Reportedly, at 11.28 pm on February 5, Gethenji arrived at the gate of Kihingo Village where he lives and where he has been in a protracted dispute with the other residents. As a result, he has been removed from the chairmanship of Kihingo Village Management Company and no longer plays any part in the management of the upmarket estate in Kitisuru. Gethenji was annoyed that Securex was recently appointed to provide security to Kihingo Village and that his preferred security company 911 was blocked from entering the estate. On that night, a Kihingo guard, Mutua asked the driver to lower the windows of Ndungu's vehicle so that he could check that they were not surreptitiously smuggling in any 911 guards. An irate Ndung'u and his bodyguard then got out of the car. In the CCTV video of the gate, the former MP is clearly seen to hit and then kick the guard. The guard was taken to MP Shah Hospital where he was given three stitches to close the wound. The assault was reported to Gigiri Police Station.
