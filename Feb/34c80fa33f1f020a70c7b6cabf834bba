Kirinyaga Kanu leaders will sensitize citizens about the BBI report in all subcounties. County chair John Gathungu said they shall form small groups to enlighten wananchi about the report. Gathungu who gave out copies of the BBI report for distribution said his party supports the initiative because it shall play a key role in uniting leaders and Kenyans. They also rallied behind President Uhuru Kenyatta’s leadership for implementing transformative projects in the country as well as sigining a working pact with Kanu. “We are contented with President Kenyatta ‘s leadership. He has also urged us to support the BBI report because it will benefit us. We as Kirinyaga Kanu grassroots leaders have heeded his call as well as that of our party leader Gideon Moi. We are ready to help market the document because we want Kirinyaga to speak in one voice,” Gathungu said. He said they will not be marketing the report in churches but each leader will organise small groups in their areas to carry out their exercise. “We have resolved to keep the house of worship out of BBI politics. We will have our own groups," he said. He thanked the county assemblies for  showing confidence in the recommendations and overwhelmingly adopting the BBI report . Gathungu called on all elected leaders within the county to join hands to begin BBI sensitisation of the masses. He said that it would be unfortunate if the public rejected it as a result of ignorance. County party spokesperson Sammy Kanyuira said the BBI will bring about the desired development. He also applauded the healthy working relationship between the government and his party . “Our party has been at the forefront supporting the work that is being carried out by the government and we thank the two parties for the cordial relationship," he said.
