High Court Judge Anthony Mrima has bowed out from all matters touching on the leadership of Nairobi County Government. In a brief ruling, Mrima said he has opted to recuse himself from handling the cases which by now are well over 20 in number following a complaint filed against him before the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). “The filing of complaint per se does not preclude a court from dealing with the matter but there are instances where depending on the nature of the matter and in order to enhance public confidence in the administration of justice, a court may consider recusing itself. That is the position I opt for in this matter,” he said. The complaint before the JSC was filed by one Henry Shitanda. He accused Justice Mrima of being biased when he allowed the vetting process of Anne Kananu Mwenda to proceed. On Tuesday, Mrima said he will not handle any matter touching on the Governorship of Nairobi County. He directed the matters be placed before Justice Weldon Korir for further directions today. Mrima in his brief ruling said he acted in the best interest of Nairobi City County and the country at large when he allowed the vetting process to continue. He said the court had no option but to avoid a looming constitutional crisis. “In the absence of an acting governor, a governor or a deputy, many questions calling for answers arise. Some of these questions are how the county would run and issues of health department fighting the dreaded coronavirus among many other questions,” he said. He maintained that a court of law must uphold the Constitution and not create a constitutional crisis. “This court asserted its inherent jurisdiction in finding a way forward since the Constitution and the law is silent on what happens to a legal process for the nomination of a deputy governor which is in position by the time the governor leaves office,” he said.
