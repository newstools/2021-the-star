It is good news that Kenya Railways is reviving its moribund network. The Nairobi-Nanyuki train service is already operational and work is going on to revive the Nairobi-Malaba and the Nairobi-Kisumu lines. A good rail network takes off the pressure on our roads as it will shift a big chunk of passenger and cargo volumes from the roads, which have become death traps. Rail transport offers reasonable costs because of the benefit of volumes, a relief from the high charges by PSV operators and cargo hauliers. However, the manner in which the project is being executed leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Hundreds of property owners have seen their investments reduced to rabble as tractors reclaim what was once railway land. The colonial railway network took up huge tracks of land as it crossed from Mombasa to the hinterland. At the time, most of the land was unoccupied due to sparse populations. With the rapid growth in population, Kenya Railways should only keep what it needs, while the extra land should be sold to the public at the prevailing market rates. Demolishing structures built several metres away from the train truck defies logic. Commercial centres along the railway line are key for business since the trains are supposed to serve people and not wild animals. Kenya Railways must review its land policy and only bring down structures that pose an imminent risk to the operation of its trains.
