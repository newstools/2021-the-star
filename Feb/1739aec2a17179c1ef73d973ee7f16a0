Diamond Platnumz was in Nairobi over the weekend for just a few hours before he jetted back to Tanzania. The singer shared photos of himself at the airport with his son Naseeb Junior, which led to fans asking why he came to the country. It turns out he came for a private party in Runda, where he is rumoured to have been paid a six-figure check. The host of the blue-and-white themed event also sent a private jet to transport the singer. Diamond shared videos in the jet on social media. "Done with Nairobi. Back to my Momaâ€™s Land!" he wrote. The singer was received at the airport by a Bentley. In a recent interview, the 'Mbagala' hitmaker said he is paid between $50,000-70,000 (Sh5-7 million) to perform. A source tells Word Is the singer's management arrived in Kenya days before him.
