The National Commission and Integration Commission (NCIC) has condemned the utterance made by the Suna East MP Junet Mohammed towards the Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura. In a brief statement posted through its official Twitter account on Saturday, the commission said that it is considering taking action against Junet. It said that such utterances are demeaning to persons living with disabilities. On Saturday, while addressing the residents of Turkana in one of the forum attended by the ODM party leader Raila Odinga, Junet attacked Mwaura for siding with Deputy President William Ruto's camp. Junet used the words that have been condemned across social media by Kenyans who said that the MP was wrong to use the skin colour of Mwaura for his political interest. Raila is on a three-day tour to the county to mobilise residents to support the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) proposals. The commission said that such remarks may trigger division between persons of different colors. "The commission is considering the matter with the view of taking appropriate action," NCIC said. NCIC chairperson Samuel Kobia announced on Wednesday that the commission has developed two lists of shame and fame ahead of next year's elections to curb the spate of political violence. MPs Simba Arati (Dagorreti North), Silvanus Osoro (South Mugirango),Â Johanna Ng'eno (Emurua Dikir MP), and former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko were named in the list of shame. Njoro MP Charity Kathambi and her Fafi counterpart Abdikhaim Osman Mohamed were celebrated in the list of fame.
