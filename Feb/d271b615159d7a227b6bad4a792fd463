National carrier Kenya Airways on Monday announced the resumption of its cargo services to New Delhi. The first cargo flight to resume from New Delhi landed at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on Sunday, carrying pharmaceuticals, machinery and general merchandise from New Delhi. Kenya Airways Cargo Director Dick Murianki said the weekly service will also serve to support Kenya’s intra-African export market and provide a welcome lifeline to many local businesses reliant on overseas markets. Murianki  noted that KQ Cargo has rapidly scaled up its cargo services in an effort to address the growing need for air freight across the continent and will be connecting the ever-increasing number of international markets to help maintain and replenish essential supplies. “The resumption of direct weekly cargo flights from Nairobi to New Delhi, is an indication of the integral part KQ plays in providing logistics solutions to our customers based on our robust world class handling infrastructure and strong network footprint in Africa," he said in a press statement. Key items to be uplifted from India include pharmaceutical and medical products, machinery, sports goods and general cargo. The Cargo director added, "Cargo will continue to offer seamless connections in India to Nairobi, and the rest of Africa, including destinations such as Accra, Ghana; Lagos, Nigeria; and Lilongwe, Malawi".
