World governing football body, Fifa, has ordered Kenyan Premier League side AFC Leopards to pay their former midfielder Vincent Habamahoro Sh 1.7 million in outstanding dues and compensation for breach of contract. "The respondent (AFC Leopards) shall provide evidence of payment of the due amount to Fifa,” said the statement. “In the event, the amounts due plus interest are not paid within 45 days as from the notification of the claimant by the relevant details to the respondent, the respondent shall be banned from registering new players, either nationally or internationally up until the new amounts are paid and for the maximum duration of three entire and consecutive transfer windows,” the statement added. Habamahoro crossed over to Rwandan club Kiyovu Sports after terminating his contract with Leopards in December in the wake of a heated pay-dispute. He claimed he had gone for four months without pay. The 13-time KPL champions had previously experienced dire financial constraints that negated their quest for titles but they now appear to have found renewed vigour after landing a Sh20 million sponsorship deal with online betting firm, Betway early in the year. The situation led to unprecedented mass player exodus that saw the likes of John Makwatta, Whyvonne Isuza, Dennis Sikhayi, Moses Mburu, Brian Marita and coach Casa Mbungo ditch the club due to unpaid salaries. Ingwe are currently fourth on the log on 18 points from 8 matches and hope to scale higher heights if they outfox reigning champions Gor Mahia in the highly publicised 'Mashemeji Derby' at MISC, Kasarani on Sunday. This is the second time Fifa are making such demands on a Kenyan club  after previously ordering Gor Mahia to pay Tanzanian winger Dickson Ambundo Sh1.3 million for a breach of contract.
