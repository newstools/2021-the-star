Tanzanian gospel artiste Rose Muhando is set to launch her album in Kenya this month. In a recent interview on Churchill, Muhando said she is proud of Kenya and that is the reason she’s launching her album here. She added that everything, including her health, improved after she was hospitalised in Kenya. Muhando was hospitalised a few weeks after a video clip emerged online, showing her being exorcised of ‘demons’ by Pastor James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism Centre. "It is because of the support Kenyans gave me. I am the same person you people contributed and prayed for," she said. The entry fee of the album launch is Sh50,000 per person. While asked why she decided to charge that expensively, Muhando in a radio interview on Tuesday said she wants to use the money to build a church for God. "You know I want to do something for my God, I want to build him a house, I mean a church. And that is why I have been all out trying to achieve that," she said.
