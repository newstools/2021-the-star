The Ministry of Interior has begun mass distribution of Huduma Cards in Nairobi. The first batch has been dispatched to Huduma Centres across the Nairobi Metropolitan Area and its 17 sub-county offices. Kenyans can conveniently collect their cards after receiving an SMS notification on the same. Last month, the ministry informed Kenyans that it had started mass printing of Huduma Namba cards. In 2020, the government said national IDs will cease being in operation by December 12, 2021, and will be replaced by Huduma Namba cards. The government had said that five million Kenyans will receive their cards this month of February. President Uhuru Kenyatta and First Lady Margaret Kenyatta were handed the first two samples of Huduma Cards on October 20 last year, during the Mashujaa Day celebrations at Gusii Stadium in Kisii County.
