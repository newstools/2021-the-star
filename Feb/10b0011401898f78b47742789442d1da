Kenya’s top table tennis players will be seeking to get Tokyo Olympic Games tickets at the world singles qualification tournament slated for March 14-17 in Doha, Qatar. Top Kenyan player Brian Mutua, Josiah Wandera, Doreen Juma and Lydia Setey have been in training for just one month after almost 10 moths of inactivity due to Covid-19 restrictions. The players have been training twice a day under coach Anthony Mathenge. “We are used to train the whole day and two sessions a day are manageable,” said Wandera. He said they will be operating on the same wave-length with their other counterparts considering their experience of playing in several international tournaments across the globe. “We will be looking for better results because of our experience. We are aware how competitive Doha will be but we want to qualify for the games by qualifying for Olympics,” added Wandera. Coach Anthony Juma said a lot of time was wasted during the coronavirus lock-down and the pressure is on the selected players to deliver. The tactician decried the financial challenges they are facing but affirmed that they will still prevail. The National Olympic Committee of Kenya has entered into a partnership with the Kenya Charity Sweepstake to raise funds for the Olympic teams and athletes for the next five years. The number of slots for qualification to Tokyo will be determined a day before the draw depending on the maximum available quota.
