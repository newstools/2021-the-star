This season’s Victoria Handball Super League (VHSL) kicks off on Saturday at Kanyamedha Secondary School in Kisumu County. Eight men’s and five women’s teams have confirmed participation for the round-robin tournament. Event coordinator Robert Owino said men’s defending champions Kisumu Saints will not participate in the two-day opening leg. He added that Sigalagala National Technical Institute will also not take part in the first round due to the ongoing national exams. Last year, the league was voided midway following the suspension of sports activities due to the coronavirus pandemic with the organisers using first-round results to declare Kisumu Saints and Kisumu Academy Ladies teams as champions. The second leg will be held at Maseno University on March 20-21 while the third will be staged at Sigalagala National Technical Institute on April 10-11. Kisii University will for the first time host VHSL as on May 15-16. Owino said new teams will be allowed to participate in next year’s event. “We have only allowed teams that took part last season to participate in this year’s event. We have also reduced participation fee from Sh8, 000 to Sh4, 000 since last season was not concluded,” Owino told the Star in Kisumu. In the men’s category, Kisumu Academy play hosts Kanyamedha in the opening match while Maseno University battle Kisumu Academy Junior Handball Club. In the women’s category, defending champions Kisumu Academy Ladies will open their campaign against Thea Queens as Kanyamedha Girls play Maseno University.
