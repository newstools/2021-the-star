African governments have the obligation to create enabling democratic environments that promote the rights of young men and women to engage in political leadership. This can only happen when we have domestic and continental legal frameworks and systems that are practically seen to be independent and above the reach of the presidents of respective African nations who do not seem to respect constitutionalism and the rule of law. It is only South Africa which has so far demonstrated that it is capable of holding its heads of state to processes of transparency and accountability. Politically motivated violence, intimidation and excessive monetarisation of political processes continue to exclude young people from engaging in elective politics. A number of these young leaders have unique ideas and innovative programmes that are integral to improving the wellbeing of their fellow youth.  Young leaders such as Uganda’s Bobi Wine should not be subjected to persecution but rather allowed to compete in a free and fair electoral process. The academia, civil society, faith organisations and the media, particularly in recent times in Tanzania and Uganda, need to reclaim their spaces as the conscience of their societies in environments of de-facto perpetual single-party dictatorships. Here in Kenya, whenever we find ourselves in situations where the political class has abandoned the electorate, we have always looked forward to a section of these institutions to reclaim our sanity. Posterity will collectively condemn us as a generation if we became passive witnesses to a shameful public rape of Mother Africa. Governance and finance and project management consultant
