The Judicial Service Commission has distanced itself from Deputy Chief Judtice Philomena Mwilu's suspension. In an application, lawyer Mwongela Isaiah said there are four abuse of office charges pending against Mwilu  and that she should not act as the CJ. In the petition, Isaiah argued that Mwilu’s continued performance of any constitutional duties while facing graft allegation reeks of favouritism and offends the tenure, ideals and spirit of Chapter Six of the Constitution. But in a replying affidavit, JSC said its lack of jurisdiction to conduct criminal trials against judges including the DCJ. According to JSC, its role as decided by the High Court, is to receive complaints against judges and then decide whether the petition discloses ground for removal. If satisfied, the commission will then send the petition to the president who constitutes a tribunal to conduct an inquiry into the matter. In the case of Mwilu, the JSC said it has no responsibility to suspend or ask her to step aside regardless of the standard of moral and ethical probity required. "JSC considers the facts before it and if the facts are overwhelming it recommends to the president to form a tribunal which conducts the trial against the particular judge," the JSC said in the affidavit. The commission has recommended a fast resolve to the matter due to the senior status of Mwilu which it said would otherwise lead to a crisis of loss of confidence in the Judiciary. Apart from her being the Deputy Chief Justice of the Judiciary, Mwilu is a judge of the Supreme Court, a member of the Judicial Service Commission, the acting Chief Justice and acting chair of the JSC. Two weeks ago, the High Court in Meru barred Mwilu from acting as Chief Justice and chairing the Judicial Service Commission following the petition questioning her integrity. After spending a day at home,  Mwilu got a reprieve after the judge lifted her own order stopping her from discharging her duties.
