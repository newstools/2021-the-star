Willis Raburu's estranged wife, Marya Prude, says marriage is a scam. She opened up in a question and answer session with fans on Instagram. One fan proposed marriage to her, to which she responded, "No, is a scam," she wrote. When asked why she didn't fight for her marriage with Raburu, she said, "Someone hold me cause somebody is about to meet their ancestors." She also revealed that she is single. The couple fell out a few weeks after the loss of their unborn child. They wedded in a private ceremony in 2017. They are now living separately but have not announced a divorce as they tied the knot in church.
