Former Nairobi Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko has asked Nairobi residents to pray for him. He made the request on Wednesday through a phone call put on speaker during tributes made at the burial of the late Mukuru kwa Njenga founder Njenga Mwenda Kariuki at the Langata Cemetery. From his hospital bed, Sonko said, “I wish to condole with Njenga’s family as they lay Mzee to rest.” “I also request your prayers. Nairobi residents, please pray for me”. Njenga died  on February 8 in his car on the way to the hospital. He had suffered chest complications for more than 10 years. He was 89. Sonko was admitted at the Nairobi Hospital on Monday last week after complaining of stomach complications and high blood pressure while at the Gigiri police cells. Police picked up the former governor from the hospital for the ruling of his assault case. He was presented in court in the company of an ambulance medic for his two key cases. On Tuesday, the court ordered former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko be confined to a hospital bed until his condition improves. Police were barred from questioning him until he gets well. However, on Wednesday, Special Prosecutor Taib Ali Taib told a court to issue a warrant of arrest against Sonko in a Sh10 million bribery case. Sonko had been ordered to appear in court by Magistrate Douglas Ogoti but failed to. Taib said Sonko has been using his sickness as an excuse not to appear in court.
