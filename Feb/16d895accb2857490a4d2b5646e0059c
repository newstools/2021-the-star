DCI Detectives based in Kabarnet arrested three suspects on Sunday night, for being in possession of ivory. According to a statement by the directorate on Monday, the trio were intercepted as they drove towards Oinobmoi from Barwessa in Baringo, following a report made through an anonymous toll free line. Via Twitter, the DCI said Senior Sergeant Charles Kandagor Kipkulei, attached to the Rift Valley regional Police headquarters was among the arrested suspects. "The suspects are currently being held at Kabarnet Police Station, as further investigative processes ensue," the DCI said. This comes barely a month after detectives arrested a man found in possession of ivory in Busia. County police commander John Nyoike told the Star on the phone that the officers based in Busia received information that the man was selling the product. Nyoike said the detectives after the tip-off moved to Airstrip area where the ivory was kept inside a house to meet Michael Ochokol, the owner. They gained access to the house in which the ivory was kept to meet the dealer. “He was selling the ivory and our officers went disguised as customers and he was arrested,” Nyoike said. “It is not that he was moving them.” The value of the ivory is still not known. Nyoike said the suspect who was arrested on Friday at 3pm will appear in court. Each of the six ivory pieces weighs 7.2kg.
