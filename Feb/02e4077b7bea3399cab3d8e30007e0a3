West Ham United manager David Moyes is convinced on-loan midfielder Jesse Lingard can regain his place in the England squad following the 28-year-old’s double on his debut for the London club in a 3-1 win at Aston Villa on Wednesday. Left out in the cold at Manchester United, Lingard joined the Hammers on loan until the end of the season this week and netted twice in the second half to cap an excellent individual performance in his first Premier League game of the season. “Jesse is still getting used to us and us to him. We are thrilled because he made a difference. If he keeps on like that it won’t be long until he is back in the England squad,” a delighted Moyes told BT Sport. “He made the team better tonight. I felt we were short in areas where we make chances, it is proved tonight that we needed him,” he added. Lingard, whose last England cap came against Switzerland in the Uefa Nations League in June 2019, linked up well with his new teammates, especially striker Michail Antonio who provided the final passes for both of his goals. “We knew it would be difficult but we played well and pressed them. Jesse is the new boy and will get the limelight, but it is a team performance,” said Antonio. “Jesse is an unbelievable player. He plays nice one-two touches with me and (Said) Benrahma. He always wants the ball and shows,” he added. Freed from the frustration of sitting on the bench at Old Trafford, Lingard celebrated his goals with broad smiles as he got his West Ham career off to the best possible start. “The team have been great with me, I have settled in fairly quickly and some familiar faces help. In training we have that connection and built it up fairly quickly,” Lingard said.
