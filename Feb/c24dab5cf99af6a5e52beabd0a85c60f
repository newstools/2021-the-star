ODM party leader Raila Odinga met 2022 presidential candidate Mukhisa Kituyi on Thursday. Raila said the meeting comes after a long time. “Good seeing Daktari Kituyi after such a long time away from home,” Raila said on Twitter. The opposition chief was accompanied by Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana alongside Siaya Senator James Orengo. Kituyi has declared interest in the presidential seat and resigned from his role as secretary general of Unctad. While being interviewed on Radio Jambo this week, Kituyi denied claims he is a "project" of politicians. He also denounced ethnic political alliances and Deputy President William Ruto’s hustler narrative. The ex-Unctad secretary-general said he is his own man and has been driven by convictions to improve the lives of Kenyans. “Don’t think Kituyi is anybody’s project. Tell me, who in this country can employ Kituyi as his project?” Kituyi asked. Kituyi is the latest entrant into the presidential race, with next year's general election still 17 months away. Kituyi said rejuvenating the economy will top his priorities if elected. However, some are doubtful of Kituyi's popularity. Lurambi MP Titus Khamala said on Monday that Kituyi’s political star ceased to shine after he took a diplomatic role in the diaspora. He said the entry of Mukhisa Kituyi into the presidential race will not hurt ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi's support base in Western Kenyan, an MP has said. “Kituyi has the right to run for any seat, and you can’t bar anybody from doing that because it’s his democratic right. But I want him to know that we are behind Musalia and his brother Moses Wetang’ula [of Ford Kenya]. Those are the leaders whom we shall support,” the legislator said in his constituency.
