Parents have been urged to speak to their children to end widespread indiscipline. Assistant chief Lucy Gitau of Gitithia in Kiambu said the most affected are secondary school students who are not concentrating on their education. She said their attention was affected by the long holiday to stop the spread of coronavirus. Gitau said teachers are complaining over moral decay among children. "When you see or hear a teacher telling you to speak to parents because of their children's discipline, don't you think they have tried and leant that we should all participate in that cause?" the assistant chief said. She spoke during the funeral service of a 12-year-old girl who was alleged to have been hit by a teacher at Gitithia Primary School. Mary Wambui died on February 17 at Kenyatta National Hospital where she was receiving treatment after she was referred to that facility from PCEA Kikuyu Hospital. Tears flowed freely from many people at the funeral service led by PCEA Uplands parish minister Lucas Murigu. ECDE teacher Maryanne Nyambura was arraigned last Monday but not take a plea since police said they had not finalised their investigations. Investigating officer Collins Otieno attached to Lari DCI office asked the court to give them 14 days to finalise investigations. Otieno told Limuru resident magistrate Fred Koome that Nyambura was alleged to have caused the death of Wambui between February 1 and February 5, 2021 at Gitithia Primary School in Lari subcounty. Nyambura was arrested on 18 February. Koome declined to give police 14 days to finish investigations and instead, gave them 10 . The case will be mentioned on March 4 when the court will give instructions. Addressing mourners, Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu revisited Education CS George Magoha's proposal to reintroduce corpral punishment, saying he was misleading teachers. Karichu said parents and leaders were not consulted before the CS made theÂ  proposal. Edited by Henry Makori
