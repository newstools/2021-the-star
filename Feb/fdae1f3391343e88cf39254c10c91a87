President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed that Gusii stadium be renamed after the late Simon Nyachae. Addressing mourners on Monday, Uhuru said the stadium will be renamed to Simon Nyachae stadium. "We will give an additional Sh150m to the county to complete the stadium before 2022," Uhuru said. In his Eulogy, Uhuru said that Nyachae was a disciplinarian, not only in disciplining others, but the discipline with which he carried himself. "What he expected of others, is what he expected from himself. What he told us to do, is what he himself did," he said. Noting that he knew Nyachae since he was young, Uhuru said Nyachae held his hands to who he was. "I am also ready to hold hands with your family so that we can continue from where he left," Uhuru said. He further recounted how one of Nyachae's sons - Kenneth- used to beat people whenever he was in trouble. "Kuna kijana ya Nyachae mmoja, wakati tulikuwa vijana tulikuwa tunatembea huko na huku…anaitwa Ken…siku hizo huyu mtu mkienda pahali mambo iwe moto kidogo anachemka haraka haraka, akishindwa na ya kusema, ngumi zimekunjwa tayari," he said.
