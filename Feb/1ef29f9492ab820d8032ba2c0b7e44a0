Members of the National Assembly will hold sittings until 9 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays starting next week. Lawmakers are set to vote to adopt the change of the sittings schedule when they convene on Wednesday morning. There would be no afternoon sitting as the same stands suspended. All Wednesday morning and afternoon sittings will be suspended effective February 17. MPs will thus convene on Tuesdays from 2.30 pm to 6.30 pm and hold another evening sitting from 7 pm to 9 pm. On Thursdays, there will be a sitting in the morning from 10 am to 1 pm; and two others in the afternoon. Parliament has had to adjust its sittings schedule following the restrictions imposed to contain Covid-19 spread. Traditionally, the National Assembly holds afternoon sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with Wednesday having morning and afternoon slots. During the fourth session, House leaders suspended the Tuesday and Thursday sittings owing to the prevailing Covid-19 situation. Life has changed for parliamentarians in the face of efforts to contain the virus, with limited numbers allowed in chamber and committee sittings.
