Mathare United women's team have bolstered their squad with four experienced players ahead of the second leg as the team tries to avoid relegation. Strikers Judith Atieno and Raisy Sylvia have re-signed the slum girls having been out for maternity and lay off respectively. Overlapping fullback Bilha Osong will add steel to the leaky defence. Utility player Veron Akinyi has been training with the side since the season started and will be given a run in the team despite not having any Premier League experience. Mathare United coach Ann Aluoch, believes Mathare can beat the drop should the new strikers adapt immediately and solve the goal-scoring conundrum. Mathare are languishing at the bottom of the table in zone A with zero points. The team has scored once in seven matches and conceded 24 times hence their survival in the top tier hangs in the balance. "Our main agenda is staying in the league. The team has been firing blanks in front of goal and inexperience is the cause of our troubles. Now we have quality players with the know-how to bail us out  during this difficult moment," said the former Starlets captain. Aluoch was part of Starlets team that made it's debut in the African Women's Cup of Nations in 2016.  The 30-year-old pointed out that Mathare have to win their first two matches of the second leg to have a mathematical chance of surviving. Mathare's closest opponents, Makolanders and Kibera Soccer have four and six points respectively. "Registering victory in  the first two games will give us a fighting edge over other teams that are also in the mix. We stand a chance with six points and the remaining five games will be like finals,"said Aluoch who played in the Norway Cup at the age of 14 years. "We need to find consistency in goalkeeping department, avoid conceding needless goals and find the right balance at both ends of the pitch," said Aluoch who is a coach-cum-player.
