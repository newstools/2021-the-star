Narok Senator Ledama Olekina said he missed ODM leader Raila Odinga's rally on Sunday, Valentine's Day, to spend time with loved ones at home. Ledama, elected on an ODM ticket, also said he was not a member of Covenant Church International that hosted the former Prime Minister. Raila later attended a town rally. “I was spending time with my wife on this special Valentine's Day because this is the day for loved ones," he told the Star on the phone. Raila was wooing the Maa community. Ledama said a Maa nation meeting will be held on Saturday at his Eor Ekule home in Narok East. Raila was accompanied by Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko, MPs Moitalel ole Kenta (Narok North) James Nyikal (Seme), Otiende Omollo (Rarieda), Woman Representative Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay), Kanchory Memusi (Kajiado Central) and Wilson Sossion (nominated). Raila called upon Maa community to fully back the BBI Bill, saying it will address the historical injustices that victimised the community. When asked whether he is planning to join Deputy President William Ruto's hustler's movement, Ledama denied that, saying he is still in ODM. “All the people should know that I am an independent leader and my thinking is different from who they thought I was,” he said. On January 16, Nominated MP David Sankok urged the vocal Ledama to leave ODM and join the hustler movement. He said ODM was mistreating Ledama because he was from the Maasai community and promised he would be in safe and respectful hands with the hustlers allied to DP Ruto. (Edited by V. Graham)
