Kenya Cup champions KCB have withdrawn from the Charity Cup fixture against Enterprise Cup holders Kabras slated for February 20. KCB chairman Xavier Makuba said the game against their bitter rivals came early and have written a letter to the union indicating their pull out from the high profile fixture. “This game has come early for us because our team only started training on Monday. This means we only have two and half weeks to prepare for such a high profile game. So, we opted out to ensure our boys are ready for the start of the season a week later," observed Makuba. Makuba said the target for the bankers is to emulate the great Nondies team of the 80's and 90's and win the coveted league crown for the fourth year running. "Our target is to win the league for the fourth year running. It's only been done by Nondies many years ago. However, we are aware it will be tough season especially due to the short turnaround time but I am confident in the boys and the management team to do a good job,” added Makuba. Makuba said the club conducted the return to play Covid-19 tests last week with all players turning out negative results. The core of the side that did duty before the season has remained intact and will include the likes of internationals Curtis Lilako, Olivier Mangeni, Davis Chenge in the forwards with Jacob Ojee, Darwin Mukidza, Shaban Ahmed, Samuel Asati, among others in the backs. The bankers are expected to open their campaign against a promoted team from the Championship on February 27. The season will run for 11 weeks with the top four teams qualifying for the semi-finals on May 22. The winners of the semi-final encounters will play in the Kenya Cup final on  May 29. Sources close to the union said the Charity Cup fixture will be played at Nyayo Sadium with 3000 fans expected and will conform to Covid-19 protocols with sanitizers and social distancing expected to feature in the event.
