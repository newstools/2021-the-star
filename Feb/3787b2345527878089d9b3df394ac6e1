Over 18,000 students from Mombasa will benefit from this year’s Sh150 million county bursary fund. The administration has set aside four days when major events will be held to issue bursary cheques to all beneficiaries. Speaking on Wednesday, Education chief officer John Musuva said Governor Hassan Joho will meet the people in designated areas. “Unlike the previous years, where we only had one bursary issuance event. This year, we will have four in each of our subcounties,” Musuva said. On Thursday, the governor issued bursary cheques to over 4,000 beneficiaries in Mwahima grounds, and on Friday, he will be in Mvita for another 4,000 beneficiaries. On Monday, the governor will give out 5,500 cheques to Changamwe and Jomvu residents at Changamwe Social Hall. On Tuesday, Joho will be in Frere Town grounds for over 8,000 Nyali and Kisauni residents. Over 13,000 secondary schoolchildren, 1,700 university students, 1,200 college students, 1, 600 driving students, and 710 students with special needs will benefit “We expect this bursary to benefit students with special needs, those in secondary school, colleges and universities,” Musuva said, adding that they received overwhelming applications. “The governor is planning to have another round of bursary funds before the end of this financial year. We might give out Sh150 million or Sh200 million depending on availability of funds,” Musuva said. He said at least 95 per cent of all applicants were successful. Musuva said since 2015 when the Elimu Fund was established, they have disbursed in excess of Sh750 million to over 80,000 students. Joho’s event in Frere Town grounds comes one week after his critic, Nyali MP Mohammed Ali, hosted Deputy President William Ruto at the same place. Ruto gave out Sh1.5 million to boda boda riders. Ali also commissioned Kwa Bulo Primary and Kwa Bulo Secondary schools funded by the Nyali CDF.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
