Clinical officers have called off their strike after 70 days, following a court order. The Labour Court through Justice Maureen Onyango issued an order requiring them to resume work immediately. Addressing journalists on Tuesday, Kenya Union of Clinical officers chairman Peter Wachira directed all members to report back to work. But the clinicians said that the issues that pushed them out of their workstations remain unresolved. "We left work because the working environment was not safe. As we go back we know we are going to suffer because nothing has changed. We urge members not to work in an environment where you know the environment is not safe," Wachira said. Wachira added that there has been a big crisis in the health sector because of lack of a health service commission. "We were the ones who were spreading Covid-19 because of lack of proper personal protective equipment. Since we went on strike no healthcare worker has lost their lives due to Covid." More to follow
