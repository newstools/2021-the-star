We won't reconnect your water supply for free. That's what the Bomet administration has told their neighbour Kericho county. The Bomet Water Company serves residents in both counties, but Kericho has yet to pay a bill amounting to Sh40 million. Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony disputes that billing by Hillary Barchok's administration. Chepkwony has accused Bomet of overcharging them and pledged to construct a water treatment plant. The county is charged Sh30 for every 1,000 litres supplied. On Monday, Barchok through Water executive Peter Tonui asked Kericho to settle the bill or part of it to get water flowing again. The supply was cut last year. “What we only require from them is to show commitment. They can pay in bits… the problem with them is that they just do not want to pay us and that is why we have also stood our ground on this matter,” Tonui said. “We no longer need agreements because all that we have signed with them are not being honoured at all.” Kericho Water executive Geoffrey Ruto was not available for comment. As the row rages, Buret residents and vital institutions like Litein and Kapkatet hospitals and schools and colleges in the area remain without water. Tonui said the last time Kericho paid for water was in June last year through a Sh2 million cheque. The executive said the meagre pay showed Kericho's unwillingness to pay. Buret residents, he noted, should blame their government for “unnecessarily charging them but failing to remit the dues” to the relevant service provider. (edited by o. owino)
