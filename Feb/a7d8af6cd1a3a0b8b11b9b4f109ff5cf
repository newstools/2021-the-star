ODM leader Raila Odinga is doing the 'donkey work' of helping pass the BBI bill, but he will still lose in the 2022 presidential election, Kuria MPs have said. Kuria East MP Marwa Kitayama and his Kuria West counterpart Mathias Robi said on Tuesday that the passing of the BBI would not hurt Deputy President William Ruto's support in the region. They spoke to the Star on the phone ahead of the tabling of the Constitution Amendment Bill, 2020, in the Migori county assembly. The two legislators said Migori is cosmopolitan and the passing of the report is only being pushed by MCAs from the Luo community and not from the Kuria minority. "As Kuria community, we have not taken part in what is happening in the assembly. Let Raila do the donkey work of passing the BBI bill. Our energy is reserved for 2022 when we will ensure Deputy President William Ruto becomes President," Kitayama said. Robi said the Kuria community sought their own county or an additional constituency, but that was not factored in the BBI. "We know assemblies passing the report have external forces like in Migori. We know even the National Assembly and the Senate will pass it, but Kenyans will have the final say," Robi said. "As Kenyans and supporters of Ruto, we don't care if it passes or not. Our main aim will be the 2022 presidential election." The two said Raila should retire with President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2022.
