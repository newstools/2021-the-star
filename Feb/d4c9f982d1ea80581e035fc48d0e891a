Police in Voi, Taita Taveta County have arrested five suspected criminals with two cars bearing fake number plates. Police said the five were hatching a plan to rob off valuable from unsuspecting people using the cars. Confirming the Tuesday evening arrest, the County Commander Patrick Okeri said police responded to a tip-off from locals after they saw the two vehicles suspiciously packed outside banks in Voi Town. “We received information that one vehicle had been suspiciously parked outside Cooperative bank and another at Kenya Commercial Bank. A team of officers visited the area where they arrested the suspects,” he said. Several fake number plates, Okeri said, were recovered hidden inside the vehicles. Other items recovered were phones, watches and a bundle of unknown amounts of money stuffed in an envelope. Okeri said the suspects might be members of a syndicate that was planning to rob the banks. “The suspects had already changed number plates of one of the vehicles and were ready to bounce on their target,” he said pointing out that they shall be arraigned in court on Friday to face charges of planning to commit felony. The county boss said preliminary investigations have shown that the suspects break into cars at parking areas and steal laptops and other valuables. Investigations have further revealed that the suspects had arrived from Mombasa where they had stolen valuables and that they were later headed to Naivasha where they operate from. Police have launched further investigations to ascertain the ownership of the vehicles and arrest more suspects linked to the syndicate. “Those making fake number plates are on our radar and we shall soon bring them to book,” he added. He urged members of the public to report cases of insecurity on time in a bid to keep the region crime free.
