Big hitter Dismas Indiza yesterday fired his way to the top of the leaderboard as a field of 21 players survived the six over par second round cut. The hunt for the top prize proper at the par 71 Muthaiga Golf Club course begins this morning. The birdie-hungry Indiza, who dropped only one shot at the par four-sixth, had made three straight pars before picking up his first birdie of the day at the fourth. It was, however, his three back-to-back birdies from the seventh to the ninth for a low front nine of three under par, which apparently triggered the day’s six under par 65, with an additional two birdies at the start and close of the back nine. “Today was not bad at although it could have been even better if I did not bogey at the sixth. I am happy that today’s round pushed me to the top. The course was playing well and the greens holding well. I think it’s because of the morning rains,” said Indiza. He starts today’s third round with a two rounds total of five under par 137 and in the company of Zimbabwe’s Robson Chinhoi and new-comer in the Safari Tour, Dayne Moore from Zambia. Chinhoi shot four under par 67 to tie with Moore, a regular player in the Sunshine Tour. Chinhoi blasted four birdies at the front nine’s first, third, fourth and seventh for a four under par 32 at the front nine. He started the back nine well with a birdie four at the 10th and a late one at the 17th though he dropped a shot at the 12th and at the home green. Moore from Ndola Golf Club in Zambia’s Copperbelt Province, shot one under par 70 for a two rounds total of two under par 140 to tie for the second place. Three other players tied on one under par 141. They included Golf Park’s Tony Omuli, who shot four under par 67 in the second round while Sigona Golf Club’s John Wangai shot one under par 70. Though he is four shots behind the leader, Wangai said he is out to win the event. “I have not won any Safari Tour event and if I play in the last two rounds the way I played today, I should finish at the top. The course was playing well with the greens holding well after the rain,” said Wangai. It was a tough outing for overnight leader Jay Sandhu, who bogeyed a number of holes for the day’s 79 to drop to 12th, although he comfortably made the cut.
