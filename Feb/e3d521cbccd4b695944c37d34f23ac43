Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Premier League outfit Kakamega Homeboyz head coach Nicholas Muyoti wants his charges to focus in the remaining matches to avoid soaking in cheap goals as witnessed in previous matches. The tactician said the trend at which they are soaking in goals was worrying, considering their target was fight for top honours this season. “This situation is worrying to the technical bench. We have lost a lot of points due to this and it's slowly killing our ambition and objectives. We will try to fix the problem before our next match against AFC Leopards," he noted. He added: “It has taken us a lot of time to settle but I believe we are on the right track. We want to work very hard and ensure the players attain the right match fitness and good bonding which is key for our campaign." However, Muyoti said it's too early to rule us out  the team. "We just want to urge the players to raise concentration in the 90 minutes and remain focused. The must take each match at a time and we try to work things out ahead of the second leg that will basically be the determining factor,” Muyoti stated. Former Kenyan international called upon his players to take each match seriously   and caution players against complacency especially after finishing runners up last  season. He predicted a very competitive league season, urging players to strive to keep pace with the leaders. Homeboyz are in position 12 with 15 points from 13 matches and play AFC Leopards on Sunday at Bukhungu Stadium
