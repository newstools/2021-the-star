The Nairobi County government and the National Olympic Committee of Kenya have drafted a Memorandum of Understanding to establish the first OlympAfrica Youth Centre at Ruai in Embakasi Constituency. Acting Governor Anne Kananu said the two parties will  finalise and sign the MoU within three days. "I was a judoka, as well as a centre in basketball, therefore I know the power of sport to the youth. The county is in full support of the development of the youth centre in Embakasi. We hope that the same can be implemented in the 17 sub-counties of Nairobi," Kananu said. This paves way for work on the project to commence as soon as possible beginning with an inspection of the allocated land by OlympAfrica Foundation heads. "The operational aspects will be done according to the environment. The multipurpose centre will allow youth to try different sports. It will also be developed in a sustainable model, derived from best use of the resources and continuous funding to sustain the program," NOC-K's acting secretary general Francis Mutuku said. OlympAfrica Youth Centre will be a sports talent development project in addition to hosting various sporting, cultural and economic activities. Kananu and Mutuku were speaking at the former's office where NOC-K executive members had paid a courtesy call on the acting governor. Speaking at the same meeting, Janet Ouko, the county executive for Education, Youth, Sports, Gender Affairs, Culture and Social Services, affirmed the county government's full support for the project. "We wouldn’t want to let this opportunity pass for the youth of Nairobi. We need to take advantage of all opportunities to improve the quality of life. We will make sure the project has started well and that is why we have started by giving you the MOU today, and certificate of lease, to assist your office as you proceed with the plans," she said. OlympAfrica has committed funds of up to Sh35 million as seed money to finance the project.
