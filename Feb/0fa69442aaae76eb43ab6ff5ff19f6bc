President Uhuru Kenyatta has eulogised Bonchari MP John Oroo Oyioka who passed away on Monday as an accomplished educator and determined legislator. Oyioka, a retired teacher and education official, was a second-term MP elected on a People's Democratic Party ticket. He died at a Kisumu hospital after a long illness. In his message of comfort and encouragement to the legislator's family, Uhuru described the MP as a determined leader who always sought and worked for the improvement of his constituents through education. “It is a pity that death has robbed us of a determined and progressive grassroots leader who used his long experience as a teacher and administrator to develop his constituents through education. “Oyioka's love for education is demonstrated in his setting up of a private teachers college to serve his community after his retirement from public service. "That was a selfless leader who knew and appreciated the transformative value of empowering the youth through education," Uhuru eulogised. The Head of State prayed to God to give the family, relatives, friends and the residents of Bonchari the fortitude and strength to bear the loss of their leader. The family said that the MP died at the Aga Khan hospital in Kisumu after a long illness. His death comes hours after the burial of former cabinet minister Simeon Nyachae. He was sponsored to the Parliament during the 2017 general election by the Kenya African National Union and a Coalition Member of The People’s Democratic Party (PDP). National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi mourned Oyioka as an active member of the Departmental Committee on Education, Research, and Technology. Muturi added that he will Oyioka will be remembered for his advocacy towards improved quality of education in the country.
