The Homa Bay government has lifted an exemption on revenue collection from open-air markets that was intended to cushion traders against Covid-19. The exemption came into effect in March last year when Governor Cyprian Awiti directed the Finance department not to collect revenue from traders operating in open-air markets. The move was aimed at cushioning traders from adverse effects of coronavirus. But speaking on Monday, Governor Awiti lifted the suspension. This means the county government officials will start collecting revenue from traders in the markets. “My administration intervened on the hard economic situation our people were undergoing due to the outbreak of Covid-19. We exempted traders in open-air markets from paying taxes,” Awiti said. The governor who spoke in his office said the decision has been made to enable the county government to get funds for undertaking development activities. He told traders to cooperate with the county officials to avoid any conflict in the matter. The governor said his administration had been lenient to traders, hence they should also understand. “Let traders now pay taxes because we need money for undertaking development projects,” Awiti said. Traders appealed to the county government officials not to harass them as they resume revenue collection. Homa Bay County Giant Traders Association chairman Geoffrey Onduso said the revenue collection should be implemented with a humane face. “We thank the county government for exempting us from taxation for that duration and we welcome the new move. However, we call on the county officials not to harass us because covid-19 is still with us,” he said. He called for peaceful collaboration between traders and the county revenue officers. “We are going to cooperate with the county government officials to ensure we grow our economy together,” Onduso said.
