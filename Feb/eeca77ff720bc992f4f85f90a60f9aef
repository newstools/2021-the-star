Kenya Export Promotion and Branding Agency has signed a memorandum of understanding with Kenya Trade Network Agency (KenTrade) that will enable the two and institutions create synergies in driving various initiatives. This is expected to ensure seamless flow of cross border trade both across Kenya’s borders and within the region. This will ensure more collaboration of export promotion initiatives and more trade for Kenya in the long run. The two Agencies will ride on each other’s programs to boost cross-border trade and promote Kenya exports. Speaking during the signing ceremony, Keproba CEO Wilfred Marube said the agency from 2019 has been working on digitizing export procedures and transactions with the aim of making it easier for the buyer and seller to meet. Creating synergies with KenTrade, he said, will assist in realizing this since KenTrade has a history of connecting buyers and sellers. He said that the agency is seeking to address how they can facilitate normal Kenyan Traders to reach the global market and become exporters. “This MOU will address this aspect through the envisioned exporters’ academy which will build the capacity of traders through product development and trade advisories for export ready traders,’’Marube said. KenTrade CEO Amos Wangora said a priority to the agency is facilitating how fast exports can get to the global market which will give Kenya a competitive edge. “This will be made possible through simplification of the export process which forms some of the provisions in the MOU,” Wangora. The agency is also in the process of rolling out an e-commerce platform for exporters that will connect buyers and sellers on the platform and boost Kenya exports.
