Busia police are searching for two men who fatally shot prominent businessman Alfred Abayo on Monday night. Abayo was shot at close range by the two men who posed as customers at his Texas Annex hotel in town, his daughter Emily Otuoni said. Nothing was stolen and the motive was not immediately known. The gunmen walked out casually. County police commander John Nyoike told the Star on Tuesday no arrests had been made. Otuoni said her father was shot three times, in the chest, neck and abdomen. He died at once. “They did not steal anything from him and we have no idea what the motive of the shooting could be,” she said. On Tuesday, Busia  Governor Sospeter Ojamong condemed the murder. He said Abayo had worked hard to grow the hotel industria in the county. “I urge police to move fast and ensure the suspects are brought to book,” he said. CCTV should be installed in all significant areas, the governor said. On Tuesday morning, family members  camped at Tanaka Mortuary to view the body but they were not given immediate clearance by police. “It is unfair to stop us from viewing his body. I travelled all the way from Nairobi  and the police won't let us in until we are taken to the shooting scene,” a daughter said. Abayo worked as a fisheries officer in former Bondo and Kisumu districts. He quit civil service in Bondo and ventured into business. In October last year, another Busia-based businessman was shot dead at his home in Siaya county. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
