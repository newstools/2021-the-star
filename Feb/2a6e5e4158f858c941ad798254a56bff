Lamu residents should expect invasion by wildlife animals in their residences but have been warned against killing any of them. In a statement, the region’s Kenya Wildlife Service office warned residents of wildlife invasion such as buffaloes, lions, hyenas and wild dogs in search of food and water. The statement urged residents to instead call the KWS office in the region on a prescribed hotline for prompt evacuation and not in any way harm the animals. Lamu county KWS boss Mathias Mwavita warned that some of the animals like lions and buffaloes could turn lethal when hunted and that it would only be safe for the locals to seek out the KWS rangers upon seeing or encountering the animals. He said much of their exodus has been caused by drought and also deforestation which has destroyed many of their habitats leaving the wildlife exposed and vulnerable. “We should expect to see these animals around us but we should kill them. Instead, call us so we will ensure they are safely driven away,” he said. Mwavita warned residents against invading wildlife habitats to set up settlements and farms saying the situations only worsens human-wildlife conflicts in the region. “Most of the problems people here face from wildlife are actually created by the people themselves. They clear the forest and build houses or turn them into farms. Do we ask ourselves where these animals will eventually end up if not in those very homes built on their habitats‚? Mwavita posed. Last week, with the permission of the KWS office, Lamu island residents hunted down and killed a 120-pound hyena that had mauled over 1500 donkeys over a two year period. The office, however, stressed that no other wildlife should be killed without their permission.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
