Ugandan rising star Rajiv Ruparelia says he is hoping to give Kenyans a run for their money when the season-opening KCB Nakuru Rally gets underway in Soysambu this weekend. The “fast and furious” driver is determined to ruffle feathers on his Kenya National Rally Championship debut under the guidance of Enoch Olinga in a VW Polo Proto. Although the Ugandan is a new entrant in motorsport, he is not ruling out a great fight with his Kenyan race adversaries. “I hope Kenyans are ready for Ruparelia Rally Team. We are coming to take the title in Nakuru with the much-needed intensity and gusto,” Ruparelia bantered. Last year was going to be his first competitive year on his home championship but he only covered two events due to the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. Rajiv displayed an impressive performance during Day One of Mbarara Rally last year, where he posted fastest stage times on the opening day of the season. The fast driver topped the first stage of the event and shared the super special stage with former Pearl of Africa winner Ponsiano Lwakataka, each winning one run. Ruparelia also did two events in 2019 as a club man competitor. However, he is yet to show his worth since he has not finished in a top position following a series of mishaps. The KCB Nakuru Rally 2021 will start and end at Soysambu ranch featuring 175Km total mileage. The event will also feature a three-stage loop which will be repeated for a total competitive distance of 141km. The competitive run makes up 80 per cent of the rally total. The three stages that will be repeated as first and second loops are Soysambu (32.10km), Elementaita (18.79km) and Sleeping Warrior (19.80km). Drivers will nevertheless encounter a relatively shorter transport road section of 34.42km.
