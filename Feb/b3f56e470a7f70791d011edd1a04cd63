The government will clear all outstanding arrears owed to the Kenya national basketball team, Morans, Sports CS Amina Mohammed has promised. Amina said the government is concerned about improving all players' welfare in a  bid to prepare them for the upcoming international competitions in their respective disciplines. "I also urge the officials of all federations to work closely with the ministry  and  provide the requisite data to facilitate the release of cash awards. Your collaboration will secure our joint accountability and smooth release of the cash awards," Amina said. She also informed the Morans of the government's plans to facilitate a pre-competition camp for the team before they head out to their East African neighbours for the continental showpiece from  August 24 to September 5. "I direct the office of the Acting Commissioner for Sports to ensure all the training needs of the team and competition pre-requisites are addressed in a timely and properly synchronised manner," Amina said. The CS was speaking at Carnivore Restaurant during a luncheon to honour the team after their arrival from Yaounde, Cameroon, where they were battling for a ticket in the FIBA AfroBasket qualifiers. They beat 11-time African champions Angola 74-73 to achieve their mission despite losing to Senegal and Mozambique. Amina praised national team coach Liz Mills for the hard work she has put in to improve the team's performance. "Through her leadership and indeed, your discipline, respect and commitment, you have defied all odds nationally, regionally and internationally. I do not have to mention that your cooperation and team cohesion sets a monumental example to everyone watching from all corners of the world," she said. The CS urged more corporate bodies to come on board and supports sports in the country.
