Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga's ODM party has now announced it will be holding nationwide grassroots elections ahead of 2022. This is departure from the earlier position where the party was to carry out harmonisation to fill in vacant positions. ODM party Deputy Secretary General Agnes Zani said the National Election Board will issue timetable for the countrywide exercise. "That the party immediately embarks on grassroots elections exercise at the polling stations level in accordance with the party constitution," Zani said. She added: "The National Elections Board to convene an urgent meeting to set the dates for the exercise." The meeting was chaired by party leader Raila Odinga and was also attended by national chairman John Mbadi, Executive Director Oduor Ong'wen, MPs Tim Wanyonyi (Westlands), Esther Passaris (Nairobi MP), Justus Kizito (Shinyalu) among other officials. The party also directed that 13 Nairobi MCAs who appeared before the disciplinary committee tender written apologies to the party. The MCAs were Cecilia Ayot, Wilson Ochola, Nicholas Okumu, Hafsa Khalif, Maurice Gari, Caroline Mayunzu, Millicent Akinyi Okatch, David Okello, Redson Otieno, Jared Okode, David Mbithi, Duke Hasira, Callen Ateya.
