Kenya Swimming Federation has released a provisional squad of 13 swimmers for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. However, only two will be eligible to participate at the extravaganza slated for July 23- August 8 according to the country's quota allocation. The country was represented by Hamdan Bayusuf and Talissa Lanoe at the Rio Olympics with Jason and David Dunford flying the flag at the London and Beijing Olympics in 2012 and 2008. Mohamed Issa, Mohammed Ridhwan, Maina Monyo, Harunani Maaahir, Tabuka Bifwoli, Danilo Rosaflio and Talib Swaleh in the boys' category. In the girls' category, Sylvia and Maria Brunhlener make the cut alongside United States-based Rebecca Kamau, Emily Muteti, Lucia Ruchti and Imara Bella Thorpe. Announcing the squad on Thursday, interim Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) chairman Patrick Muyah said a good number of the swimmers are training in their respective bases under their coaches and that the final two swimmers will be chosen based on their qualification times. "We have a strong squad to choose from and it will boil down to the qualification times they post in respective races,” said Muyah. Muyah said plans are underway to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the South Africa swimming association for Kenyan swimmers top train down south."It's not just for the present but it's a long term deal which we hope will improve our swimmers. South Africa has excellent facilities and coaches and I am confident we will reap the rewards in many years to come,” added Muyah. Elsewhere, stakeholders have raised doubts on the national elections being held any time soon. The elections were due to be held on January 30 but were shelved since the roadmap was not followed. “Something is not right. We had a meeting last week to have the notices sent out but a week later, the notices are yet to be sent out. Something is not right,” said a source.
