Somalia’s leaders have failed to break a deadlock over the country’s elections, with no clear path to a vote just days before the government’s mandate expires. The country is likely to miss the February 8 deadline for choosing a new president. This is after days of negotiations between the central government and federal states collapsed on Friday, the Guardian reports. In 2017, Somalia's MPs elected Mohamed Farmajo - a Somali-US national - as the country's new president in a vote held in an aircraft hangar. Ex-Prime Minister Farmajo beat President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in a surprise result. The vote was held at the heavily guarded airport complex in the capital, Mogadishu, as the rest of the country was too dangerous. Traffic was banned and a no-fly zone imposed over the city to prevent attacks by militant Islamists.
