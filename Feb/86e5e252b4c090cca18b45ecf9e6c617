The East Africa Legislative Assembly wants heads of East Africa Community Lake Victoria Basin Commission and other institutions to serve for more than one term. The MPs said a five-year nonrenewable tenure for executive secretary of East Africa institutions is short and hurts services and the community. “Eala urges the Council of Ministers to direct the EAC Ad hoc Service Commission to expedite the recruitment process for all vacancies in organs and institutions of the community. "The assembly further wants EAC Council of Ministers to take into consideration the tenure of Head of Institution (LVBC), and the need for the community to retain highly qualified and experienced experts,” they say. A report of the Committee on Agriculture, Tourism and Natural Resources on the On-Spot Assessment of the Lake Victoria Basin was presented to the House in Arusha by Mathias Kasamba. It noted that perennial understaffing is hindering the Lake Victoria Basin Commission from achieving its objectives. “The position of Deputy Executive Secretary at LVBC and various other posts need to be filled urgently,” the report states. According to a press release from Eala, member Oburu Oginga reiterated that staffing is critical for efficient delivery of services. The committee held interactive meetings with the management of the LVBC where it was informed of its functions, activities and programmes as well as the institution’s achievements and challenges. Last Year, Eala enacted the Lake Victoria Basin Commission 2020 Bill, providing a legal framework for the LVBC to be an institution and a corporate body of the community. Under the arrangement, the LVBC is expected to be responsible for among other duties, the coordination of stakeholder participation in the sustainable development of natural resources of the Lake Victoria basin, and harmonisation of policies, laws, regulations and standards.
