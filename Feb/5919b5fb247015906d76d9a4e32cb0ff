Yara has launched a new planting fertiliser targeting smallholder maize farmers in Migori and Homa Bay ahead of the long-rains planting season. On Tuesday, Yara East Africa met retailers, distributors and agro-dealers in Rongo town to launch MiCrop fertiliser. The special blend cuts above Diammonium phosphate used for planting maize and Calcium ammonium nitrate used for top dressing and which cause high acidity in soils. Yara East Africa senior commercial manager Vitalis Wafula said the new fertiliser has a special blend called MiCrop that contains five extra nutrients needed to boost root and cob formation. “MiCrop fertiliser that we have introduced to the market will help maize plant develop a strong rooting system that allows absorption of the required nutrients and water,” he said. “That way, a maize plant will have sufficient energy to grow tall, having two to three full cobs per plant." The fertiliser provides phosphorus, sulphur, potassium and zinc that are low in most arable soils across the country. “Farmers using the MiCrop fertiliser can now expect to harvest about 30-35 bags per acre depending on whether the specific farmer has followed the right agronomical practices that we at Yara East Africa offer in partnership with other players and the county government,” Wafula said. Before the launch, the firm conducted trials on several farms, including Sylvance Araja's farm in Sakwa village, Awendo. Araja said with normal fertiliser, he harvested 18-20 bags of maize an acre, which increased to 36 bags in the same size using MiCrop. Migori agriculture executive Valentine Ogongo said the partnership and training offered by Yara to farmers during the launch will go a long way in boosting food security in the area. “We are happy that the Yara MiCrop range (planting and topdressing) will increase maize yields considering that maize is the staple food in most Kenyan households, thus the demand for it is always there,” he said.
