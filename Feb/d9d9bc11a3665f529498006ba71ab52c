A man who defiled his seven-year old step-daughter has been arrested in Nyeri county. The 48-Year-old man who committed the crime on Tuesday, was arrested on Wednesday night by DCI detectives. According to the DCI director George Kinoti, the suspect, a casual labourer at Nairutia centre, is said to have defiled the vulnerable minor when her mother was away. The man then later left the girl helpless and went to his workplace. Kinoti said that the suspect resides in a two bedroom house with his wife and the victim. "The three share one of the bedrooms and a common bed, leaving the other room unoccupied," he said. The DCI said that in company of two female neighbours in whose home the girl had sought refuge, the grade one pupil narrated her ordeal to the shock of Gender Desk officers, moments before the suspect was traced and nabbed. The victim has since been given medical attention, and the clothes worn on the fateful night secured for forensic examination. The DCI has thanked the said responsible neighbours for their assistance and sensitivity with which they handled the delicate case, and urges continued cooperation with the public in keeping our children safe.
