The government will pay Sh1.37 billion for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine doses to be delivered at the end of this month. Kenya will receive 4,176,000 doses, according to a schedule shared by Unicef, Gavi and the World Health Organization. Unicef confirmed each of the dose will be sold at Sh330 ($3), having already been subsidised. “Sharing pricing information is also a reflection to Unicef’s commitment to transparency, which we have been demonstrating for the past ten years by publishing all negotiated prices for a range of commodities,” said the agency’s executive director Henrietta Fore in a statement. The vaccines are mainly manufactured by India’s Serum Institute. They will be bought for about 92 poor countries through the Covax facility, but Unicef will use its expertise to transport them. Unicef said it has stockpiled 500 million syringes for the injections. According to the vaccine distribution schedule for the 92 countries, Uganda will get 3,552,000 doses, Rwanda 1,098,960, Somalia 1,224,000, South Sudan 864,000, Ethiopia 8,928,000. Tanzania and Burundi will not receive doses because they did not apply for any. Nearly all African countries will only receive the AstraZeneca vaccine except South Africa which will get 2,976,000 of AstraZeneca vaccine and 117,000 of the Pfizer jab; and Rwanda 996,000 (AstraZeneca) and 102,960 (Pfizer). Cape Verde and Tunisia will also get both. Gavi said the scheduled quantities were tentative and may change. It also noted the AstraZeneca vaccine is yet to receive the WHO emergency use authorization, a precondition before shipping under Covid-19. The authorisation is expected by February 15 after which the shipping will begin. “The exact delivery after allocation will depend on the sequence of countries in the shipment plan, the time taken to place the purchase order, legal / regulatory obligations, as well as the supplier’s lead time and related logistics,” Gavi said. The AstraZeneca vaccine requires two doses per person given three or four weeks apart. However, Kenya might consider giving just one dose. A new study in the UK showed one dose provides sustained protection against Covid-19 for at least three months and cuts transmission of the virus by two-thirds. The data, published in the Lancet, shows the first shot conferred an average 76 per cent protection against symptomatic infections from three weeks until 90 days, and reduced transmission of the disease by 67 per cent. Giving just one dose will allow Kenya  to prioritise more vulnerable people and health workers. According to Health CS Mutahi Kagwe, Kenya plans to vaccinate at least 1.25 million Kenyans between February and June. During this period, frontline healthcare workers, all staff working in health facilities and workers offering essential services will be inoculated, with priority given to sectors such as security. The second phase is expected to run from July 2021 to June 2022 during which 9.7 million more Kenyans will receive the jab depending on availability of the vaccines. The target population in this phase will be Kenyans aged above 50 years and those above 18 years of age with underlying health conditions.
