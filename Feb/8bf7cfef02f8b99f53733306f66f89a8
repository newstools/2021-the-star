The Budalangi disaster management and security committee has banned disco matanga to curb rampant defilement cases. This comes after a 17-year-old girl was raped and killed in the neighbouring Funyula constituency. The committee members convened last week Thursday at the sub-county headquarters and resolved to ban disco matanga in the area. Deputy county commissioner said they have banned the night discos popularly known as disco matanga to protect girls from rapists. He said disciplinary action would be taken against any chief or assistant chief who fail to obey the directive by allowing the disco matanga in their area of jurisdiction. “Chief's and their assistants must do everything to ensure that the directive is strictly followed and adhered to. Any chief or assistant chief who will fail to enforce the directive will be dealt with accordingly,” said the deputy county commissioner. On Tuesday last week, the body of a class six girl who had been reported missing by her parents was found raped, killed and her body dumped on the neighbour's farm. According to Namuduru sub-location assistant chief Josephat Makokha, the pupil met her death on Saturday night while returning home in the company of her two colleagues after attending a disco matanga. He said her body was found half-naked. However, two of the pupils who had accompanied the deceased on the fateful night, all in class eight narrated how they tried to fight off a man a few metres away from the main gate of the home where the disco matanga was happening without success. The two girls said they managed to set themselves free from the man's grip and ran away adding that their colleague failed to escape. They said their efforts to get assistance from the area residents was futile due to the high music volume. However, the law enforcement officers from Funyula constituency have already launched a manhunt for the killers.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
