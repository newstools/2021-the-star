There is no way ODM will support a candidate running for president on another party ticket. If ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi wants Raila Odinga's support, he should join ODM and take part in the party nominations with other aspirants. To get the ticket he would have to beat Raila, governors Wycliffe Oparanya and Hassan Joho, and others hopefuls. Let me emphasise that we have enough aspirants in ODM. We do not need to back anybody from another party. The party has already advertised and applicants have until February 26 to submit their applications. If Mudavadi wants our support, let him pay Sh1 million non-refundable fee to participate in the nominations. He should leave ANC and join ODM. The forms are available and he is very much welcome to participate in the nominations. Even the Holy Bible says that when a father wants to bless someone, he will start with his house. A father would not go to bless the children of another house before doing the same to his own. Therefore, there is absolutely no chance that ODM will support another party's candidate. We have participated in elections before and won as ODM. People should not create the notion that ODM must be in a coalition to win an election. At the end of the day, the person who will become President will be one who is best suited to lead the country. What is this that Mudavadi has that Raila must support him? What is this expertise that he will bring to the table that Raila does not have? His track record cannot even compare with that of Oparanya. Oparanya has been governor for eight years and has done a good job for residents of Kakamega county. Look at the stadium Oparanya has built, it is the best in the country outside Nairobi. Look at the referral hospital that he is putting up, the roads and markets, the list is endless. On that score alone, Oparanya will floor Mudavadi in the nominations.
