Kisumu Woman Representative Rosa Buyu has launched the construction of Sh13 million market at Obambo trading centre in Kisumu West. The project is part of the National Government Affirmative Action Fund initiatives. This is the third market after Dunga in Kisumu Central and Akado in Seme. They are aimed at cushioning small-scale traders from the scorching sun typical of open air markets. Buyu said they strive to empower small traders through permanent structures that guarantee their safety and protection of their goods, and enhance trading hours. "Traders have been experiencing challenges from scorching sun to rains that affect their businesses. I want to assure you this will be a thing of the past with the construction of this market," she said during the groundbreaking ceremony. The market will be completed in three months. The lawmaker assured current traders that they will be prioritised during stalls allocation and warned that no intruder will be allowed to influence that. "Now that the market is being constructed, you will find some individuals coming up with lots of corruption, with some non-traders acquiring the stalls instead of the intended beneficiaries. This market will be yours; please, ensure the intended beneficiaries own it," she said. Traders will keep their goods in lockable cabinets so they are saved the burden of carrying them back home as they have been doing. "Do not worry about the safety of your goods. You will store them near you. You will easily lock them in cabinets," Buyu said. The market will also allow easy access for persons living with disabilities so no trader or customer is disadvantaged.Â The traders expressed their joy, saying they will no longer suffer open-space challenges. "Sometimes we would be rained on and we ended up making losses because our goods such as rice would be destroyed. We are happy about the permanent market project and we can't wait," Mary Onyango said.
