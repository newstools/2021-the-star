Kidundu Stadium in Vihiga county is set to host the second  leg of the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) league this weekend. The event has attracted hosts Vihiga county, Kenya Prisons, Equity Bank, KPA Nairobi Prison and AP Kenya. First leg took place at the Eldoret Main Prison in Uasin-Gishu county with vihiga and Nairobi Prisons winning their first two matches. Vihiga team head coach Samuel Mugata said they hope to pull good results despite  numerous challenges. He raised concern over the insufficient training equipment and lack of training ground. Mugata said they depend on the AP camp ground in Mbale to train but sometimes it is unavailable. “I still have hopes that my boys will make it despite the challenges we are facing,” he added. Vihiga won their Round One matches against Western Prisons and Nairobi Prisons last weekend before losing to Eldoret Prisons. Rift Valley Prisons coach Haron Chebii attributed their poor show top lack of experience on the big stage.  “We hope to get better with time,” Chebii said.
