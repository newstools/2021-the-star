Northern Suburbs will now proceed to the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU)  Championship play-offs after United States International University’s  Martials pulled out of the competition. USIU’s coach Tom Langat confirmed they wrote to KRU informing them that they  will not  feature in the competition. “We have not resumed normal teaching sessions so we can’t raise a team for the game until May when we resume fully,” Langat said. Suburbs coach Simon Jawichire regretted the decision by USIU to withdraw, saying they were ready to face them. The debutants are a game away from the top tier league and have now turned their focus on the semifinal fixture against former Kenya Cup side, Strathmore Leos. “We have been training for the game since October but now we have to turn our attention to the play-offs against Strathmore,” he said. Leos won the regular season unbeaten and are favourites to return to the top tier league. In the other quarter-final will be a battle between university sides Mean Machine and Egerton at the University of Nairobi grounds. Going into the game, Machine, the former Kenya Cup champions are favourites having won two previous encounters and drawn one. According to KRU, there will be strict adherence to Covid-19 containment measures and no fans will be allowed into the match venue. This year, there will be no final. Qualifier winners will proceed to Kenya Cup to replace Western Bulls and Kisumu RFC which were relegated from the top tier league last season.
