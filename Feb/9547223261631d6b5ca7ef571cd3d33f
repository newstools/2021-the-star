Imenti Central MP Kirima Moses has appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to extend the handshake between him and ODM leader Raila Odinga to his deputy, William Ruto. He said Ruto was left out in the handshake between the two. Citing recent Burma and Githurai chaos, Kirima said the country is headed in the wrong direction and warned politicians against divisive and tribal politics. Kirima said many people died during the fight for independence in the forests and the country is not ready for another bloodshed. He spoke on Sunday during the commissioning of the New Igane MCK church in Mwanganthia Ward, Central Imenti. The church was commissioned by Methodist Church presiding bishop Joseph Ntombura. Kirima also urged the clerics to intervene for the country to be peaceful before, during and after 2022 General Election. “I know you (Ntombura) are President Uhuru’s great friend and he recognises you very well. Tell Uhuru the country is on the blink of problems similar to what we experienced before and after election of 2007.This is serious and the same chaos and disunity we see today, happened in the year 2007-08,” he said. Kirima said politicians have devised new methods of inciting Kenyans against each other and bringing chaos. “As we speak today, President Uhuru has powers to call Raila and Ruto to a table to amicably resolve their differences for the good of this nation and avoid any bloodshed." "He (Uhuru) should sit with the two and request them to tone down politics instead of us looking and doing nothing when the nation is ended to the ashes,” the MP who is also a cleric said. Kirima said what Kenyans are demanding is development and not endless politicking. “We want peace. When you see a youth throwing stones to his fellow youth due to differences of political factions, anticipate injuries and deaths. I urge you (Ntombura) to talk to Uhuru to help curb divisions in the country,” he said.
