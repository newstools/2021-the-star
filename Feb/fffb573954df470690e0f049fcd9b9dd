Trans Nzoia County has passed the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020, becoming the second county to do so in Rift Valley. A total of 33 MCAs voted to pass the bill during a session chaired by speaker Joshua Werunga on Tuesday. Only two MCSs Evans Chesang of Chepchoina and Joshua Birir of Kiptoror ward voted against the bill while one abstained. Earlier, West Pokot passed the Bill, becoming the first in the Rift Valley region to do so. Six counties have so far passed the Bill. Others are Busia, Siaya, Kisumu and Homa Bay county assemblies. Only Baringo County has so far rejected the Bill during a chaotic session last week. Twenty-four out of 47 counties are required to pass the Bill. This now means that the BBI change proponents now need 18 counties for the Bill to make its way to Parliament and then a referendum.
