Ex-Ugandan rebel commander Dominic Ongwen has been convicted of war crimes at the International Criminal Court. Ongwen, a feared commander of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), is the first member of the LRA to appear before the court. He faced seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder and enslavement. The charges all relate to an attack on a camp for internally displaced people in Uganda in 2004. This case presented a dilemma to the court as he appeared to be both the victim and the alleged perpetrator. He said he was abducted by the LRA and forced to be a child soldier, before going on to rise up the ranks to become the deputy to LRA commander Joseph Kony. The ICC issued a warrant for his arrest in 2005 and US and African forces had been searching for him since 2011. In 2014 he gave himself up in the Central African Republic (CAR) and his three-and-a-half year trial in the Hague ended in March. His lawyers had asked for his acquittal and are quoted by Reuters news agency as saying in the closing argument "When Ongwen was abducted he had no option, he was made a slave. That slavery continued until he left the bush." But prosecutors reportedly insisted he was an adult at the time of the alleged offences so cannot be excused of responsibility.
