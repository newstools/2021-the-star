AC Milan coach Stefano Pioli said his side got what they deserved as they slipped to a surprise 2-0 defeat at Spezia in Serie A on Saturday, admitting his team are not capable of winning dirty. League leaders Milan did not have a shot on goal all match as they were outplayed by Spezia, the first time Pioli’s side failed to hit the target in a league game since August 2019. Milan, who were unbeaten in the league until early January, have lost three games in all competitions since that first loss to Juventus. Their lead is just two points over rivals Inter Milan, who play Lazio on Sunday, and Pioli feels his side have to find ways to grind out wins when not playing well. “We are not a team capable of winning dirty games,” Pioli told DAZN. “We have tried to focus on quality, intensity and rhythm and not on hard work. “Spezia won deservedly. It was a classic bad game for us. We have to start again with conviction. We must react and we certainly will.” Spezia, making their Serie A debut this season, were not overawed by the visit of Milan, and hit 17 shots compared to Milan’s seven in the 90 minutes. The result means Vincenzo Italiano’s side have now picked up 13 of their 24 points this season against teams in the top half in Serie A. “It was the best night of my career,” Italiano said. “Having faced a top class, amazing team like Milan, having made this performance and seen the boys play with this intensity, it gives us great satisfaction.”
