At no point has the Office of the Controller of Budget objected to the giving of car grants to MCAs. In a statement on Tuesday, Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakang'o said that since the grant has already been approved, there are processes that must be followed. "CoB disassociates itself from reports that the office has halted the implementation of car grants. This office affirms the separation of powers upon which the Constitution is anchored," she said. “... there are processes that must be followed to ensure that MCAs don't get into problems in terms of accounting for the grant,” she said. “We need to know that there are enough funds, just telling us it’s enough is not good enough. Secondly we would like to see some legislation that converts the loans into grant.” Two days ago, the Office of the Controller of Budget sought an advisory on how to implement the car grant for speakers and members of county assemblies. OCOB wrote to the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) to be advised how to convert a car loan facility into a car grant. It further sought to be told how to handle requests to authorise withdrawals from county revenue funds to finance the car grants. On 10 February, SRC approved the Sh4.5 billion car grant President Uhuru Kenyatta offered speakers and MCAs. SRC Chairperson Lyn Mengich reviewed car loan benefits to a transport facilitation benefit in form of a car grant. The commission further noted that the grant was payable to the county speakers and members of the county assembly.
