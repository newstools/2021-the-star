The Ministry of Health has announced an acute shortage of blood at the Lodwar County Referral Hospital. Turkana county director for medical services Gilchrist Lokoel decried the shortage at the hospital has been caused by a surge in Covid-19 cases. He said since the pandemic began, schools were closed to curb the spread of the virus and this has in turn seen them unable to get blood donations from students. Lokoel who spoke during a blood donation drive organised by Manchester United and Arsenals fans in Turkana, said the county has blood constraints. He appealed to the public to donate blood to save the lives of patients in need. “Before the pandemic began last year, we used to collect 300 pints of blood per month which was 30 per cent of our required amount but after the pandemic, it dropped to 100 pints of blood per month which is about 10 per cent,” he said. Health executive Jane Ajele urged the Health ministry to establish a blood-testing centre in the county to cut the cost of transportation to Eldoret. “I want to request CS Mutahi Kagwe to set up a blood-testing centre. We are forced to travel more than 400km from Lodwar to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Eldoret for blood testing. Why don’t we have a testing centre in Turkana yet we have capable officers who can undertake the process,” she asked. Edited by Sarah Kanyara
