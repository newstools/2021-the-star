Businesswoman Saumu Mbuvi, daughter of former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, announced on Tuesday she has broken up with Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip due to domestic violence. Saumu wrote about the incident on social media, saying he “nearly killed her”. "These are the things he did to me. He almost killed me. I will forever fight for women to stand for their rights. Never allow a man to be violent to you." Word Is reached out to the senator for comment, asking if indeed he had beaten her. “Yes, but only once, before I knew she is suffering from a mental problem,” he said. "She has a mental psychiatric problem called bipolar. That’s why we never stayed together. She breaks things, shouts and loses memory for even a week. “Imagine, and all the Kenyans and media houses don’t know. I always hide this from people." He added she did not get hospitalised from his beating, she was already sick. "Call her family members, mine, friends, hospital. Everyone knows she is sick. It’s just you media guys who don’t know, and we opted to hide to safeguard her name, but now she has turned her story to favour her.” Saumu confirmed she has bipolar on her Instagram stories, where she was interacting with fans. "I'm okay being bipolar, it's actually just a plus. Makes me super perfect, I don't entertain fakeness." Anwar claimed the problem had affected her past relationships.  “Even before we met, she had that problem, and that’s why all her boyfriends left her. So how can I beat her and we have been dating for barely two years then she gets sick?” Anwar then said he has reported the matter to DCI, where the case is being dealt with.
