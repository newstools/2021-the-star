KCB coach Japheth Munala and his Kenya Prisons counterpart Josp Barasa have welcomed the new changes by the Federation of International Volleyball relaxing restrictions against players during matches. Several playing rules have been changed and approved at the 37th FIVB World Congress with the aim of  spicing up the game. Teams are now allowed to substitute a player who has already been expelled or disqualified regardless of the number of substitutes already used. Initially, teams were only allowed to make a maximum of six substitutions and a seventh one  would be a relief to the teams. Munala said coaches now have the luxury of fielding one more player hence giving teams advantage. "It is a boost for the coaches in particular because they now can utilise the players at their disposal properly. These extra sub can be the game changer hence bring positive energy to the side," Munala said. Simultaneous contact by the blocker and attacker on the attacker's side of the net is now allowed. Initially, this was adjudged to be over-reaching but Barasa said teams will now defend and attack vigorously with freedom. "Over-reaching was a pain in the neck. As coaches, you are not sure whether the referee made the right call or not but players will now enjoy the game and worry about  nothing. If the congress approved the changes, who are we not to accept?," Barasa quipped. "It's an advantage to teams that boast of tall players when going for the blocks," Munala added. This time, a libero player can now be captain. A libero is  that player who serves as a defensive specialist. In another move, the ball can now be recovered by a player  over the entire scoring table. Initially, it was restricted to the half of the table that is on the side of the player's team. All changes that were approved will come into force on January 1, 2022.
