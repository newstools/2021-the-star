President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday arrived at Kabarak to celebrate the memorial service for the late President Daniel Moi. Uhuru was joined by the family, friends and relatives of Moi as they marked one year since his passing. The president was welcomed by Baringo senator Gideon Moi. After Moi's death, Uhuru issued a presidential proclamation announcing the passing on of the retired President. Moi died at the age of 95. A month before his death, doctors at the Nairobi Hospital were forced to put Moi back on life support machines. His health situation had not been stable since he was rushed to the facility in October 2019. Other politicians in attendance include ANC's Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetangula and Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka. Moi was buried on Feb 12, at his Kabarak home after a funeral service that was attended by thousands of morners.
