A Makueni medic has urged parents to allow their 10-year-old daughters to get the human papillomavirus vaccine to protect them against cervical cancer. Subcounty head of reproductive health and immunisation Joseph Mutinda on Thursday said the uptake of the vaccine in the subcounty has been low since the countrywide launch in 2019 and blamed the dismal performance on misconceptions about the vaccine. He assured parents that the vaccine is safe and urged them to ensure their young girls are not left out of the immunisation exercise. "The vaccine is very safe, allegations that it will make the girls infertile are unfounded, false and misleading," Mutinda said. He spoke to KNA in his office. He said cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women not only in Makueni but the entire country, hence the vaccine is aimed at reducing mortality. "Cervical cancer has one of the highest mortality rates in the country and it is for the reason that the government saw it important to roll out the vaccination of young girls," he added. Mutinda said the vaccine, taken in two doses within a span of six months, had been stocked in all health facilities across the county. "The young girls can be vaccinated either in schools or in our health facilities. The exercise is continuous and it's done among other routine immunisation drives," he said. Mutinda said the HPV vaccine drastically reduces one's chances of getting cervical cancer once they become sexually active, leading to a healthy population of women. He, however, underscored the need to create awareness to end resistance by parents and other key stakeholders.
