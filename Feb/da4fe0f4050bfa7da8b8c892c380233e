All cases challenging the vetting, appointment, swearing in and assumption of office of Ann Kananu Mwenda as acting Nairobi governor will now be handled by a bench of three Judges. Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu appointed justices Said Chitembwe, Weldon Korir and Wilfrida Okwany to hear the matters. The cases, ten in number, will be mentioned on 25 of this month at noon before the said bench. In January this year, Justice Anthony Murima consolidated all ten cases in respect to Kananu. Murima said the matters will be heard together to save judicial time and accord each party an opportunity to be heard. “In order to foster an orderly conduct of all these related matters and given the limited judicial time coupled with the need to accord each party an opportunity to be heard, I am of the position that all these matters be consolidated,” Murima said. Some of the petitions were filed by Activist Okiya Omtatah, Law Society of Kenya, Thirdway Alliance, Anne Kananu herself and others. It is in the LSK matter that an order was issued stopping the swearing-in of Kananu as substantive governor. A directive was also issued that the matter be heard by a bench to be constituted by Mwilu. The office of Nairobi Governor became vacant after Mike Sonko was impeached. Edited by Henry Makori
