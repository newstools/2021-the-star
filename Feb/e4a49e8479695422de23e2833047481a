Homa Bay county commissioner Moses Lilan has praised the Covid-19 disaster response team for their efforts in tackling the coronavirus. Lilan said on Wednesday that the team’s work had ensured the county was among the areas with the lowest number of cases. Speaking in Homa Bay town during a meeting with heads of security teams, Lilan said only 300 cases had been reported. Fewer than 10 have died with Covid-19 since March last year. He attributed this to the tireless efforts of security officers in the area and strategies put in place to ensure minimal spread of the virus. Lilan further complimented the officers for ensuring the residents adhered to the Covid-19 regulations. “It is not that the residents are immune to Covid-19 but about the strategies we put in place to ensure our people are not exposed to this virus,” Lilan said. He said they had challenges during the festive season in ensuring the Covid-19 regulations are followed but still managed to control the situation. The administrator urged the officers to be vigilant to ensure any incident of insecurity is stamped out. He also told them to be on the lookout for people who are still convening large public gatherings against health protocols. At the same time, he said they are working closely with school heads to foil unrest. He warned that students found responsible for unrest will be held accountable for their actions.
