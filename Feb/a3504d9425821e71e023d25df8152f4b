The national government will allocate Sh150 million for the upgrading of Gusii Stadium to international status, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced on Monday. The President said he has directed Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed to release the money to Kisii County to renovate the stadium. President Kenyatta spoke at Gusii Stadium during the burial service of former cabinet minister Simeon Nyachae. He announced that following consultations with the national government, the stadium will be renamed after Nyachae. It was established by Nyachae’s father the late Musa Nyandusi. “This facility will now be known as Simeon Nyachae. The upgrading should be done before the end of the year,” said President Kenyatta. The President also announced that a sports talent academy will be established at Nyanturago Stadium. This will be named Nyantika Maiyoro Sports Talent Academy. Nyachae used to host an annual cultural and sports festival at Nyanturago. “The academy will help our youths horn their skills in various sports. The academy should be completed before I go home next year,” added President Uhuru. Athletics Kenya Nyanza South chairman Peter Angwenyi thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for allocating the funds to upgrade the stadium. “I want to take this opportunity to thank the president for honouring Nyachae in a very special way. Having the stadium renamed after Nyachae and having a sports talent academy at Nyanturago is the best way to honour Nyachae,” Angwenyi said. “Nyachae was a keen sportsman who held a triple jump record in Nyanza for 12 years. He was also a sprinter during his heydays at Kisii School."
