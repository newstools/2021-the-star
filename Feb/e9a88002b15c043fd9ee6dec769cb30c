NCBA Bank has partnered with Shelter Afrique to provide mortgage finance to buyers in five counties. Under the agreement, NCBA will offer mortgage finance to over 200 housing units developed by Shelter Afrique and spread across Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Kiambu and Machakos counties. The developments include maisonettes and apartments ranging from Sh5.5 million to Sh20.25 million. NCBA’s head of Property finance Stella Mutai said the bank will continue to seek partnerships in order to improve access to housing within the country and the region. He added that the huge volume of houses that the country needs will require closer partnerships to help meet the growing housing needs in major cities and towns. Shelter Afrique’s Group MD Andrew Chimphondah said the strategic focus is on, rapidly closing the housing deficits that are prevalent across Africa. ''This cannot be accomplished by one institution, it requires a shared vision and goal. NCBA has proven to be a reliable partner in addressing the housing shortage in Kenya,'' Chimphondah said. Shelter Afrique is a wholesale market maker both on the supply and demand sides of the housing sector. Its primary interventions are the financing of large-scale affordable housing projects on the continent and the supply of long-term finance for mortgages. Through this partnership, NCBA will provide customers with discounted mortgage products to cover the cost of that house. The lender did not reveal the interest rate. The bank has signed partnerships with quantity surveyors, valuers, furniture shops, house fittings among others. It recently partnered with Optiven Group to offer its customers an opportunity to buy their desired plot of land simultaneously, with the opportunity to pay up to 25 years. The bank has also partnered with  Tilisi Developments who are putting up more than 300 homes on the 400-acre mixed-use facility in Limuru.
