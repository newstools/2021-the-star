The return of playmaker Lawrence Juma from suspension will be a major boost for Sofapaka's midfield as they welcome Zoo Kericho in a rescheduled Football Kenya Federation Premier League match at Moi Stadium, Kasarani this afternoon. The 2009 Kenyan Premier League champions lie 10th on the log with 11 points from nine matches and a win over the visitors could earn them enough points to climb one spot up. Although they will be without the services of their erstwhile midfielder Elly Asieche, who ditched them for moneybags Wazito a fortnight ago, Sofapaka should expect some fireworks from former Napsa marksman Timothy Otieno. Batoto ba Mungu, however, know just too well that their encounter with the Kericho-based lads won't be a walk in the park given. Zoo, who currently languish at the tail end of the table after managing just two points from seven matches, will be fighting tooth and nail to jump out of the relegation zone. Sofapaka go into the match as favourites, having won six out of their eight previous encounters against Zoo and sharing spoils in the remaining two. In the last three matches each of the teams have played, Sofapaka have managed a win, a draw and a loss with Zoo losing all. On Thursday, Tusker will seek to open the gap on high-riding fellow title contenders KCB when they lock horns with Posta Rangers. This could turn out to be one of the toughest battles for the mailmen this season, considering they are seemingly low on confidence after a series of disappointing results. The brewers sit pretty at the summit of the top tier on 26 points, one above KCB, who have been on the rampage since the beginning of the season, falling only once in their match against AFC Leopards at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Kariobangi Sharks will be eyeing their sixth win of the season when they clash with Vihiga United at Mumias Complex on Thursday.
