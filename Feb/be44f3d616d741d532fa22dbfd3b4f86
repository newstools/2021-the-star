Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi 's father's burial service was disrupted on Monday after a fist fight broke out between MPs Silvanus Osoro (South Mugirango) and Dagoreti North's Simba Arati over BBI. Osoro, an ally of Deputy President William Ruto, had left the podium after telling off ODM leader Raila Odinga over his push for BBI when Arati went on the stage and told off the DP off over his continued rejection of the document. Hardly had he spoken when Osoro went back to the podium, held Arati by the collar and they exchanged harsh words before they were separated. Police and enforcement officers hadÂ  to intervene and whisk away some elements near the podium. Tension continued to mount as speaker after another took to the stage. Nominated Senator Millicent Omanga was also forced off the podium as she tried to grab the microphone from Governor James Ongwae. Maangi's father, Abel Gongera, died a fortnight ago. Ruto and Raila arrived for the burial about a half hour apart to a rousing welcome by jubilant supporters. The arrival of the ODM party leader caused momentary disruption of the church service which had already begun. He was ushered in by boda boda riders as he was led to the service tent at Tendere Primary School. Maangi , the sixth born in a family of eight, paid a glowing tribute to his father, describing him as peace loving and one who loved all. In a short speech, Maangi, a Ruto supporter, remained unapologetic for breaking away from ODM to work with Tangatanga. He said there was nothing wrong with politicians uniting for the sake of the country. "When you (Raila) decided to work with Uhuru, the country realised peace. If today you decide to work with Ruto, there would be nothing wrong," said Maangi. Former South Mugirango MP Omingo Magara, the PDP party leader, openly denounced his support for ODM in favour of Ruto. He said he found the Ruto a better choice to work with. Other MPs in attendance were Shadrack Mose and Joash Nyamoko.
