The National Assembly has suffered a blow after a five-judge bench declined to recuse itself from a case in which retired CJ David Maraga had advised the President to dissolve Parliament. The National Assembly had made an application to the judges to recuse themselves because they were appointed by DCJ Philomena Mwilu. They claimed that the deputy CJ cannot exercise powers conferred on the Chief justice under the law. "Our finding is that under the Constitution, the deputy CJ is the person who has authority to undertake the functions of the Chief Justice in his absence or when the he is unable to act,” the court ruled on Thursday. However, the bench presided by Justice Lydia Achode ruled that the DCJ was right to appoint the bench on behalf of the then CJ who was conflicted in the matter. The other judges in the case are Justices George Odunga, James Makau, Anthony Ndungu and Pauline Nyamweya. The bench further noted that the reason Maraga assigned his deputy to appoint the judges is to avoid the issue of bias because he had also been sued in the petition. They noted that some of the petitioners in the case had written to the CJ accusing him of bias in empaneling the bench, which is why he decided to assign the duty to Mwilu “It is evident that the CJ could not in the interest of justice, rule of law and integrity assign judges to hear and determine cases challenging the advice he had personally given to the president,” they ruled. They argued that in the circumstances, it was prudent that another person performs that function.
