Delays by the National Treasury in disbursing funds to constituencies is to blame for stalled projects started by their offices, Imenti South MP Kathuri Murungi has said. Kathuri said it is also difficult for the constituency to proceed with development projects initiated in a previous financial year when cash is delayed. “We have a challenge of funds disbursement to the constituency because only Sh9 million was received so far since June 2020. I hope the national government is generating enough revenue to disburse the NG-CDF money soonest,” Karthuri said Tuesday. Kathuri said most affected projects are the construction of classrooms to decongest schools and roads upgrading. The MP said some road tarmacking projects have stalled after broke contractors who won tenders, started projects and abandoned them before completion. He said such contractors' contracts must be terminated and new ones awarded the jobs. “They have no capacity. We are considering to award Chinese contractors to finish the job,” Kathuri said. Kathuri also criticised Transport CS James Macharia for allegedly concentrating on Mau Mau road projects in Central Kenya counties while leaving out Meru. “We have seen Mau Mau road construction in Nyandarua, Kiambu, Nyeri and other Central counties. Why have impassable Mau Mau roads in Meru? Why are they not in the government's priority for construction?” he asked. The MP urged the youth, women and people living with disability to apply for tenders floated by the CDF and committed that they will get the jobs. Kathuri urged residents to support the Building Bridges Initiative, saying extra resources will trickle down to the people and stalled projects completed faster. "Be supporters of BBI. I will close my eye against some clauses that are not friendly to get a constituency. We are losing a lot of opportunities on KDF, police, teachers and other recruitment due to a huge population of more than 210,000 people,” Kathuri said.
