The Kenya Wildlife Service has collared a leopard captured early this month and moved it to Tsavo. Nguruman, a famous and loved cat, was trapped by a KWS team at the southern side of the park on February 1. He was suspected to be causing trouble around the Nairobi National Park. The leopard was trapped at Naretunoi conservancy where he was in a holding facility, according to KWS. His new home will now be the northern part of Tsavo East. Earlier, conservationists had raised the alarm that the cat was in a cage and complained that he was injured, stressed and suffering. They had demanded his release. "He has not yet been released. It is said that the authorities are waiting for a collar to put on Nguruman. My thoughts: Athi, Lewa, and other lions with collars have been murdered outside the park, on the south side, so what will this help? " a conservationist said. The nature lover questioned the rationale of having the conservancy if the cats cannot be allowed to roam freely. But KWS denied the claims, saying there was no cause for alarm. KWS head of veterinary Services David Ndeereh said the relocation zone was good for the leopard as it had a wide area. The officer said the leopard was being quarantined and screened to ensure it was free of disease.Â Nguruman would then be collared for monitoring, so he does not cause trouble, he said.
