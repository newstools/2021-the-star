Comedian Terence Creative says he is always body-shamed on social media. "I experience this every day," he wrote on Instagram. "I see people insult us coz of our size and wonder what makes them happy. I realise I am not the problem, they are." Terence was defending State House spokesperson Kanze Dena for being body-shamed on Twitter on her return to the public eye months after she reportedly gave birth. The comments were mostly about her physical appearance, with most Kenyans online speaking unfavourably about her apparent weight gain. Other media personalities who spoke against body shamers include Emmy Kosgei, who termed body shaming uncouth. "Please be kind on social media, do not be a reason for someone's tears." Singer Wahu said it was unfortunate to see women speaking badly against another woman who has just given birth. "We can do better guysâ€¦ let's be better."
