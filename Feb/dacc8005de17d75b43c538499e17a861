Homabay BBI coordinator Agutu Jakorayo, has congratulated the county Assembly for passing the BBI bill. Homa Bay County Assembly was the third assembly to pass the Building Bridges Initiative Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020 after Siaya and Kisumu. MCAs unanimously passed the bill which was tabled before the house by Justice and Legal Affairs committee chairman Ajimba Ayieta and seconded by nominated MCA Kevin Onyango. "As the coordinating team, we want to assure the public that we shall work very closely with the county and national leadership for a resounding success at the ballot for the referendum," Jakorayo said. In a statement on Friday, Jakorayo said Kenya stands to gain after the referendum, since devolution shall be properly 'anchored and facilitated'. "I wish to assure Homa bay county leadership that we shall be number one at the referendum!" he added. Baringo County Assembly became the first to reject the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill after a chaotic session on Thursday. Just before the Speaker declared the results where 30 MCAs rejected the Bill in comparison to 11 who voted yes, teargas was thrown into the chamber. The Speaker braved the chaos to announce the results and adjourned the sitting. The Constitution requires that at least half of the 47 assemblies - 24 - need to approve a constitutional amendment bill for a referendum to pass, regardless of the verdict in Parliament. After the assemblies' anticipated approval, the Secretariat will ask speakers of the assembles to certify passage to the two speakers of Parliament. The BBI law change promises additional key positions at the helm of the Executive. The prime minister, two deputy prime ministers and leader of official opposition as some of the sweeteners for the bigwigs who stand to gain if BBI is passed.
