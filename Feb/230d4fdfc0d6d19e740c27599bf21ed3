Murang'a Senator Irungu Kangata has officially vacated the office of the Senate Majority Chief Whip. This is after Speaker Kenneth Lusaka communicated changes to the office following receipt of official communication from Deputy Majority Whip Farhiya Haji on the changes. The speaker said he received a list of Jubilee members who attended the PG meeting held at KICC on Tuesday. He also received a list of members who signed for Kangata's removal. " I am satisfied that the change was made in accordance with Standing Order 195 and meets the threshold required," Lusaka said in the communication to the house on Wednesday afternoon. " I wish to communicate to the House that the majority party has effected changes in the office of Senate majority whip which shall now take effect. The officeholder is now senator Kimani Wamatangi," he said. Kangata was removed from the position during a PG meeting chaired by Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju on Tuesday. Tuju said the Murang'a senator was axed from the position for questionable loyalty, lack of decorum, and breach of confidentiality.
