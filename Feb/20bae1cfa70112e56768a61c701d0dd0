Equity Bank head coach David Maina believes his charges have no excuse not to challenge for the Kenya Basketball Federation Premier League title this year. The bankers recruited heavily with shooting forward Faheem Juma, Shem Otieno, Crispin Abuto, Joseph Ongoro, Fredrick Onono and Davis Siaji joining the side. The combination  of sharp shooting Juma and Ongoro should propel the bankers to great success once the team's chemistry improves. They begin their assault with a grudge fixture against Emyba at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium on Saturday. Maina has not forgotten it was surprise package Emyba who eliminated them from the 2019 play-offs quarter finals and will be undoubtedly going for revenge. The other match on card in the city is the women's fixture pitting University of Nairobi Dynamites against Zetech Sparks. Coach Maurice Obilo is also hopeful national team playmaker Debbie Obunga and Christine Akinyi will lead Sparks to glory. At the Makande Welfare Hall in  Mombasa,  Kenya Ports Authority men's team will encounter Kenyatta University Pirates whereas their women counterparts lock horns with Oryx. It will be a baptism of fire for Pirates, who are making a return to the top tier,  an opener that coach Gitau Waringo had not hoped for. KPA women have been in strict training ahead of next month's Africa Championship and should easily dispatch the students. The quartet of Hilda Indasi, Brenda Angechi, Taudenciah Peter and Rita Aluoch will provide enough firepower for KPA at both fronts.
