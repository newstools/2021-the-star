The Busia government has allocated Sh120 million for the acquisition of two modern fire engines. This is contained in the Budget and Appropriation Committee Report on the Annual Development Plan for 2021-22. The report was adopted by the county assembly on Thursday without amendment. Disaster management acting director Joseph Osere said one fire engine will cover Funyula, Bunyala and parts of Butula subcounties. The other will serve Matayos, Nambale and parts of Butula. The report, tabled by Angurai South MCA Grace Olita and seconded by Majority leader Ekesa Kassaman, was put to a vote on Wednesday afternoon. However, Nambale Township MCA Mwajuma Toloi raised objections, demanding an increase in allocation for ward-based projects from Sh20 million to Sh25 million per ward. Speaker Bernard Wamalwa deferred the question to Thursday afternoon on the condition that the budget committee members append their signatures on the increase.
