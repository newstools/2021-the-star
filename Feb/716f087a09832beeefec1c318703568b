Vihiga United coach Sammy Okoth says he is pressed for time to conduct trials during the ongoing second player transfer window. Okoth made the remarks during the team's training session at Senende grounds on Wednesday. “Trials need time considering the high number of players expected to show up.” Okoth said he will simply identify and handpick players according to the needs of the club, although he did not reveal his targets. “You see if I give out the names, other clubs might go for them before finalising the deal,” he said. He, however, said there was an urgent need to sharpen the striking force by acquiring a clinical finisher upfront. Okoth said lack of a good striker explains  their slim wins and barren draws. “We also need to tighten our midfield and defence as well so that when we have the goal poacher, we are also secured on our side as well,” Okoth cited. “The current squad are on their peak compared to the previous one,” he said. Okoth observed that their win over Gor Mahia and the draw against Sofapaka was a clear indicator that the team's curve was on the rise. However,  the coach urged Vihiga United fans to stand by their team for good results. He cautioned fans against tormenting the players on social media over poor results because such incidents only served to demoralise them in the long run. Vihiga are currently 12th on the FKF-PL log.
