As the world marks the National Cancer Prevention Month this February, the power of strict adherence to diet can hardly be underestimated. The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 30 per cent of all cancers are as a result of poor dietary habits. At least 70 per cent of these cancers are related to the gastrointestinal tract. “Most cancers are related to excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol consumption or poor nutrition,” says Taita Taveta county nutritionist Pauline Mugo. She recommends the public to have a healthy diet to reduce the risk of cancer that has proved to be a global socioeconomic burden. "Higher intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain foods plays a significant role in reducing the risks of death and cancer. Reduced intake of salt, red and processed meat is also key to preventing cancer," Mugo said. She said healthy dietary habits and routines are vital to warding off chronic diseases, including cancer. “Consume a healthy diet with an emphasis on plant foods. Probiotics, selenium, Vitamin D, Omega-3 and folic acid also help in reducing chances of developing cancer due to dietary factors,” she said. Dr Rebecca Mwakichako, an oncologist, says the main nutrients to focus on during cancer treatment are protein, carbohydrates, fats, water, vitamins and minerals. She says proteins are necessary to support muscle strengthening and maintenance for resisting infections, while water helps to replenish cellular health.
