Telkom Kenya has partnered with phone vendors to offer mobile phones at accessible price points as the perfect Valentine’s Day gift for the rural and urban youth customer. The mobile phones come bundled with data offers to complement their access to the Internet and their mobile lifestyles. In a statement on Monday, Telkom said with affordable unlimited calling, texting and data plans, it will give most connected customers options that take advantage of a variety of devices. This will be in partnership with Huawei, Infinix, Xiaomi and Tecno brands, competitively priced Internet-enabled devices ranging between Sh13,000- Sh30,000 – in the month-long promotion. Telkom’s Managing Director for Consumer Steve Okeyo said Telkom’s Valentine’s promotion makes it easier for anyone to get select smartphones at a competitive price and keep connected. “The promotion marks our latest effort to make it easier and more affordable for people to join the data revolution and step up to 4G, enabling them to stay connected with their loved ones not only through voice calls but also photos, texts, social media updates and more," he said. Mid-last year, Telkom unveiled its new strategic focus areas that will address the current transformational dynamic as well as Telkom’s long-term objectives, as it works towards becoming the technology company of the future.
