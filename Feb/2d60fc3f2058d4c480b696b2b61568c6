Kiambu MPs have urged the Treasury to release the National Government Constituency Development Fund for the development of the education sector. Gatundu North MP Wanjiku Kibe said most of the NG-CDF cash funds education. “We are being pushed by our constituents, but we have not received money this year,” Wanjiku said in Kiambu town on Thursday. Kiambu MP Jude Njomo said NG-CDF has gone a long way in funding education programmes in the constituency. He said several Kiambu schools that were dilapidated have been rehabilitated using NG-CDF. New ones have also been constructed. “With money coming closer to the people, development is realised,” Njomo said. He spoke during the handover of ACK Kiuu River Secondary School. The school was constructed using NG-CDF at a cost of Sh28 million. Education CS George Magoha was the chief guest. NG-CDF board chairman Robert Masese said most of the money goes towards building classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, halls, buying school buses and bursaries. “Seventy per cent of constituencies’ allocations to a tune of Sh137 million goes towards funding education. Nationally it translates to Sh28 billion," Masese said. Masese said urged the Ministry of Education to come up with a coordinated mechanism to avoid duplication of applications of bursaries.
