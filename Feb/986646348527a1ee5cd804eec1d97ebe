The Covid-19 pandemic saw almost 1000 people in Kenyan exit the dollar millionaire club last year as key investment portfolios stagnated or crushed. However with things picking up, an estimated 1,517 Kenyans are expected to join the dollar millionaire club by 2025. The 2021 Knight Frank’s Wealth Report released Wednesday shows that the number of people worth over $1 million (Sh100 million) which dropped to 3,323 in 2020 from 4,235 the previous year is expected to rise to 4,840 in 2025. The Knight Frank Wealth Sizing Model shows that Kenya’s population of High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs) – those worth over one million US dollars - slipped by 22 per cent last year, compared with a global decline of just eight per cent "Even so, our wealth sizing model predicts that over the next five years Kenya’s High-Net-Worth individuals (HNW) population will bounce back by 46 per cent,’’ Andrew Shirley, editor of The Wealth Report at Knight Frank said. At least 20 more Kenyans are also expected to join the  elite group of super-wealthy persons known as Ultra High Net-Worth Individuals (UHNWI) with a net worth of more than Sh3 billion, pushing the number to 110. Although the report does not give names of some of the billionaires in the country, Forbes listed individuals including travel investor, Baloobhai Patel, logistics guru Peter Muthoka, banking and investment titan Peter Munga and Jimnah Mbaru as multi millionaires in its latest series. Others in the billionaire club are hotelier and car dealer Abdul Karim Popat, media mogul Samuel Kamau Macharia, food processing investor Pius Ngugi, Kiprop Bundotich commonly refered to as Buzeki and Retail investor Paul Wanderi. It listed steel tycoon Narendra Raval, as one of Kenya’s most successful entrepreneurs worth over $650 million. Coronavirus pandemic saw 16 individuals dropped from the super-rich status, leaving the country with only 90 such people compared to 106 the previous year. Globally, the number of dollar millionaires dropped to 48.5 million from 52.9 million in 2019. This number is however, projected to increase to 68.1 million. In Africa, the number of dollar millionaires shrunk to 231,309 in 2020 compared to 251,511 the previous year. While the number of dollar millionaires dropped, more people seemed to take advantage social economic opportunities brought about by the the virus, including internet, sanitizers and Covid-19 protective gears to enter the ultra rich list. In the continent, the number of those worth over Sh3 billion rose by  five per cent to 3,270 from 3,127 in 2019. This number is expected to rise by 33 per cent to 4,361 in 2025. The number of super rich individuals defied the Covid -19 to grow  marginally by two per cent to  521,653 compared to 509,252 in 2019. This figure is however, expected to grow to 290,079 by 2025. The shift is coming in a year of relatively hard economic times in the country, which has resulted in a drop in corporate profits that has seen thousands of people lose their jobs and cut dividends from firms owned by the wealthy. According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), at least two million lost jobs last year, doubling the country’s unemployment rate to 10.2 per cent. According to the report, the top five popular sectors that Kenyan UHNWIs are becoming more interested in and directing investments towards are: Retirement and Development land (38%), Residential private rented sector (PRS) (33%), Agricultural (29%), Healthcare & Retail (25%) and Offices (21%). Wealth advisers who participated in the survey  stated that their Kenyan clients allocated their property investment portfolio in the following property types: Residential private rented sector (PRS) (22%), Retail (17%), Offices (14%) and Retirement (13%). According to Ben Woodhams, MD Knight Frank Kenya, even though 2020 caused upheaval for most businesses and investors, there is renewed optimism in 2021. ''As travel restrictions reduce and the rollout plans of the vaccination programs reaches an advanced stage, private capital will look to increase exposure back to the market and focus on sectors with a strong long-term outlook,''Woodhams said.
