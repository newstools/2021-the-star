The government has extended the deadline to phase out old passports to December 2021. Interior CS Fred Matiang’i said phasing out the old-generation passports as part of the binding commitment made to migrate to the new East African Community biometric e-passport. However, he said, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Directorate of Immigration Services scaled down its operations in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. “Barring any unforeseen circumstances, this is the last extension, and Kenyans are advised to make the necessary arrangements and acquire the electronic passports at the earliest opportunity possible to avoid travelling inconveniences,” he said. He added for the avoidance of doubt, starting January 1, 2022, the old dark blue passport will be null and void. “Kenyan will be able to travel internationally without a valid East African Community biometric e-passport.” The process has been ongoing for the last two years and so far more than half Kenyans who have passports have migrated to the new electronic ones
