Nigerian singer Joeboy has released a new single, 'Focus', off his latest studio album, 'Something between beauty and magic', which was released early this month. Speaking about the album, Joeboy said, "It has always been my resolve to spread good vibes through music and put a smile on people's faces." He defined happiness as looking into your lover's eyes, a child's smile, laughter, the memory of the first kiss or marriage to the one you love. "I hope anyone who gets to listen to it will experience the vibes and share it with others." The album has 14 tracks and a bonus documentary and is a collaboration of various producers on each song. Joeboy is the first successful artiste to participate in Empawa Africa, the talent incubator and mentorship programme founded by Afropop superstar, Mr Eazi.
