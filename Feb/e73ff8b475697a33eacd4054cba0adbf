Estates and roads have been left inaccessible after the Saturday day night rain. The rains which begun at night until Sunday morning have left residents wondering how they will be able to leave their houses. Pictures obtained by the Star shows that estates in Syokimau and it's environs have been flooded with vehicles submerged. The rains which have been witnessed since the beginning of the month, have left many areas wet and highly inaccessible. Along Mombasa road, the roads have been flooded with motorists having a rough time in driving carefully. The weatherman had said Nairobi, most of Central Kenya and Rift Valley highlands will have a dull weekend that will be cloudy and rainy. But noted that sunny weather will resume on Monday. Stella Aura, the Met director, said next week will be mostly sunny throughout the country except in Western Kenya and Rift Valley highlands. "Rainfall is expected to continue over the highlands east of the Rift Valley (including Nairobi county), the Lake Victoria basin, the highlands west of the Rift Valley, the central and south Rift Valley and the south-eastern lowlands at the beginning of the forecast period," she said in a five-day forecast that lapses on Tuesday. "Most parts of the country are expected to be generally dry during the second half of the forecast period," she said. The rains spread across the country beginning last weekend, mostly driven by the wet weather in Tanzania.
