The High Court has suspended all resolutions and decisions that were made at the impugned LSK Special General Meeting last month. In his ruling on Wednesday, Justice Weldon Korir further ruled that the implementation of the resolutions shall cease forthwith and all activities arising from them are suspended. In the case, Lawyer Adrian Kamotho had moved to court seeking to stop the implementation of the resolutions made at the SGM. On Tuesday, Justice Alfred Mabea had allowed LSK to withdraw Sh19.6 Million from their accounts with two signatories instead of the required three. The ruling by Justice Korir reinstates Roseline Odede and Benard Ngetich as signatories. President Nelson Havi had argued the two council members were no longer signatories. Odede resigned and Ngetich was suspended during the chaotic Special General Meeting that was held last month, leaving only two signatories. Those who had also been suspended were Ngetich, Aluso Ingati, Carolyne Mutheu, Faith Odhiambo, Linda Emukule, Beth Michoma, Ndinda Kinyili and George Omwanza.
