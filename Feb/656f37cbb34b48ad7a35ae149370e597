Karen MCA David Mberia was on Thursday sentenced to serve three years in jail for requesting and receiving a bribe of Sh1.7million bribe from a private school. Mberia was given an alternative fine of Sh700,000 to secure his release. Milimani chief Magistrate Thomas Nzyoki has also barred him from holding public office as an MCA. "The accused is barred from holding public office and accessing his office. This order is directed to be transferred to speaker county Assembly for the record," the magistrate ruled. In the first count of requesting a Sh1 million bribe, Mberia will pay Sh300,000 or serve 12 months in default. In the second count Mberia requested a Sh500, 000 bribe , he will serve 12 months in jail or pay Sh200, 000. In the third count of receiving treated money of Sh200, 000, the court ordered him to pay a fine of Sh200, 000 or serve 12 months in jail. The terms will be served consecutively. This means if Mberia does not raise Sh700, 000 fine, he will serve three years in prison. The court observed that the he is first offender and a leader.
