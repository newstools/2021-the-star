Former powerful Cabinet minister Simeon Nyachae will be laid to rest at a private ceremony on February 15, 2021, at his home in Nyosia Village, Kisii County, his family has announced. According to his son Charles Nyachae, a funeral service will be held on the same day starting at 9 am at Nyanturago Stadium, Nyaribari Chache, Kisii County. "For family and friends in Nairobi, service will be held on February 11th at Nairobi Central SDA Church- Maxwell starting at 10 am," a statement from the family read. Nyachae passed away on Monday at Nairobi Hospital aged 88 years. "He has rested after a fairly long illness. We want to thank and appreciate Mzee's life and what he has been able to do," his son and former CIC chairman, Charles Nyachae, said. Addressing the media on Monday, Charles thanked the hospital for the care they gave his father. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday joined leaders in mourning Nyachae. In a statement released from the Sagana State Lodge on Monday, the President said Nyachae's successful transition from public service to the world of business and politics was a demonstration that focus and hard work pay. Uhuru said his death has robbed Kenya of a wise statesman whose long service to the nation helped shape the country's standing as one of Africa's most progressive economies. Last month, there were rumours that the former minister had passed away which his son, Charles Nyachae, dismissed.
