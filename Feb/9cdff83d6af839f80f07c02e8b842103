The High Court on Tuesday ordered Standard Chartered Bank to allow LSK to withdraw money from its accounts using two signatories. However, Justice Alfred Mabea gave the bank a specific figure to give to LSK immediately pending replacement of the other signatories who left the council. “The expenses are lawful and allow the application as follows, the bank accepts cheques signed by the two signatories,” the judge ruled. The total amount to be withdrawn shall be capped at Sh14 million for January and February salaries, Sh980,000 for audit, Sh1.2 million for forensic audit and Sh3.5 million for their upcoming elections. Justice Mabea further directed the bank that there will be no more withdrawal until the council is in place. In the case, LSK President Nelson Havi moved to court saying the association is in disarray because they cannot withdraw money without a third signature. LSK Vice President Caroline Kamende, CEO Mercy Wambua and Council Members Roseline Odede and Bernard Ngetich are the signatories. Odede resigned and Ngetich was suspended during the chaotic Special General Meeting that was held last month, leaving only two signatories.
