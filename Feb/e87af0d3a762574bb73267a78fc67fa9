President Uhuru Kenyatta has reiterated his commitment to fulfil his election pledges before the end of his tenure in 2022. Key among them is the expansion of electricity connectivity, opening up of more roads and accelerating the growth of small businesses. "We want to ensure that every Kenyan has access to electricity both for domestic and for income generating activities such as welding, hairdressing businesses and milk cooling plants for farmers," the President said. He spoke on Monday evening at Kimahuri in Kieni East, Nyeri County where he commissioned a last mile electricity connectivity project expected to benefit 216 households and several public institutions including schools, markets and health centres. He said over 70 percent of homes in Kenya were connected to the national grid compared to only that 30 percent that had electricity when he took over the nation's leadership in 2013. In November last year, Uhuru laid out key projects and initiatives that will form part of his legacy, when he exits office. Atop his legacy planks is passage of the Building Bridges Initiative report, which is currently being processed for a referendum. Addressing area residents shortly after switching on electricity in Mama Lydia Njeri Kahuthu's house, the Head of State announced Government plans to tarmac the Sagana-Ndathi-Naromoru Road, set up a milk cooling facility, and a hospital in the area. "This road will ease the transportation of goods in this area. It will particularly help farmers to access markets for their produce beyond the region,‚ÄùUhuru said. The President, who is on a working visit in Central Kenya, restated his call for national unity saying that is the only way to ensure the current development momentum is not lost. On BBI, Uhuru rallied area residents to support the law reform process saying its proposals will ensure sufficient resources go to the counties to benefit wananchi.
