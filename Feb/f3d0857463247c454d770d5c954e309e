Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital and Moi University have signed a fresh five-year collaboration MoU focusing on improved healthcare, training and research. Hospital CEO Dr Wilson Aruasa and varsity vice chancellor Professor Isaac Kosgey signed the MoU on Friday in Eldoret. “Our objectives include delivery of high-quality specialised healthcare, training, research and national health policy planning among other areas," Dr Aruasa said. The Moi University School of Medicine is based at the hospital for training doctors and the two institutions have for many years been working together on training, research and medical services. “As Moi University we are very excited to have this MoU with MTRH covering training, research and community service among other areas,"  Kosgey said. The MoU will also facilitate handling problems arising because members of the academic staff at Moi University bear responsibility for teaching, research and consultancy - and providing clinical services. The MoU also recognises clinical staff at MTRH are responsible for clinical services as well as teaching and research. Dr Aruasa and Professor Kosgey said the MoU provides mechanisms to help eliminate misunderstanding, disharmony, disputes and conflict. The MoU covers collaboration of management of clinical departments, student matters and disciplinary issues for staff and students. It will be implemented through departments, directorates and the MoU Implementation Committee. (Edited by V, Graham)
