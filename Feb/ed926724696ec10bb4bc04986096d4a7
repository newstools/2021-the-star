President Uhuru Kenyatta has warned the public against voting in leaders who will destroy the country. “The arrogance that we see in today’s leadership raises many questions as to the future of this country and I will plead to my fellow leaders that there is no person bigger than the other,” he said. He said there were people who had built Kenya with sweat and blood and urged those seeking power to do so with respect. Speaking in Swahili at former President Daniel Moi Memorial Service in Kabarak on Thursday, Uhuru warned the electorate against voting in “a demolition squad". "Wenzangu, tusiteleze tulete demolition squad badala ya wajenzi," he said.  (Let us not slide into demolition squad instead of builders) Uhuru narrated Kenya’s history from the colonial times to the current regime saying all the past leaders had played their role in building the country with humility and respect to all. “My colleagues, you will have leadership, no problem. But please, seek peace with your colleagues. Let us respect each other," he said. He challenged all leaders in the country to avoid politics of hatred and focus on their roles, adding that God will reward them. Uhuru remembered the late Mzee Moi for his respect adding that the former President had a strength that came from humility. “For 17 years he served the founding father, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta with respect and extended it to the people of Kenya when he took over power,” he said. He said Moi respected President Mwai Kibaki although he was not his choice. “I had a problem when I was elected President because Mzee Moi would always stand  and greet me regardless of the age," he said. Among those in attendance were former Vice President, Kalonzo Musyoka, and Musalia Mudavadi among others.
