During the briefings, Health DG Patrick Amoth said that 59 cases of deaths from the total number of deaths are cancer-related. "3 per cent of Covid deaths are related to cancer or occur to people who had cancer as an underlying condition," Amoth said. Amoth added that the ministry is targeting the people who are at the highest risk of getting the virus in its test, including the truck drivers. Amoth said that the country will receive Covid vaccines under the COVAX Facility by late February. “We are supposed to receive 4,176,000 doses of AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine…anytime beginning mid this month, towards the end of this month we should be able to have our vaccines in the country.” CAS Aman said that as the country joins the world in commemorating World Cancer Day, Kenyans should take a step and take part in cancer screening. "Cancer is one of the underlying diseases that have had a major impact when it comes to the Coronavirus disease." Also, the ministry said that the top five cancers diagnosed annually in the country are breast cancer with approximately 6,800 new cases, cervical cancer (5,200), prostate (3,400), oesophagus (2,900), and colorectal 2,724 new cases, accounting to 50 per cent of all new cancer cases annually.
