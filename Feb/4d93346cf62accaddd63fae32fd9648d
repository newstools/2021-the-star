Former Tetu MP Ndung'u Gethenji is in trouble again. He has been reported at Gigiri police station for hitting a security guard at Kihingo Village on Friday night. At 11.28pm on February 5, Gethenji arrived at the gate of Kihingo Village where he lives and where he has been in a protracted dispute with the other residents. As a result, he has been removed from the chairmanship of Kihingo Village Management Company and no longer plays any part in the management of the upmarket estate in Kitisuru. Gethenji was annoyed that Securex was recently appointed to provide security to Kihingo Village and that his preferred security company  911 was blocked from entering  the estate. On Friday night, a Kihingo guard called Godfrey asked the driver to lower the windows of Ndungu's vehicle so that he could check that they were not surreptitiously smuggling in any 911 guards. An irate Ndung'u and his bodyguard then got out of the car. In the CCTV video of the gate, the former MP is clearly seen to hit and then kick the guard. The guard was taken to MP Shah Hospital where he was given three stitches to close the wound. The assault was reported to Gigiri police station but no action has yet been taken by the police on the matter. Gethenji is involved in multiple criminal and civil suits over his long-running but unsuccessful battle to retain control of Kihingo Village which was developed in partnership with his two estranged brothers and his late mother.
