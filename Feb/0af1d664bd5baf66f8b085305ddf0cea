The Kwale government will spend more than Sh880 million to strengthen water pump systems, connectivity and upgrade urban-rural roads. Governor Salim Mvurya said that through the World Bank partnerships, they have launched several water projects that will address scarcity. “More boreholes and dams will help end water shortage witnessed in some of the areas‚” he said. The construction of the boreholes alone will cost about Sh600 million. Currently, the Sh426 million Marere water project is ongoing in Matuga. Once completed, Tumaini and Golini residents will benefit, using it for both domestic and agricultural purposes. Mvurya said his administration is proactive in preparing the county for a major development shift. He said they aim at upgrading towns to municipalities, hence the need to construct surplus roads to tackle traffic tailbacks as the urban centres grow. Sh134 million has been set aside to tarmac the Mvindeni-Lofta road in Msambweni to decongest Kona ya Beach route in Diani. The road will be complete by April Kinango and Lunga-Lunga have yet to be upgraded to municipalities after the elevation of Kwale and Diani last year. Mvurya said once the towns are upgraded, he will ensure food security and put in place mechanisms that promote business. “We intend to create a friendly environment that will pave way for various employment opportunities,” Mvurya said. The governor said they will replicate the Nyalani food security project in Kinango in various parts of the county. The Nyalani Food programme was started in 2016 to curb hunger and poverty through agribusiness. This followed the rehabilitation of Nyalani dam in 2014. He said the move will help produce surplus food that will encourage a competitive business environment, thus improving livelihoods and the county's economy. Mvurya said the multimillion Kombani wholesale market is 95 per cent complete and will soon be commissioned to help serve the growing towns.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
