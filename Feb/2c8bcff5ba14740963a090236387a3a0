A decline in performance was expected not only among Grade 4 and Std 8 learners but across the board. This is because both the 8-4-4 education system and the new curriculum need practice, including regular reading and engagement. Learners were at home for nine months, others 10 months, with zero interaction. The little interventions adopted such as online learning, radio, and TV lessons did not do much. This is the reason there is a big disparity between the performance of learners in urban areas and those in rural setups. Those in urban areas at least have better access to the internet and devices such as mobile phones and laptops through which learners were able to interact with educational content and material. The decline in performance is also expected to be reflected in the KCPE and KCSE exams, which are to start in a few weeks. We might be forced to go back to the standardisation of exam results. Otherwise, we will lock out rural children from getting admission in national schools and public universities. Teachers and learners also come into the picture as they are the ones bearing the burden of recovery. Maybe the pressure of recovery is the reason there are stand-offs in schools. We need to support our teachers and students as well during this phase. Teachers will also need to change how they interact and deal with learners. The children of this era have grown bold and have the guts to talk back to the teacher. During my time that was not the case; the teacher's word was final. So commanding and ordering them around will not work. Teachers will need a different strategy in handling learners. The Education ministry should also fast-track the posting of chaplains to schools. The chaplains will help in guidance and counselling of learners Finally, the ministry should use this report to establish sustainable continuity in education should there be a halt in teaching and learning in future.
