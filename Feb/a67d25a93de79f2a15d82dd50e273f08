A viral photo claiming that President Uhuru Kenyatta was watching Selina, a popular local television show is false. The photo widely shared on social media claimed that after the president was reminded by one of the actors in the show, he finally got some time to follow. A viral video showed president Uhuru Kenyatta strolling along the road as Pascal Tokodi well known as Nelson in the show expressed joy for seeing him. He then tells the president to catch-up with him on the show. "Ona Selina!" Ona Selina!" He could be heard shouting, urging the president to tune in to the next episode of Selina drama TV show, where he plays the role of starring. The following day, the doctored photo with a caption that read "Mzee finally got time to watch Selina" went viral. But the Star ran a forensic analysis on the said photo and established that it had been altered. The original photo was captured by the Presidential Press Unit -PSCU in April 2020 during the virtual meeting with the special coronavirus emergency taskforce. We also ran a forensic analysis on the photo and obtained results on how it was manipulated. The Star thus concludes the photo is FAKE and DOCTORED.
