The Langata based detectives are investigating how a civilian, Gregory Simiyu Mabele started conducting his self-assigned, illegal night patrols in Langataâ€™s Southlands area. The detectives said that the suspect was donned in fatigues belonging to the police and impersonated a police officer. Sleuths are suspecting that Simiyu is part of a wider cabal of criminals, who pose as police officers and betray the trust of unsuspecting members of the public by defrauding and stealing from them. The 40-year-old suspect was arrested last night past curfew hours, as he walked around the Southlands suburbs, pretending to be offering public safety and security services. The suspect is currently in police custody and will be arraigned on Monday. He is expected to answer the charges of being in unlawful possession of government stores contrary to Section 324 (2) and Impersonating a police officer contrary to Section 101 (1) (b) of the National Police Service Act.
