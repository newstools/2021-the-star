A student at Gesusu Boys High School in Masaba South in Kisii County died on Friday afternoon after he was reported to have been feeling unwell. A teacher at the school said the student was found in 'bad shape' by other students who informed the management. "He was in the dormitory when it was reported that he was not feeling well and we quickly rushed him to hospital only to succumb minutes after arrival," said the teacher. The student had history of asthma and epilepsy and had been on drugs. "He has been on drugs throughout," the teacher said. The student was rushed to Medstop Hospital, in Keroka, where he was pronounced dead. He had returned to the school on Sunday last week after days away for treatment, the teacher said. " Since September last year, he has been in and out of school seeking treatment," the teacher told the Star on the phone. School Principal Lukas Matiko did not pick calls when the Star reached out to him by phone. Kisii County Police Commander Jebel Munene said investigations have started.
