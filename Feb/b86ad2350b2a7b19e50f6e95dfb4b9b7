The Law Society of Kenya council has raised concerns over salary delays of staff members. In a letter to acting President Carolyne Kamande, the council said the delay has continued to cause employees anguish despite interventions. "The Council has previously implored you to undertake your mandate as the chairperson of staff and finance committee and as a bank account signatory to ensure that you approve staff salaries in good time," read part of the letter. According to the council, Kamande has refused to approve the salaries on the online banking platform. "You have since November 2020 to date cited different excuses that do not hold water as to why you have failed to approve staff salaries," the letter read on Friday. They also claim that Kamande has been giving excuses that she was blocked from accessing the banks online portal. In the letter signed by eight council members, they claim that if the payment of the salaries is not approved immediately, the staff are likely going to be subjected to more financial burdens thus exposing the society to more lawsuits. "It is disheartening to receive calls from staff members whose children have been chased away from school due to unpaid school fees and houses have been locked due to unpaid rent," the council said. "The Council notes with great concern your failure to act within your mandate and further, the breach of the duty owed by yourself to the staff members and of us all collectively as the Council."
