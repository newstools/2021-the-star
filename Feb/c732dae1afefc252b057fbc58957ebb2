Veterinary officers in Bomet county have asked Sotik residents to avoid touching their animals' carcasses to prevent a possible spread of anthrax. Anthrax attacks and sometimes kills animals but can spread to humans who come into contact with their carcasses. Veterinary and Kenya Red Cross officials met residents of Kapkures in Sotik to sensitise them over the increased cases of anthrax in the area. Statistics from the disease surveillance team in the county shows that since 2015 two people have died and 25 cases reported in the area. During the same period, an outbreak has killed 21 animals. Some 15 animals have died this year. The county has designated the area a high-risk zone. The Health department says there was close contact between the humans and the dead cows either through the disposal of the carcasses or some residents ate the meat. “This disease is bacterial, it is spread from animals to humans either through touching or consuming the meat of a dead animal and we are asking them to be cautious about animals that suddenly fall and die,” Gilbert Korir said. Monica Okwany, Red Cross programme coordinator, said epidemics begin and end with communities hence the need for a whole society approach to prevent, detect and respond to such waves. “Through the support of all stakeholders and coordinated multi-sectorial approach famously known as one health approach we aim at ensuring locals are educated on how to prevent the spread of the diseases in our communities,” she said. County veterinary officer Dr Wilson Serem assured the residents that vaccination of all animals against the disease would start soon.
