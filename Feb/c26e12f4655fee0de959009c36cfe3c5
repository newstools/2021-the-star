A 49-year-old man has been sentenced to life in prison for defiling an eight-year-old girl in Lamu county. Gailord Landi, a small scale trader, is said to have waited for the girl’s mother to go to the market after which he visited their house and tricked her younger brother with sweets before carrying the girl on his back to his house, about 200 meters away and defiling her. He was charged with committing the heinous act contrary to the Sexual Offences Act, 2006. Landi denied the charges forcing the court to rely on witnesses. While pronouncing the judgement at the Lamu law courts on Tuesday, Principal magistrate Allan Temba ruled that the evidence produced including a medical report was adequate to convince the court that Landi defiled the girl. “Even though you pleaded not guilty at the onset of this case, the evidence produced in this court reveals that you committed the offence. You will therefore serve life imprisonment,” Temba said. The accused has 14 days to appeal. In July 2020, the same court sentenced police constable Rodgers Ouma to life in prison after he was found guilty of raping a woman who had sought help at the Lamu police station while he was on duty.
