Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has said achieving Premier League safety is difficult and his club would need a huge investment to reach the top half of the table. Palace lost their last two league games against Leeds United and Burnley and are 14th in league standings with 29 points after 24 games, seven points above the relegation zone. “It is not a bad achievement for a team that has actually spent not very much money and has worked within a reasonable budget to be in the league every year,” Hodgson said. “If people want more than that then it is going to take an enormous amount of investment because these days to get yourself into that top half ... is going to involve a massive expenditure.” Hodgson’s side travel to 16th-placed Brighton & Hove Albion on Monday.
