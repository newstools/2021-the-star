St Paul's University on Thursday installed its third vice-chancellor in an event attended by Senate Majority leader Samuel Poghisiso as chief guest. Prof James Kombo, former Daystar University vice-chancellor, was installed at the graduation square on main campus, Limuru, by the university council, led by chancellor Margaret Kobia. He took over from Prof Joseph Galgalo, who was lauded by nearly all speakers for the institution's growth. They urged the new VC to fast-track change. Galgalo headed the university from 2010, only three years after the institution was chartered by former President Mwai Kibaki in 2007. Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit, who doubles as the university council chairman, said the 10 years of growth has been felt in the human resource department, infrastructure and academic achievements. “The growth in terms of human resource and infrastructure by adding more lecture rooms, halls, and courses that help our society and the need to further them has been felt,” he said. Poghisio, who was the chief guest, urged the institution to support Kombo, saying he was selected on merit. He urged Kombo to embark on teamwork so he can learn from and teach the council and the people he will be working with. Poghisio urged society to adopt change and technology to ease their ways of doing things. “When our country was hit by the coronavirus pandemic, things changed to online. We hold virtual meetings, learning takes place there, a well as shopping and many others‚” he said. Kombo praised his predecessor and the varsity as a whole for espousing teamwork. He has over 25 years of experience in leading universities administratively, academically and in research.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
