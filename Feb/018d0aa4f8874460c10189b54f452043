Rehema Muthamia is the winner of the first-ever Miss All African Colours England. Muthamia is now a finalist of Miss England. This new category was introduced after the Black Lives Matter protest. "All of the ladies have been judged throughout the entire competition on various skills and attributes that are essential not only in Miss England, but Miss World," read a statement on their official social media page. The director, Angie Beasley, said the pageant wanted to include communities living in England. "Itâ€™s difficult to get the message across to all communities that anyone from any ethnicity can enter as long as they can abide by the rules and hold a British passport. England is seen as a great destination of diversity and it is important Miss England reflects that," she wrote on Miss England website.
