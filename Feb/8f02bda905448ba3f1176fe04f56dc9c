Nigerian talent Teni the Entertainer has joined forces with Afrobeats star Davido in a new single, 'For You'. Teni describes the song as an emotion-tinged slice of Afrobeats. "'For You' is a record I made to celebrate the essence of love, sacrifice and the reaffirmation to always be there for that special someone who means the world to you,” she said. “I always wanted to make a record like this with Davido, especially because of my admiration for him as an artiste, father and someone with a big heart." Davido said, "This is a special record and as a father of three beautiful kids, I know how much they mean to me and how I am ready to give them everything good the world has to offer.” This song will feature in Teni's upcoming debut album, 'Wondaland'.
