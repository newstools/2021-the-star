ODM leader Raila Odinga has rubbished claims from some quarters that he wants to use BBI to capture the presidency. He said his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta was meant to address challenges facing the country. The former Prime Minister said the next President will be elected by Kenyans and he will not use the law change process to take power. “Hii BBI sio mlango eti Raila anatumia kuingia State House, kama Raila anataka kwenda State House, si Wakenya wanampeleka? (This BBI is not a door for Raila to enter State House. If Raila wants to get elected, Kenyans will decide),” the ODM leader said. The opposition chief was speaking on Friday during the burial of  Bonchari MP Oroo oyioka. He said the same characters claiming he is using the process to get to State House were opposed to BBI long before the document was drafted. “Some of those people started opposing BBI even before the first draft was out,” Raila said. The AU special envoy on infrastructure exuded confidence that the  majority of Kenyans will support BBI in a referendum, owing to the numerous benefits it contains. He cited the increased county allocations and the tax holidays for youths as some of the benefits that will improve the lives of Kenyans. He thanked MCAs from Kisii and Nyamira counties for passing the bill. Present were Kisii Governor James Ongwae, Transport CAS Chris Obure, senators Sam Ongeri (Kisii) and Okong'o Omogeni (Nyamira), Woman Reps Janet Ong'era (Kisii) and Jerusha Momanyi (Nyamira), and a number of MPs.
