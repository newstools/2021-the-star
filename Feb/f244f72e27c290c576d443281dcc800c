Three accused persons in Migori Governor Okoth Obado's corruption case now want the High Court to suspend their trial pending determination of their case. Joram Opala, Carolyne Ochola and Patroba Ochanda have filed a case at the High Court seeking a review of a ruling by the trial court. In the ruling delivered in December last year, Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi declined to order the DPP to reduce 22 charges. In an application by lawyer George Kithi, the accused want the court to set aside Mugambi's ruling. The three were charged alongside Obado and his four children in August last year. They were charged with conspiracy to commit a felony, several counts of conflict of interest and money laundering. Kithi argues that his clients' reputations built over the years have been irreparable and damaged by the "exaggerated and excessive allegations". "As a natural consequence, our client has been exposed to ridicule, humiliation, hatred, scandal and contempt in the eyes of the family and members of the society," Kithi says. They want the court to find and rule that the charge sheet with 22 counts is complex and overloaded. In his affidavit to court, Opala says if the trial proceeds without alterations of the charge sheet, it will be against his constitutional rights. "The plethora of charges causes embarrassment to the accused persons and difficulty in the prosecution of the cases through undue complexity " Opala argues. Justice James Wakiaga on Thursday certified the matter as urgent and directed then to serve the petition to the DPP. The case will be mentioned on March 10 before the duty judge Anti-corruption court. On Wednesday this week, Justice Wakiaga dismissed an application by Opala to move the case to Migori.
