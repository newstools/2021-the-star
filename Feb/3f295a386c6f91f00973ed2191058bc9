Liverpool midfielder Fabinho is set to miss the club’s next two Premier League games due to injury but could return in time to face title rivals Manchester City, said manager Juergen Klopp. The 27-year-old Brazil international, who has filled in at centre back with several defenders out injured, missed Thursday’s 3-1 win at Tottenham Hotspur with a muscle injury. Liverpool visit West Ham United on Sunday before hosting Brighton on Wednesday and Man City on Feb. 7. “Minor issues nowadays are at least three games,” Klopp told reporters ahead of the game against fifth-placed West Ham. “It depends on the week— it could be four games as well. We have to see. “I think the game where Fab could be back is City.” Klopp also said midfielder Naby Keita, who has not featured since the 7-0 win at Crystal Palace last month, is close to returning to action. Champions Liverpool are third in the table with 40 points from 21 games, four points behind leaders City.
