The relocation of services and encroachment of road reserve have been highlighted as the major challenges faced by contractors working on the Marsabit roads project. The Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) has said the project, which will cost Sh705.9 million, is at 21 per cent complete. The 10km road network consists of 17 roads. “The contractor on-site is experiencing a few challenges that include the relocation of services such as water, power and communication lines, the encroachment of the road reserve and drainage issues,” Kura director general Silas Kinoti said. Work on the project commenced on July 24, 2020, and is expected to complete by July 24, 2022. The project scope includes six-metre wide carriageway, two-metre wide footpaths on both sides and installation of drainage facilities. The road is expected to transform Marsabit as part of the authority’s programme to open up the county headquarters for development. On Thursday, Eng Daniel Ndiritu said once complete, the project will improve the transport network, boost business, improve security and change the face of Marsabit town. “The upgrading of roads within Marsabit town will be a game-changer as it will enable residents to move with ease, access schools, hospitals and other social amenities swiftly as we embark on improving the face of Marsabit town,” he said. In addition, Kura has called upon residents to use the road in the right way and thanked them for the cooperation. “Through the project implementation, residents have acquired gainful employment opportunities hence improving their livelihoods,” Ndiritu said.
