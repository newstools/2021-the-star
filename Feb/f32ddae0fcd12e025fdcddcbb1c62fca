There was drama at the Nakuru County Assembly on Tuesday as members argued over the Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020. A shouting match ensued as a section of the MCAs wondered why the Building Bridges Initiative Bill was being tabled before the House first instead of being taken through public participation. A different faction led by Naivasha East Ward Representative, Stanley Karanja said it was right to be taken through the County Assembly because members directly and indirectly represented views of the people. Speaker Joel Kairu had a hard time calming the two factions which could not let each other speak. The most vocal MCA who opposed tabling of the Bill was Kabazi ward Rep, Peter Mbae who sought clarification on how the voice of common mwananchi will be incorporated. “The BBI Bill should be subjected to public participation before being passed by the County Assembly,” shouted Mbae against several voices who were shutting him down. Mbae said he will not be intimidated into supporting the Bill which was tabled at the Assembly by Deputy Speaker, Joseph Tonui and committed to the Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. Some MCAs accused Mbae of publicly opposing BBI and claiming that he was speaking on behalf of the County Assembly and demanded disciplinary action against him. Speaker Kairu handed over the Bill to the joint Justice and Legal and the Rules and Delegated committees for further action. “The Bill will be subjected to Public Participation to ensure the views of residents are collected before being discussed in the House,” said Kairu. The speaker denied claims that Governor Lee Kinyanjui was managing the House, adding that the Assembly was an independent entity complete with its own calendar. On Sunday, Kinyanjui intimated that Nakuru and Laikipia together with all counties in Mt Kenya region will pass the constitutional amendment bill on February 23.
