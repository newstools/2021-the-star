US. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told Congress he intends to revoke the designation of Yemen's Houthi movement as a terrorist organization, a State Department official said on Friday. "Our action is due entirely to the humanitarian consequences of this last-minute designation from the prior administration, which the United Nations and humanitarian organizations have since made clear would accelerate the worldâ€™s worst humanitarian crisis," the official said.
