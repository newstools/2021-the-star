Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has claimed that the ongoing  campaigns by the Deputy President William Ruto is a threat to national security. He called on the National Police Service take decisive action to nip in bud the campaigns claiming that they are likely to plunge the country into a state of anarchy. Wandayi said the paralysis at the top leadership of the Jubilee Party is a threat to national security. He said its only in Kenya that you can find a deputy president embarked on a full fledge campaigns two years before elections against the wishes of everybody including his own boss. Wandayi further stated that nobody has stopped any other person from fighting to become president or from competing in anything. "Making your case for a leadership position to be a matter of life and death that even if people get hurt or injured in the process it does not matter until you get what your objective. We shall not allow". Meanwhile, Ruto has cautioned leaders from joining Jubilee to ruin it with an aim of being endorsed as presidential candidates. He noted on Friday during during a series of meetings in Kilifi and Mombasa Counties that such a scheme would not bear fruits, adding that Kenya was past the politics of endorsements. “You cannot be in the Opposition and bank on an endorsement from Jubilee. Go out and engage with Kenyans,” he said. Ruto observed that leaders must stop the political conmanship of wandering around Jubilee. “Organise yourselves politically. We do not want a recurrence of a fake swearing-in ceremony,” he added.
