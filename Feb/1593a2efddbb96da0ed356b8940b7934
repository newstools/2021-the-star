Construction of link roads is underway in Githurai 45 in Ruiru, Kiambu county Completion is expected in a month. Drainage will be built and street lights installed. The Kenya Urban Roads Authority started laying cabro bricks last week. The roads will link estates within Githurai with the almost-complete Githurai modern market. Ruiru MP Simon King’ara inspected the works and said the 4.5km link roads will also connect estates to the Githurai Railway station and ease traffic in the highly populated area. The project is part of the Sh800 million Githurai Market Project of the state department for Housing and Urban Development. “The Jubilee government promised Githurai residents a modern market, which is almost complete, and proper roads within the estate for easy market access," King'ara said. "These roads will go a long way in changing and improving the face of Githurai. We expect this region’s economy to blossom because of these roads,” he said. King’ara said proper drainage will be constructed to end perennial flooding in much of Githurai. “Street lights will be installed to enhance security as Githurai gears up to become a 24-hour economy,” the MP said. “The roads have been in a dire state for many years. Coupled with floods when it rains, we have been going through untold suffering to access our homes," resident Mary Mumbi said. Boda boda rider Kelvin Kimathi said he will make more money as he had to pay a lot to maintain his motorcycle because of dilapidated roads. “Hardly a week passed without visiting the mechanic and this reduced my earnings. Now there's hope for more income," he said King’ara said that he will lobby authorities for similar projects in Ruiru. (Edited by V. Graham)
