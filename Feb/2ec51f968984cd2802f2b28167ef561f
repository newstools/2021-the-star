Spare the rod and spoil the child? No way, say Kirinyaga counsellors. Violence seldom cures violence. They have urged the state to introduce counselling departments in schools to arrest unruliness, violence and arson. The professionals, through Rose Wachira,  lso appealed to the Ministry of Education to carry out massive drug testing among students as ending drug abuse would also curb indiscipline. "We want qualified counselors posted to schools as they have the ability to tackle and change students’ psychological behaviour," she said.. It is also important for schools to strengthen existing guidance and counselling departments for students' mental wellness, Wachira of said. Caning and the court system are not the best way, far from it, as they entrench resentment, counsellors said. The counsellors spoke at Kutus Primary school before taking head teachers and boards of managements through a session of the importance of having guidance and counseling departments in schools. More than 31 schools have reported fires, many of them arson, since schools reopened in January. Riots, fightingand assaults on teachers also have been reported. “We will to take students through counseling as they simultaneously undergo rehabilitation for three months. Then they can resume their studies," Wachira said. "Taking legal action is not the cure, what they need is help," she said. She also said reintroduction of caning is not the way to correct bad habits, saying guidance is the correct way to help students reform and realise themselves. The counsellors said parental negligence has given rise to indiscipline and "moral decadence". Parents need to take their roles seriously and team up with teachers to instil responsible behavior in their children, the counsellors said. (Edited by V. Graham)
