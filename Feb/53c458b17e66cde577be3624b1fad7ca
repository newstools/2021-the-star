King Kaka has released the song 'Utanipata' featuring Kristoff. He says he intentionally used plus-size women to appreciate them, unlike in many music videos. "Let me be honest. I chose to put plus-size women in the ‘Utanipata’ video because they are part of our society, they are our friends, our sisters, our mothers. So why shouldn’t they be in a music video? Why? Tuwache ujinga," he wrote yesterday on Instagram. Adding, "I have seen some characters attack them for their weight, ati why are they there? The moment we realise that we are all equal and humans, then everything will make sense. You might never know what someone is going through and what the effects might be. Tuwache siasa na ujinga."
