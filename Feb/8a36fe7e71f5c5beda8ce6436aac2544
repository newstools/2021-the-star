Nairobi county assembly Majority leader Abdi Hassan Guyo will move a motion to rename a road within the Central Business District after the late Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji. The legislator said the late Senator was a man of high calibre whose spirit of servant-leadership is admired not only by Nairobi leaders but also most politicians across the country. “The service the late senator rendered to this country is enough for him to be honoured and I will be moving a motion next week on Tuesday to have a CBD road named after Haji,” Guyo said. Haji died last Monday morning at the Aga Khan University Hospital and was later in the afternoon interred at Lang'ata Muslim Cemetery in Nairobi. "The late senator was a man who for the last 55 years served with dedication and selflessness, something which most youths who are leaders lack," Guyo said. Last week on Thursday before the assembly passed the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020, Majority leader Guyo requested the house to pay tribute to Haji by observing a moment of silence. He noted that Haji midwifed the BBI Bill that will make Kenya enjoy peace and bring changes in Nairobi. Nairobi is among the biggest beneficiaries of an additional 16 MPs proposed in the Bill. With the proposed Ward Development Fund, each of the 85 elected city MCAs would control upwards of Sh20 million. At least five per cent of the county government revenue would be channelled to the proposed fund. “ His contribution towards the BBI report cannot go unnoticed especially to the people of Nairobi and having a road in the city named after the late senator will be a great way to remember the noble man,” he said.
