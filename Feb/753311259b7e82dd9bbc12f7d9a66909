The Ugandan man who was arrested a week ago for allegedly fixing a match has been released by a Kisumu court. Ronald Mugisha was yesterday released by Senior Resident Magistrate, Winfrida Onkunya. This is after the officer who was handling the case, Benedict Kwanza, told the court that the complainant in the matter decided not to pursue the case. Kwanza requested the court to close the miscellaneous file. "I want to tell the court that the complainant has decided not to pursue the matter further. We, therefore request for the miscellaneous file to be closed,"he said. The magistrate granted the officers request and closed the file. "The miscellaneous file is closed and the accused person maybe released." Last Monday, Mugisha failed to take plea after the investigative Officer requested to be granted 7 days to complete investigations. Mugisha was arrested by DCI at a  Kisumu  hotel for allegedly trying to fix a Kenyan Premier League match involving Western Stima and KCB that was scheduled to take place at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru. The matter was reported by Stima chairman Laban Jobita. The said manager informed the accused that he needed to discuss the matter with his players but proceeded to report the matter at the station. Police officers disguised themselves as players and accompanied the reportee and several players to the  hotel where they informed the suspect that they had agreed to fix the match. The suspect, therefore, gave out Sh10, 000 purportedly being lunch pending payment of USD 5000 upon successfully losing the game and immediately the officers arrested him.
