ODM leader Raila Odinga has raised concern with the growing numbers of mental health cases in the country. The opposition chief urged Kenyans to be each other’s keeper and help those battling the illness seek medical attention. Via social media on Friday, Raila noted that the condition should not be used to profile the victims. “Fellow countrymen and women. I’m deeply concerned and alarmed about the reported increase in numbers of our people battling mental illness. Instead of ostracizing and labeling those in that lonely corner, let us embrace and encourage them to seek treatment,” Raila said. It is estimated that one in every 10 people suffer from a common mental disorder. The number increases to one in every four people among patients attending routine outpatient services. Depression and anxiety disorders are listed among the leading mental illnesses diagnosed in the country, followed by substance use disorders. The AU special envoy on Infrastructure called on Kenyans to reach out and constantly check on friends, colleagues who might be battling the disease in silence. “When was the last time you checked on your children, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and loved ones? We all need someone at times...reach out to someone today.” Last year, the Taskforce on Mental Health recommended that mental illness be declared a national emergency of epidemic proportions, to prioritize mental health as a priority public health and socioeconomic agenda. The team chaired by Dr. Frank Njenga also recommended establishment of a mental health commission and happiness, to advise, coordinate and continuously monitor the status of mental health. Njenga led taskforce was inaugurated on December 11, 2019 and had membership drawn from Ministry of Health and other stakeholders. The report found out that majority of Kenyans still associate mental health and mental illness with negative narratives leading to low focus on the importance and benefits of mental health and well being.
