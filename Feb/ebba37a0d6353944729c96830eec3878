"I pray to be the best helper you can ever have coz I’m in your life to make sure you succeed. I pray to God to make me the best helper you’ll want and need, just like the Holy Spirit helps us Christians… be the best helper to you as a wife." On their seventh anniversary, Size 8 prayed for peace. "I pray that God may grant us more years together, with peace and this is just our beginning. We have learnt a lot and the God who started this marriage is faithful and will complete it," the mother of two wrote. "Thanks for being the dad, husband you are. You have done a lot and thanks for giving us a good Life. God bless you."
