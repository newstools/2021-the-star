Kitui leaders have urged residents to support the BBI and stay strong behind Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau, Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi, Woman Representative Irene Kasalu, former Governor Julius Malombe and former Senator David Musila all said Ukamabani people must remain united behind Kalonzo. They spoke at the weekend at a funeral in Ukasi in Mwingi Central. The leaders urged the Kitui county assembly to quickly pass the Constitution (Amendment) Bill 2020 once it is tabled before MCAs. They also asked residents to fully support Kalonzo as he prepares yo make another stab at the presidency. Kalonzo vied in 2007 and came a distant third behind Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga. Residents were cautioned to be wary of the hustler narrative being spearheaded by Deputy President William Ruto. The leaders said the hustler vs dynasty narrative was highly divisive. Mulyungi urged leaders from the region to unite and support the BBI saying the proposed amendments will benefit the region. "MCAs should pass the bill right away once it is tabled on the floor of the house," Mulyungi said. Woman Representative Kasalu urged Kitui residents not to be carried away by the hustler narrative. "It is very divisive and those selling the narrative here in Kitui should desist," she said. However, lawyer Wilfred Nyamu who said there was a big gap in the leadership of the BBI process, claiming no civic education had been conducted. He said Kenyans were unlikely to make informed decisions if a referendum was called.
