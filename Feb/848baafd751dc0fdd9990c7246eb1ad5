The Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya  educated over 100 games teachers in Kakamega County on the new anti-doping regulations over the weekend. ADAK’s Director of Education and Research Agnes Mandu said the teachers — drawn from 13 sub-counties of Kakamega — will instil the spirit of sports values and principles in children at the grassroots. “This will go a long way to inculcating values such as honesty, fairness, health, respect for rules, respect for self and others. Winning is not everything. School children should know that they can participate in sports just for fun or enjoyment," Mandu said. The county's Ministry of Education Quality Assurance Officer, Akoko Okayo thanked participants for their willingness to weed out doping. “I appreciate all the teachers who turned up and participated in the anti-doping workshop for their dedication and commitment in instilling the spirit of sport values and principles associated with clean sport among our school children in Kakamega,” he said. Mandu announced that ADAK is collaborating with Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to mainstream the spirit of sport values to children aged 16 years and below through Values-Based Education.
