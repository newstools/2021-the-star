Kenya Basketball Federation Division Two debutants Kisii Raptors are eyeing a dream debut against Nebulas at Kisii University on Saturday. Raptors head coach Vinny Onsongo said they are ready to make their bow with Hillary Simba and Derrick Momanyi expected to lead the onslaught. “We intensified our training in the last two weeks and I can confirm that we are ready for the game. We started our training way back in November and so the players are well prepared,” said Onsongo. “Our target is to finish in the top two positions and qualify for Division One next season. We have a very good and talented squad that can play in the top-tier league. This is an opportunity to put Kisii basketball on the national map.” Onsongo, however, noted that they have not beefed up the squad putting trust in the players who helped the team qualify to Division Two. “We will gauge the team then make necessary signings mid-season if possible. This can only happen if we identify weaknesses in the team. So far, I’m satisfied with the team because we have played several build-up matches which we have won,” Onsongo added. The team is mostly comprised of former and current Kisii University students. At the same venue, Kisii University’s ladies team will welcome Western Delight from in a Division One match. Coach Jared Kegicha said the team is targeting a top-two finish.
