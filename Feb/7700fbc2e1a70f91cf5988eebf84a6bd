Busia County has passed the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The county assembly on Tuesday became the fourth county after Siaya,Â Kisumu and Homa Bay county assemblies to pass the Bill. The MCAs overwhelmingly voted 'YES' to the bill that requires the approval of 24 county assemblies for it to be subjected to a referendum. The report of the County Assembly on Legal and Human Rights on the public participation and consideration of the constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was tabled by the committee chairman David Kokonya. Those who supported the Bill included John Obwogo, Novena Ndaliro, Cynthia Mutere, Moses Ochieng, Patrick Obuya Eunice Nyongesa, Fredrick Musirimba, Job Oteba, Grace Olita, Bernard Papa, Felix Omanyi and Leader of Majority, Kassaman Ekesa. Nominated MCA, Bernard Odako rejected the document over claims that he needed more time to go through the document before making an informed decision. Only Baringo County has so far rejected the Bill during a chaotic session last week.
