Residents of Limuru have complained about insecurity. They say the number of people being killed and dropped at the roadside is on the rise. On Friday, 26-year-old Patrick Kamau was found murdered and his body left at Mutarakwa along the Nairobi-Maai Mahiu road. Kamau worked with an insurance agency in Limuru town. He was identified by residents, including his family. Kamau's father James Njenga said he was polite, hardworking and had a lot of respect for people. He appealed to the police to investigate his death and bring his killers to book. "We were shocked when we heard a person had been found dead. We thought it was the unknown bodies we normally see along this road," he said. Peter Kimemia, a resident, urged the police to intensify day and night patrols, saying several bodies of unknown and known people have been reported. "Sometimes back, we used to find bodies of unknown people having been dropped along this road. They were either clothed or naked. We have been shocked since this time round it is one of us," he said. The hotspots are Mutarakwa, Tuekunu, Ndiuni and Tharuni. Last week, the body of an unknown person was found in Ndiuni area, with some parts already eaten by wild animals. Subcounty police commander Joseph Ireri said investigations were ongoing. He said Kamau's case was an isolated one given that he was a resident. "Even as we investigate the others, we shall also investigate Kamau's case to establish what really happened and killed him," he said.
