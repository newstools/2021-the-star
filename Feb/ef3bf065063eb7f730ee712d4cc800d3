While announcing the closure vice CDF Levi Mughalu said so far 150 general service officers _ GSO cadets, 150 general service officers undergraduates, 3550 general duty recruits, and 150 defense constables have been called. Mughalu said while the GSOs and undergraduates will report at the Kenya military academy in Lanet, the others will report at the training center in Eldoret in batches. He said for those who applied for tradesmen and other cadres the shortlisted candidates will be published in the national papers between Feb 22-25. They should appear in interview centers with original certificates after official notification. Mughalu said all the candidates will be scrutinized for a second time and undergo a medical examination. "We have had 12 incidences of corruption reported. Investigations have commenced and necessary action will be taken," he said. He said stern action will be taken in accordance with military provisions. While dismissing claims that the excise was discriminatory against women, Mughalu said the number of women has been increasing gradually. He said the number has increased to 12 per cent compared to 10 per cent in 2018. The VCDF said drug addiction and alcoholism remain some of the major factors that hinder youth from joining the service.
