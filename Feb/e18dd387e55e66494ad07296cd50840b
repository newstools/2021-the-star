It is not yet campaign period, Baringo Governor Stanley Kiptis has said after being booed by residents during Deputy President William Ruto’s rally in Kabarnet town on Saturday. Kiptis accused his opponents of assigning goons to heckle him during the meeting. “I want to tell my political competitors that 2022 is still far. They should relax and wait until then so they can face me head on,” he said on Monday. Two Senator Gideon Moi’s Kanu supporters were also  nearly lynched. The crowd shouted down Kiptis and demanded former Governor Benjamin Cheboi to address the rally. Residents accused the governor of failing to utilise county funds well to complete pending projects. The county boss however extended his gratitude to Ruto for visiting the county “to meet the hustlers and opening development projects". Kiptis said the people of Baringo are peaceful and condemned the youth who booed him, saying they were used by his political rivals to cause chaos. "This is just but politics which are being perpetrated by my opponents. But I want to tell them that I will still continue working and deliver my mandate for the people of Baringo who elected me," he said. Hopefuls expected to challenge Governor Kiptis in 2022 are  Tourism and Wildlife PS Fred Segor, Baringo county assembly clerk Richard Koech, retired commissioner Haron Komen and former Kenya School of Government Baringo campus director Isaac Chebon.
