Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo  has denied reports he has ditched ODM, saying  he will defend his seat on the party's ticket. He said those seeking to unseat him must brace themselves for a battle royal. Ottichilo expressed confidence that he will be reelected based on his track record. “Don’t expect to snatch a flesh from a dog’s mouth that easily, you may end up being additional flesh,” he warned. Those who have shown interest in the race include Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi, Vihiga Senator George Khaniri, former Governor Moses Akaranga and businessman Alex Kidaki. Ottichilo was being linked to ANC and Ford Kenya parties as one of his targets vehicles for next year's election. But the county chief said he is an ODM life member No:93 and the longest party serving member in the county. He was elected for the first time as Emuhaya MP on the party's ticket in 2008 to replace Kenneth Marende who was elected speaker of the National Assembly. Ottichilo defended his parliamentary seat in 2013. In 2017, he outvoted then-incumbent Akaranga to become governor, still on the ODM ticket. “For those who are saying I have left ODM, which parameters are they using to gauge me?" he asked. "All party systems in all five subcounties are intact and I'm there to make sure they run properly.” His remarks come after Bishop Charles Sande of Upendo Pentecostal Fellowship Church accused him of neglecting the party and its supporters. Sande spoke to the Star at his home. He said the governor was not even considering his ODM supporters for employment in the county.
