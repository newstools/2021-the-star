Former Tahidi High actor Joseph Kinuthia, popularly known as Omosh, is asking for your help. The father of five in a recent interview said he is facing eviction over rent arrears, which have accumulated to over Sh100,000. In an interview with Hiram Maina on YouTube, Omosh narrated his tribulations, leaving Kenyans moved to tears. "After I left Tahidi High, I have been surviving through friends and neighbours. I have nothing to do," he said, bursting into tears. "Have you ever been in that situation where you are walking while crying? That is what I go through. Most of the times I leave the house well dressed but going nowhere." He added that he finds himself crying, wondering how he will feed his children in the evening. Omosh is married to two wives and has five children. In a past interview with Radio Jambo, Omosh said things got worse after Covid-19 hit as he used to get gigs from schools. "I even contemplated committing suicide last year but a few friends came through and talked to me." Despite the tough times, Omosh says he hasn’t given up on praying, hoping one day he will secure a job and be the sole provider for his family. "Sometimes, I walk out at night to pray and I just sit there and cry. I ask God if He has forgotten me and even left me. God has been good to me as I have not missed my meals." Omosh also recounted his long struggle with alcohol addiction, admitting that a close friend introduced him to the ‘demonic’ thing. He managed to fight the addiction and is currently appealing to Kenyans to help him get a job opportunity or start a business. He added that he is a good driver and has a driving licence. "I just want a job, even if I will be getting Sh200 a day. I don't mind about class and even if someone decides to start a hotel business where I can sell porridge and tea, I am okay with that."
