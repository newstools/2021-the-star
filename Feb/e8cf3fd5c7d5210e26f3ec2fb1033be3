Yvette Obura, mother of Bahati's first child Mueni, says the reason she broke up with the singer is that she was not ready for the limelight. Speaking on Massawe Japanni’s show on Radio Jambo, Yvette said she got tired. "Nothing bad happened and people fall in and out of love. We got to a point where we fell out of love after Mueni was born," she said. Asked who fell out of love first, Yvette smiled and said, "I did. It gets to that point where everyone gets there. "Away from being his baby mama, I don’t like the limelight at all. I could not handle it." Yvette explained how she handles co-parenting with Bahati her high school sweetheart, who is now married to Diana Marua. “Co-parenting is amazing. It depends with the individuals. We decided nothing is going on between me and Bahati; he is married, I’m seeing someone else, tunatoa wapi drama? Hakuna at all, we are all mature and respect iko, but it also takes God.” Bahati and Diana are celebrating five years since they started their relationship, while Yvette's daughter Mueni is also five years old. Asked if Diana stole Bahati from her when she was pregnant, she said, "Aaaaah hapana. She did not. Mueni was already born. "And social media, there is that narrative, like how are they celebrating their five years and Mueni is five years old? I mean, what is the big deal? Hakuna kitu kubwa hapo, but that narrative has been going." Yvette met Bahati in high school, Huruma. "We fell in love, dated for a while, we got pregnant. I fell back. I had a lot of things happening at the same time, I could not handle being a first-time mum, being in a relationship with a public figure."
