Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's doctor now says he needs to travel to South Africa for surgery. Sonko, who has been in hospital for over two weeks, needs a hip replacement surgery. In a report to the court seen by the Star, Dr Esther Wekesa from KNH says the hip replacement surgery is needed urgently because Sonko has already developed severe arthritis. "If left untreated, avascular necrosis can lead to severe complications such as bone collapse or even fracture," Wekesa says. She further claims that they have chosen the services of South African based surgeon Dr. Robert Van Der Plank who came highly recommended. However, Plank cannot travel to Kenya at the moment and says he will review Sonko in Johannesburg. "I have spoken with Dr. Plank on phone and email about taking up the case but he has not been to Kenya in the last 2 years and says he won't be coming anytime soon," the report reads. The other two suspects who were arrested with Sonko in the terrorism case have been released unconditionally. Lawyer Danstan Omari for the defence told the court in Kamiti that the two have contracted Covid-19 while in custody. Omari told the court that the two who have been in custody for 26 days were being victimized for being associates of Sonko. The prosecution told the court that they had concluded investigations on the two and will not be charging them. The case will be mentioned on March 3 when the trial Magistrate who was away on Friday will be back to give directions on the medical report produced in court.
