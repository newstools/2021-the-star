The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has activated a tax compliance drive aimed at facilitating the Voluntary Tax Disclosure Programme (VTDP). The VDTP provides a platform for a taxpayer to disclose tax liabilities that were previously undisclosed to the commissioner for the purpose of being granted relief of penalties and interest arising from the tax disclosed. The programme is aimed at improving revenue collection through enhanced compliance. Speaking during the confirmation of the VTDP drive, KRA Commissioner for Domestic Taxes Rispah Simiyu said, the taxpayers have been urged to take advantage of the prevailing VTDP which allows for the declaration of previously undeclared taxes. “As part of our administrative actions, we have already dispatched notices to thousands of taxpayers asking them to take advantage of the VTDP by declaring and remitting their previously undeclared taxes. This notice is non-discriminatory and purely targets taxpayers deemed to be non-compliant on our i-Tax platform,” Simiyu said. The government through KRA has commenced strategic efforts to boost revenue performance further and mitigate revenue risks from the Covid-19 Pandemic. Revenue enhancement measures currently underway include robust intelligence collection, investigations, and revamping of taxpayers’ audit function. Audit teams have been set up at the KRA Large Taxpayers Office (LTO), Medium Taxpayers Office (MTO), and all Tax Service Offices within Nairobi Region. Audit teams use data to identify compliance risks, develop and implement compliance improvement plans at the sector levels. The audits are leveraging on KRA’s Data Warehousing platform and the Business Intelligence Solution for case management. KRA is also enhancing its debt recovery programme by reducing the outstanding tax portfolio using the debt module in i-Tax and reviewing payment plans. Once full declarations are made and principal tax paid, the taxpayers will enjoy a waiver of interest and penalties.
