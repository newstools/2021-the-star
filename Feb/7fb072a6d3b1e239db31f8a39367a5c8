The council of elders will not allow a clash between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. Unfortunately, we do not know whether they have gone their different ways. None of them has come to tell us. I always attend the National Council of Elders forum where the DP’s community is also represented. In fact, we have a meeting on Friday. We will see whether they will come with something that will back what I am hearing. It is the only way we can get a solution. We should not get to a point where the President and his deputy cannot read from the same script. Both are mature people. They should not give up on peace. Peace is paramount to this nation. We should convince them, if possible, to stick together until the last day of their term. We cannot just give up on them.  We can't say they cannot come together. One of them is working up to August next year when he can then play politics, while the other one seems to be getting late for 2022 campaigns. I think therein lies the difference. But I believe all this can happen without hurting their relationship. So we have as elders planned a meeting for Friday and we hope if there are issues the other side can raise them. But if not, then we cannot jump the gun. We must wait until this issue is brought to the table. That is the difference between the elders and the politicians. We rely on information that is coming from the source, from either of them. But when we hear some people talk about their differences, we think they are talking politics and we cannot take it seriously. So, we are still waiting for any of them to come to us. Last time we visited both of them, including Raila Odinga. The purpose was to tell them to play cool. The chairman of Kikuyu Council of Elders spoke to the Star
