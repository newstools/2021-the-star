Moi Girls High School Eldoret has been shut down indefinitely after students went on strike. The students on Wednesday went on strike demanding the removal of the school principal Christine Chumba. They boycotted classes accusing the principal of harassing them and also mistreating their teachers. Uasin Gishu Director of Education Gitonga Mbaka said the decision had been taken as the ministry looks for a solution to problems raised by the students at the school. The students were ordered to leave today. Police officers and senior education officials were immediately called to the school to monitor the situation at the school. The principal spent the better part of the morning locked up in a meeting with education and security officials. The students had camped at the school gate but they have not been allowed to demonstrate outside the institution. They also claim they have been ignored by the school principal. The students also allege corruption in management at the institution.
