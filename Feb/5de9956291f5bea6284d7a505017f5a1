Gospel singer Gloria Murilo is planning a grand wedding with her new man Evans Sabwami five years after she divorced her ex-husband Pastor Omba. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, Gloria said it is a beautiful thing to love and be loved. "I got engaged and am planning my wedding. I will communicate the details later but for now, I am enjoying the season of love," she said. Evans is an American citizen, a pastor, an engineer and a graphics artist. The 'Narudisha' hit singer shared a photo of her new man, pampering him with love on Valentineâ€™s Day. "Happy Valentine's day to my best friend, the most important man in my life, my heart's safe place, my reason for celebrating this day. I love you, Ev."
