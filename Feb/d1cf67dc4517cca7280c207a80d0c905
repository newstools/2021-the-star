The county government of Busia has unveiled a raft of programmes to improve health services in next financial year. Making a presentation during the County Fiscal Strategy Paper forum at Busia ATC, director of medical services Janerose Ambuchi said top on the priority list is the establishment of a dermatology centre at Alupe Referral Hospital. Ambuchi said the establishment of the multimillion-shilling centre will improve management of skin conditions, noting that the county government of Busia has trained a dermatologist for the task. As another priority, the director said the department will construct canopies and walkways across level four hospitals to improve staff and patient's movement. They will also undertake the upgrading of health centres to level four status starting with Matayos and Amukura. Ambuchi said the department has been allocated Sh2.4 billion as per the strategy paper, but in order to meet development needs they need Sh3.6 billion, thus a shortfall of Sh1.2 billion. "There is a need for adequate budget allocation for installation of radiology equipment at Port Victoria, Sio Port and Nambale subcounty hospitals. Strategic renovation of lower facilities is key in improving service delivery at lower levels," she said. The department is also prioritising the strengthening of blood transfusion services,which is a critical department considering the high maternal and infant mortality rates. The department says there is a need to procure standby generators. Upcoming theatres can't run without generators especially Nambale, Khunyangu and Sio Port. The department also targets investment in preventive programmes covering HIV-Aids, malaria, tuberculosis, Universal Health Coverage, non-communicable diseases, disease surveillance and nutrition, among others.
