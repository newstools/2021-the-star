The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority will ship 8.5 million reusable face masks to schoolchildren in all 47 counties. The authority has already received masks allocation per county from the Health Ministry to protect learners from Covid-19. The masks can be washed and reused. Children younger than six year (PP1 to Grade 1) will receive three million reusable masks. Those aged from six to 12 years (Grade 4 to Standard 8) will receive 2.25 million masks. Those aged 13 (Secondary School) will receive 2.25 million masks. “The distribution team has already identified and mapped the fastest routes to ensure face masks reach children in good time," Kemsa Ag CEO Edward Njoroge said. Njoroge said the first beneficiary was Mwiki Primary School in Kiambu county. The school with the country's highest population received 4,320 masks for 3,991 children. He said 637,407 face masks would be distributed to Nairobi, Murang’a, Kajiado and Kiambu counties given their high prevalence of Covid-19 in February. Nairobi county will receive 34,641 masks for children younger than six years; 57,723 for those between six and 12 years and 48,648 for those aged 13 years and older. Murang’a will receive 39,869 for children younger than six years, 43,980 for children between six and 12 years and 84,003 for those 13 years and older. Kiambu county will receive 90,600 for children younger than six years, 60,914 for those between six and 12 years and 96,469 for those aged 13 years and older. Kajiado will receive 50,936 for children younger than six years, 6,670 for children aged between six and 12 years and 22,954 for those aged 13 years and older Njoroge said Kemsa is working closely with Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry to ensure timely delivery and distribution. Kemsa has received a distribution plan from MoH for the rest of the counties and will ensure prompt distribution, Njoroge said. Kemsa has received partial delivery of 1,348,560 masks for children older than 13, 146,196 masks for those aged six to 12 and 176,400 for children under six from the KNCCI. It expects the rest of the consignment in coming weeks. Kemsa head of distribution Denis Agango said delivery is difficult in rugged terrain with bad or washed-out roads. “Many parts of  the country are experiencing heavy rains and some parts are quite difficult to reach, however, we are doing whatever it takes," Agango said. Education CS George Magoha reusable face masks would be given priority for schools with high enrollment, those in informal settlements and special needs schools. Mwiki Primary School Principal Joseph Kamau expressed his gratitude for selection of the school to launch the programme. (Edited by V. Graham)
