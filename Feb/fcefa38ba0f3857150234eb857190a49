A man who has been trending for allegedly posting Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip and a lady smoking shisha in a city restaurant has pleaded guilty to charges of attempting to extort money. Jones Ochieng Mbolo appeared before Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku on Wednesday. He admitted to threatening to expose on social media platforms videos of Aeedah Pesian Ahmed purportedly taken while contravening the law smoking shisha. Mbolo admitting the facts of the case said that the senator should lead by example and not smoke shisha in public. "The video is trending as I speak on Edgar Obare's platform," Mbolo said. He will remain in custody until March 3 when he will be sentenced.
