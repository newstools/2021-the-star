Tanzanian singer Ibrah is in the country for a media tour. The singer, singed under Harmonize's record label Konde Music Worldwide, is promoting his EP, 'Karata Tatu'. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, the singer said it is his second EP, which has three songs. "In these songs, you get to see what I can do. I have outdone myself, and as I promised my fans good music when I was starting, I think this is just but the beginning," he said. The first song from the EP, 'Nimpende' is already out, which is a love ballad. His first EP is called 'Steps'. Famed for the song 'One Night Stand', Ibraah says it is not based on personal experience. "I was just being creative as an artiste and then Harmonize surprised me by putting a verse," he said.
