Maturity and experience will be key as Mean Machine face Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology(MMUST) in the championship playoff semifinal on Saturday, team manager Wilfred Oyosi has said. The varsity side thrashed Egerton University Wasps 37-0 in the quarterfinal over the weekend and now the team has set sights on beating the western Kenya outfit at their backyard on Saturday and return to the Kenya Cup for the upcoming season. Oyosi noted that having game time under their belt will aid their push against their tough opponents. "It's good we played a game. We were quite rusty in the opening few minutes but once we got into rhythm, we were  are able to create opportunities and score points to put the away beyond our opponents,” added Oyosi Machine outscored their rivals by three tries to one to inch closer to a Kenya cup return after a one-year absence. Oyosi expects Masinde Muliro to be physical in the encounter. “We know they are a physical side, who will batter you upfront and we must be ready for the onslaught,” said Oyosi. "We will come up with a solid game plan to counter the threat they pose. We have very nimble and quick backs and our forwards will need to dominate and create a platform for us to the damage in the backs.” The two sides met last season with Masinde Muliro winning 17-15 but Oyosi says that will count for nothing in this weekend's match. "It was a tight game when we played them last year but that's all in the past. We are focused on the present and we are looking forward to winning,” added Oyosi. The other semifinal will pit championship leaders Strathmore Leos, who will host Northern Suburbs. The two winners on Saturday be promoted to the Kenya Cup, replacing Western Bulls and Kisumu, who have been relegated.
