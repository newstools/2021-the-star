The Nairobi county assembly was a full house on Thursday as MCAs prepared to debate the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 arising from the Building Bridges Initiative. Several politicians were at the assembly to witness the debate, including Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, nominated MP Maina Kamanda, Embakasi East MP Babu Owino and former Gender CAS Rachel Shebesh. A moment of silence was observed in honour of former Wajir Senator Yusuf Haji, who died on Monday. A section of Nairobi residents had on Wednesday poked holes into the BBI Bill. This, as majority of the  MCAs vowed to overwhelmingly pass the bill. Residents drawn from all the 85 wards while attending the public participation forum at Charter hall on Wednesday,  felt that their needs had not been addressed in the bill while majority said they had not accessed copies of the document. So far, eight out of nine counties have passed the BBI bill.
