Kisii Governor James Ongwae has said his administration is committed to completing all the projects he initiated. Speaking to the Star on phone, he said the delay in implementing some projects was a result of failing to get money from the National Treasury on time. “I prioritised some projects since I took office. Some of them have delayed because of inadequate funds,” Ongwae said. He singled out projects like the banana processing factory which has since been completed saying what is remaining is installation. Ongwae said the fire station which is well equipped will help fight fire outbreaks in and outside the CDB. “My administration is moving in the right direction in terms of development. We have done a lot in the last eight years ago,” he said. The county boss asked residents to ignore leaders who are politicking about development saying they are out to gain political mileage. He urged farmers to plant more bananas to enable the factory to have enough to process. Ongwae said he farmers will benefit in terms of finances if they produce more and deliver to the processing plant. “I am urging all banana farmers to increase their production because they will benefit more when the factory starts processing,” he said. Ongwae said middlemen have been reaping more than the farmers by buying their produce at throwaway prices. European Union funded the project to a tune of Sh 110 million and the county government gave Sh 60 million. He said the county produces 350, 000 metric tons of bananas but out of the number 30, 000 tones are sold to Nairobi and other areas at cheap prices. “Farmers have been making loses because of lack of proper market but this will come to an end when the factory starts procession,” Ongwae said. The county boss said the factory will be processing 80, 000 metric tons per day.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
