The affected shops include Bluemax Hardware, Glassmart, Starlight M-Pesa, Imani Chemist and a kerosene pump. The cause of the fire is not yet known. Investigations are going on to established what caused it. Businessman David Ongaro said he was called by a friend at 8pm and informed that his shop was on fire. "I rushed back only to find my shop engulfed in flames," he said. Ongaro said nothing was salvaged from his shop. The business community in the town has urged the county government to establish a fire station within Luanda. Businessman John Mukuna said if there was a fire station in Luanda, destruction would have been minimal.
