DCI detectives based in Bungoma's Cheptais sub-county are probing the suspected murder of a 39-year-old woman who was found dead in her house on Sunday evening. "Suspicion as to the safety of the deceased, Sarah Kimarong, started when her brother's attempt to reach her on phone proved futile, and a visit to her house was met with a padlock to the outside," DCI said. Detectives who acted on the report, broke into the house only to find her body lying undressed in a pool of blood, with signs of strangulation and knee injuries. "As the body of the deceased, who has been working at the Deputy County Commissioner's offices awaits autopsy, detectives have initiated investigations into the appalling incident," DCI added. DCI asked that should anyone have information that may assist in the arrest of the perpetrator(s), to share it by dialing the toll-free hotline number 0800 722 203. Last month, a woman was gang-raped and sodomised then her private parts mutilated in Wataalam area near Ruiru town. The 28-year-old mother of a five-month-old infant arrived late in the area where she had gone to visit a relative.Â She was attacked at about 11 pm. The criminals, after gang-raping her, mutilated her private parts with a sharp object that is suspected to be a knife. They then left her for dead. She also had a deep cut in the forehead. Residents found the woman lying unconscious in a pool of blood on Wednesday morning. She was rushed to a local dispensary for first aid. She was later taken to Ruiru Level 4 Hospital by a community health volunteer identified as Zeitun Adan.
