Socialite Huddah Monroe says she is not in a rush to get a baby. A follower raised the issue during a Q&A segment on Instagram. "When are you planning to have a baby? I mean kuzaa?" Huddah replied, saying, "I have seen this question a million times. Is this yâ€™all biggest dream in life? No achievements? No goals. Babies. Lol! They all come at their own time. No rush." During a past session, she said she has never lightened her skin and has never felt the need. "Do you use any bleaching cremes?" asked a fan. "Y'all wish I bleached, lol. I have never thought about it because my skin is very sensitive," she responded. Huddah's biggest regret is doing a boob job. She almost lost her life undergoing the procedure due to complications, only to break up with the man she did it for.
