The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers has elected new office bearers in Nyamira. During the election, seven out of the 10 branch officials were kicked out. Only three retained their seats. Nyamira High School was the voting venue. Voter turnout was high, a number that has never been experienced before. The election was peaceful and was presided over by Nyamira county election officials. Among the seats that attracted stiff competition was that of the executive secretary and chairman. The incumbents, Lewis Nyakweba and George Makaa respectively, retained their seats, albeit by a thin margin. Nyakweba defeated his closest challenger Joseph Sonye with just 29 votes after garnering 645 votes. Joseph Marigwa, who was also in the race, came a distant third with 385 votes. Makaa retained the chairman's seat with 833 votes. He won by a margin of 12 votes. His closest challenger, Festus Segera, garnered 821 votes. George Ayieko narrowly beat his competitor Philemon Okindo to retain his assistant executive secretary position after garnering 873 votes. Okindo got 750 votes. Evans Matuga, the incoming organising secretary, beat incumbent Cyrus Serembe in a hotly contested race. Matuga garnered 938 while Serembe got 721 votes. Stella Moturi was elected treasurer with 780 votes against incumbent Tom Onsongo, who garnered 755 votes. Matuga said the time has come for teachers' concerns to be addressed with dignity. He said the 'sweep' at the branch office was a sign that teachers were dissatisfied with the outgoing office bearers. "Today'sÂ turn of events is a clear indication that teachers want better services from office bearers. Those who have been elected need to work closely as a team to ensure that there's improved and efficient service delivery to union members who have elected us to office," Matuga said.
