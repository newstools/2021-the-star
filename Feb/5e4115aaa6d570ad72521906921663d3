Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday reiterated his commitment and loyalty to his boss and Jubilee Party leader President Uhuru Kenyatta. Speaking in Isiolo, the Deputy President said that despite claims of rebellion against him, he has been and will continue to respect the President. "Uhuru is the boss in this government. I have never acted in contrast to what he has directed me to do. I have done all that he has instructed me to do," Ruto said. "Even if my duties as Deputy President have been allocated to someone else, I have respected that decision because I want peace." Ruto shifted the blame to ODM for  bringing chaos to Jubilee. "Are they in opposition or in the government? They cannot claim to work with with the government and at the same time say the Jubilee administration has done nothing," he said. This comes after Uhuru  gave his critics an ultimatum to choose  whether they are in or out of his government. After launching a health clinic in Uthiru on Friday, Kenyatta said there was no way his critics conveniently criticise his administration and at the same time take credit for Jubilee's successes. Without mentioning names Kenyatta said: “If you feel the government is good, stay with it. If you keep criticising it, leave and let others continue working.” “Our aim is unity of the people and not to be divided. We want people to pull as one. We want leaders who will cater to issues affecting Kenyans and not divisive politics,” the President said. Allies of the DP have been criticising some decisions made by the Jubilee government. Ruto has himself raised concerns about BBI and promised to not take part in the referendum if it would be divisive.
