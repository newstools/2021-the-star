IG Hillary Mutyambai has directed police commanders to strictly enforce  Covid-19 rules saying there is a lot of laxity. In a statement on Tuesday, Mutyambai said some people have violated the protocols by holding unauthorized gatherings where there is no observance of social distancing or wearing of face masks. He was referring mostly to politicians who have decided to hold rallies without observing the set rules. Observations, backed by photographs, showed most politicians who attended rallies did not wear masks or observe social distancing. "...those willing to hold public gatherings must notify the OCS of such intents at least three days before the proposed date," Mutyambai said. Mutyambai said some businesses and individuals were not observing curfew hours as they were closing past 10pm which is the curfew time. “Members of the public are advised to adhere to the Ministry of Health protocols which include wearing a face mask properly and maintaining a social distance, failure to which necessary legal action may be taken against them,” the statement added. Much has changed since Covid-19 was first reported on March 13, 2020. At that time, the country was scared and thousands lost jobs as the virus that hit the globe came at an enormous economic price. Many Kenyans observed the ministry of health protocols with people being afraid to go outside their houses during the curfew time. This went on until late last year when people started defying the curfew and not putting on masks among other protocols. In his last address, President Uhuru Kenyatta extended the curfew to March 12, and in the same breath banned rallies and other political gatherings. Kenya has far recorded more than 100,000 cases of the disease, with 1,774 cumulative deaths.
