Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has hit back at the Deputy President William Ruto for allegedly creating class wars. Kalonzo said it was unfortunate that the DP was using the hustler narrative to create more divisions among the youth. He was speaking during the first death anniversary of Mzee Daniel Moi at his Kabarak home on Thursday. "I want to remind all of us that Mzee Moi made Ruto who he is. He cannot come up with this dynasty narrative yet he has all along been part of it," he said. "In fact Ruto you were more of a son to Mzee Moi than Gideon. You cannot then antagonise your people by creating class wars because this is radicalising of the youth." Kalonzo said what was witnessed during the burial of the father to Kisii deputy governor Joash Maangi was an embarrassment and a good definition of political stink. Ruto has also been under fire from his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, with the recent one being Uhuruâ€™s controversial suggestion of an end to the Kikuyu-Kalenjin domination of the presidency. Uhuru in his remarks said service with humility is what made Moi who he was. He asked other political leaders to emulate Moi's character and dedicate themselves to service.
