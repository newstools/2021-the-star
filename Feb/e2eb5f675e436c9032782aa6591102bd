Education Cabinet secretary George Magoha has sparked off debate with calls for the re-introduction of corporal punishment in schools (see Pg 9). Magoha argues that the cane will stem runaway indiscipline among students who have "grown horns". "I may appear old school but I think we are at a time when we need to discuss how we can bring sanity in our schools and maybe bring the cane on board once more," Magoha said in Kisii. But his argument — including by those supporting corporal punishment — is not supported by any empirical evidence Studies show corporal punishment has various negative effects on children, among them aggression, antisocial behaviour, physical injury and mental health problems. Yale University psychology professor Alan Kazdin says you cannot punish out behaviours that you do no want The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child issued a directive in 2006 calling physical punishment “legalised violence against children”. In a report by Human Rights Watch, Kenyan educators and psychologists argue that teachers can oversee classrooms and develop their pupils' knowledge, skill, and aptitudes through means other than corporal punishment. They say praising pupils' good behaviour, imposing non-physical punishments, and involving children in making the school rules significantly reduces disciplinary problems. The era of 'spare the rod and spoil the child' is long gone and Magoha, parents and educators must formulate new ways of instilling discipline in children.
