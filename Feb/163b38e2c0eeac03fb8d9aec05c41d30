Award-winning actress Brenda Wairimu has opened up about the drama that takes place behind the scenes that no one ever gets to hear about. In an interview with Word is, Brenda addressed concerns about whether film/TV sets are female-friendly, considering the huge number of complaints about sexual harassment. "It's a very present evil, and sometimes we are forced to put our heads down and take it just so we can continue to put food on the table." She added, "People are slowly and surely getting outed for what they put women and girls through. The only thing remaining is for justice to get served, too." Brenda is currently the star of a popular TV series 'Monica', whose 3rd season is currently streaming on Showmax. Speaking about it, Brenda said, "There are definitely more twists and turns, each character grows and fights bigger demons and battles." She continued, "Monica continues to chase her dreams and bite way more than people think she can chew. Love grows, hearts break, it's an incredible season." Asked if she has plans to move from in front of the camera to behind it in a producer or director role, Brenda said, "I have already produced: 'Disconnect', '18 hours', as well as 'Mommy 101', which aired on Ebru. More will come." Edited by T Jalio
