Two Marsabit county employees and two Ethiopians were charged on Tuesday in a Nairobi court with possessing a firearm and 10 bullets without a licence. County workers Mohammed Galmagar and Ibrahim Galma, and foreign nationals Galma Jara and Musa Dalacha were accused of illegally having an AK-47 gun Simonov carbine. They allegedly committed the offence on February 6, 2021, in Ele Borr area, Turbi subcounty, Marsabit. The four faced a second count of jointly being in possession of 10 bullets calibre 7.62 special. Galmagar is a driver and Galma a mechanic. They denied the charges before Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku. Jara and Musa, however, pleaded guilty to the offence of being in the country illegally on February 6. Their arrest led to a manhunt for a Marsabit MCA whom police alleged was linked to arms dealing suspected to have been used to fuel inter-ethnic clashes in Turbi and Sololo areas. The MCA later surrendered to authorities and was transferred to Nairobi for interrogation by the Anti-Terror Police Unit. The prosecution opposed the release of the two Ethiopians on bail on the grounds that they don’t have a fixed residence and are likely not to attend court proceedings. In an affidavit filed by Anti-Terror Police Unit officer Michael Bundi, they want Jara and Dalacha detained, pending the hearing and determination of the case. According to the police, BPU officers who were on targeted patrol following a tip-off from members of the local community spotted a county government vehicle suspected to have been distributing supplies to bandits in the thickets of Funan Qumbi. Mutuku directed the matter be mentioned before another court for bail application and sentencing of Jara and Musa.
