Media personality Shaffie Weru is giving out Sh20,000 in his new show Happy Hour Bar Quiz on Nikoplay.co.ke. His show starts today at 12 noon. Speaking to Word Is, the Raverend said, "If you want me to pay for your bills, whether it's electricity bill, Valentine plan, any bill that is bothering you right now, you need to register." Adding, "Anybody can win as long as you are smarter than me because its a very simple quiz. It touches on everything: entertainment, gossip, everything that people talk about in the bar." This is a five-second game where the player will be tasked to answer 10 simple questions. "You are not being charged anything, you just need to have a phone. As soon as the quiz ends, you'll have the money immediately," Shaffie said. "Many people will play but the person who will win is one who can beat the clock. "It's everything you kn0w, general knowledge in our daily lives, it is not rocket science. Anybody can answer these questions, even a 10-year-old." Weru says the challenge has been tried and tested, making it possible for the players to win the money. "I'm hoping I could give up to 100K one time, but for a start, we are starting with 20k." This is part of Shaffie Weru's plan to touch people's lives. "I know people are struggling, companies have slashed people's salaries, myself I have a salary cut, so as we wait for people to get back on their feet, it is time for Niko Play to check in, and we get you money on your phone immediately," he said. "For the people who understand what 2020 was, that's why I'm giving out 20k to commemorate 2020, the year." But what's special about this game? "We are not gambling, we are not betting. I am talking about the people who 20k can change their lives and bring a difference in their day-to-day hustle. If you are a hustler, Shaffie is not giving you wheelbarrows, I'm giving you money." So, if you think you can beat the Raverend, then register and play.
