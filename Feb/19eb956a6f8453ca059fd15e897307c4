Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula has urged politicians from Western to support each other and stop name-calling if they really want to ascend to power in 2022. The Bungoma senator said they won't go far or rally the support of Kenyans if they take the slightest opportunity to engage in a war of words. “I urge my brothers and sisters, be it MCAs, MPs or governors, to learn to embrace each other. Let's learn to work together. Let's learn to attract benefits for the people who live in this region," Wetang’ula said. He urged the leaders to stick together saying, “Even if we were 20 per cent of the population of Kenya, and we are divided five times, our aggregate strength will only be four per cent, and we’ll get nowhere.” Wetang’ula quoted a Luhya saying 'If you want to eat liver, then you have to slaughter your own cow'. The senator spoke at the weekend in Kakamega during a BBI sensitisation meeting convened by Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. The legislator asked the Luhya community to support the Building Bridges Initiative. “Knowing very well that President Uhuru Kenyatta is leaving office in 2022, ‘Kiwanja iko wazi’. So my brothers and sisters we must get together and move together. I will play my part, I expect everyone to play their part,” Wetang'ula said. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli, governors Oparanya, Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia), Wycliffe Wangamati (Bungoma), Vihiga's Wilber Ottichilo and their deputies were present. Others included Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa, Kakamega Woman Representative Elsie Muhanda and 270 MCAs from Kakamega, Busia, Bungoma, Vihiga and Trans Nzoia counties.
