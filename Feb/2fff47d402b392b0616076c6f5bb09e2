Agriculture CS Peter Munya has said it is high time that the coffee sector is streamlined in order to allow farmers to benefit from their commodity. Speaking at Ekerenyo grounds on Thursday, Munya gave tough measures aimed at regulating the coffee sector and safe farmers from exploitation by middlemen. "We have experienced cases of farmers paying many interests on small loans they take but the government has reduced the burden and farmers will be dealt with directly not from middlemen," Munya said. The CS later proceeded to Nyamaiya where he addressed coffee farmers. Munya further indicated the government's commitment to revive coffee mills that have not operated for long so that farmers in the Gusii region can take their coffee near to them for milling. "There was a challenge of coffee mills that had not been in function due to some reasons but we as the government will look on this matter and ensure we have the mills back to operation for the better of our farmers," the CS added. Munya was accompanied by the Nyamira County Commissioner Amos Mariba, Nyamira Senator Okong'o Omogeni, Commodities fund Chairman Mwancha Okioma, Senator Omogeni on his side said the farmers need to benefit from the coffee crop and hence said he will follow up on the issues affecting farmers in the county. "Our business as leaders, is to help our farmers to be equal to other farmers in the country, and that is what we will do as leaders," Omogeni said. Nyamira County is among the major producers of tea and coffee in the country and CS Munya said the government will ensure the tea and coffee sector in the region will be improved. "Our attention will be on the farmers who have been producing coffee but have not benefitted from the product. We need to know why other people are getting good payment and yet the first producer of coffee is suffering," Munya noted.
