Much has been said about the many virtues of the late Garissa Senator Yussuf Haji, who had a vast working experience in public service. His strong work ethic, for instance, was a sign that he believed that leadership was more of a responsibility than a title. No wonder his two sons, Abdul and DPP Noordin Haji, revealed to Garissa mourners on Friday that Mzee was very concerned about his inability to serve the people of Garissa when he was bedridden. The sons tearfully narrated how their father contemplated to write to Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka to resign since he felt that he was earning a salary without work for his constituents. The family stated that his six-month salary would now be distributed to the needy schoolgoing children in all the six subcounties in Garissa. Mzee Haji had also requested his sons to pass his immense gratitude to the people of Garissa for their trust and the leadership chance they gave him at the Senate. He also profusely apologised for any shortcomings to his leadership responsibilities, which again showed the seriousness with which he treated the issue of leadership. This is a lesson to young leaders serving in the public sector to always ensure they serve with humility, diligence and not think of using their positions as an instrument of furthering their personal interest and aggrandizement. The attitude that leadership is a place of amassing wealth and fame instead of transforming the lives of those one is mandated to serve is the cancer of our time. It needs to be debunked and replaced with the true ideals and principles of leadership like those that Mzee Haji was roundly praised for by many.
