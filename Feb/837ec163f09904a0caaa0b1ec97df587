The vast Naivasha dumpsite is full and waste is being dumped on farms in Kayole area. Residents fear it will spread disease and pollute overflowing Lake Naivasha Efforts by the Nakuru county government to relocate the dumpsite have failed due to lack of land. Lakeview MCA Simon Wanyoike Wanango said the dumpsite had for years been neglected, leading to its current state. He said feeder roads within the vast site are clogged with waste, making it impossible for traders to access it. “Our biggest fear is that the waste could find its way into Lake Naivasha following the ongoing rains that have hit Naivasha and its environs,” he said. Farmer Danson Kimani said the area is no longer habitable and urged the county government to intervene. He said the only solution is to relocate the dumpsite. “Our children and livestock get sick daily due to this dumpsite. We fear the waste will end up displacing us,” he said. Environment chief officer Muriithi Kiogora said plans were underway to rehabilitate the dumpsite. He admitted here were no immediate plans to relocate it due to lack of appropriate land in Naivasha town. Kiogora said part of the work will include fencing the dumpsite to prevent waste from spilling into residential areas. “We plan to start separating the solid waste at the point of entry as this can be used to produce biogas and fertiliser as we seek land away from the major town,” he told the Star on the phone.
