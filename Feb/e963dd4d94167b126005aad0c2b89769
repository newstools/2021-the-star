Shabana hope to bounce back from last weekend’s 2-1 loss against Kenya Police when they face newbies Soy United on Sunday at Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega. Shabana coach Joseph Ongoro said the loss against Police will not deter them from achieving their season’s objectives of qualifying to the Kenya Premier League. “We want to return to winning ways. the boys are ready and mood in the camp is buoyant. We lost last weekend though unfairly but my focus is now on Soy United,” said Ongoro. The Kisii-based side has so far lost one game under Ongoro, who replaced Vincent Nyaberi, who parted ways with the club. Nyaberi has since joined Murang’a Seals On Saturday, Evans Mafuta’s Silibwet Leons will look to end Kenya Police’s unbeaten record when the teams go head to head at Bomet Stadium. Mafuta has already exuded confidence that he will register his first win as Silibwet head coach. “Since I joined the team,  I have lost one and drew one game. My first win will be against Kenya Police even though I know the game will be tough. We have had good preparations and the boys are set for the game,” added Mafuta. The law enforcers lead the National Super League log with 22 points and remain the only unbeaten team in the league after 10 matches.
