Everything is set, the tents have already been done," he told journalists. He described the late politician as a man who loved peace. "He was a peace-loving leader and in his honor, we will ensure his peaceful send-off," he stated. The change of venue from Nyanturago playing ground in Ibeno, Nyaribari Chache to Gusii Stadium was dictated to by the president and a large number of mourners expected to turn up.
