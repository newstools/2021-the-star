Kenya Morans' Tylor Ongwae was named among the top ten performers players at FIBA Africa AfroBasket qualifiers held in Yaound√©, Cameroon last week. Ongwae, who plies his trade in Denmark for Bakken Bears also had his game-winning basket against former 11 time champions Angola ranked the best shot of the tournament. He hit a buzzer-beater with less than seven seconds left in their 74-73 stunner against the continental powerhouse. "There has been a number of incredible moments in the last window but the Angola vs Kenya game sets itself apart from the other 41 games," FIBA columnist Julio Chitunda wrote. That victory took Kenya to their first AfroBasket for the first time in 28 years. It will also be their fourth appearance with the last one in Nairobi in 1993. Among the top performers are: Tylor Ongwae (Kenya), Carlos Morais (Angola), Allan Dokossi (CAF), Deon Thompson (Ivory Coast) Jordan Sacko (DR Congo), Haytham Khalifa (Egypt), Sadio Doucoure (Mali), Ike Iroegbu (Nigeria), Nuni Omot (South Sudan) and Makrem Ben Romdhane (Tunisia). 16 nations will battle it out in Africa's premiere competition that tips off in Kigali, Rwanda between August 24 and September 5.
