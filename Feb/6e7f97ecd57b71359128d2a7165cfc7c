Young players have a chance to join Malkia Strikers 2020 Tokyo Olympics training camp from March 1, team manager Alfred Chedotum has said. Five players will be selected to join the Mercy Moim-captained side during the second leg of the Kenya Volleyball Federation league this weekend at Nyayo Stadium. Prior to the Covid-19 enforced break, 20 players had been drafted for training. Chedotum, who is also the Kenya Defence Forces team manager, said they are keen to inject young blood to the star-studded side for them to gain experience which is good for the growth of the national team. The team is expected to report for a two-week residential training camp at Moi Stadium, Kasarani next month. "We've had discussions in regard to the upcoming players. Through coach Paul Bitok, we want to mentor our young players, who have already shown promising signs, to be the stars of tomorrow. The remaining slots will be for them as we beef up the squad." Selection will be based on departments with positions up for grabs in blocking, spiking, reception and service. "An average player on any of these sections stands a big chance," observed Chedotum, who expressed mixed feelings about the Women's African Volleyball Club Championship in April. "The club championship will be a big interruption to our plans because of the stoppages.Â  We would like to perfectly bond as a team but the players will be allowed to join their various clubs for the event," said Chedotum. "On the positive side, however, competing with the best teams on the continent gives the players the opportunity to gauge their readiness for the Olympic Games." Once players have joined camp, no one will be allowed to leave as a safety precaution against Covid-19. "We are behind schedule as our opponents have been working. The earlier the players settle the better," he added.
