An assistant chief who passed away one week after the death of her son was on Tuesday laid to rest in Gitithia village, Lari subcounty, Kiambu. Tabitha Wangare, the assistant chief of California in Kamukunji, Nairobi, was praised for her hard work, dedication and good relations with the people. Kamukunji deputy county commissioner Samuel Kariuki told mourners that a lot of people travelled to her rural home because of the respect they had for her. She was also generous and cared for her people, Kariuki said. "We have lost an important person. That's why you all see we have attended this burial here in Lari," he said. Kariuki urged the junior administrators to emulate Wangare by working hard and leaving lasting legacies. He also appealed to residents to support the chiefs and their assistants, so they can continue serving them with dedication. California Nyumba Kumi chairman Simon Muturi, on behalf of the Kamukunji subcounty said: "She was an all round person. Nairobi is a metropolitan area. She served all people equally regardless of tribe, race, religion and sex. We have heard people being discriminated elsewhere, but she was not of that type." Wangare's son, Robinson Gitachu, was buried on January 24.Â After her son's burial, she suffered a heart attack and was taken to Kenyatta National Hospital where she died on February 1. Kariuki praised chiefs from Nairobi for attending the funeral, urging them not to stay long before visiting the family. He also thanked Lari administrators, including Gitithia chief Samuel Kahoro and assistant chiefs Peter Mbugua (Lare), Alice Gitau (Gitithia) and Gladwell Mugo (Nyambare), for assisting their Nairobi counterparts to ensure Wangare gets a befitting sendoff. Nairobi regional coordinator James Kianda said Wangare will be remembered for her dedication to serve. In tributes paid on his behalf by Kariuki, Kianda said the government had lost an important officer.
