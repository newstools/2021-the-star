A Form Four student has been arrested for attacking and killing his father in Bungoma's Khayinga village. According to a statement by the Directorate of Criminal Investigation,  the 45-year-old father, a local Jua Kali artisan, had gone to his son's house to enquire on his habitual absenteeism from school, only to find him enjoying a romantic moment with a lady. "Enraged at the father's intrusion, the 21-year-old suspect landed on him with blows and kicks, before inflicting deep cuts on his head and arms with a machete," the DCI said in a statement. Members of the public who responded to the victim's wails were too late to save him, as he had profusely bled, succumbing to his injuries. The alleged assailant took off, disappearing from the infuriated mob. He went into hiding at a friend's house from where he was arrested and is being processed for arraignment. This comes weeks after a chilling incident where a son confessed to killing four family members and a mason in Kiambu. The son identified as Lawrence Simon Warunge confessed he committed the cold blood incident. The 23-year-old university IT student was arrested as a prime suspect into the incident after a three-day manhunt. Police said they arrested the son  after he went missing when his parents, two brothers and a worker were brutally murdered at their home in Kiambaa Constituency, Kiambu county. After he was arrested, he later confessed to the incident and led police to a residence in Mai Mahiu area on Saturday where they recovered the killer weapon- a kitchen knife-, clothes, shoes and a piece of paper.
