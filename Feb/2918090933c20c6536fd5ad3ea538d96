Angry residents barricaded the busy Olenguruone-Molo road to protest insecurity in Keringet Centre, Kuresoi Constituency. Trouble started on Tuesday morning when a man suspected to have killed a fellow village mate was found drinking at a local pub in the township. The suspect who poses as a security guard at one of the alcohol drinking joints is alleged to have killed a 31-year-old man on Monday night. Police had to lob tear-gas canisters and shoot in the air to disperse the stone-throwing mobs who had also lit bonfires on the road. Businesses at the township were closed as locals engaged the police in running battles. Besides lighting fires on the road, the residents used heavy boulders to block it forcing most vehicles to look for alternative routes. They stoned a police vehicle ferrying the suspect and uprooted a billboard belonging to Keringet Police Station. "The officers here have become complacent, some of the own bars which remain open throughout the day despite the despite the curfew," Stephen Cheruiyot, a local said. He said the suspect was found in one of the pubs with blood-stained clothes. The police managed to save the suspect from locals who were baying for his blood. Tension is still high at the township and the road was closed by the time of going to press.
