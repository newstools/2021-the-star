Former State Minister of Defense Gen. Sheikh Yusuf Inda Adde has declared the government of Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo as illegitimate. According to the news broadcasted by one of the leading media houses in Somalia, Yusuf has taken control of the monument of the Unknown Soldier in the Somalia capital Mogadishu. Radio Dalsan reported that Yusuf has also taken over the SNA forces loyal to him. The one term of Farmajo came to an end on Monday, February 8, 2021. Yusuf had defected on n May 17, 2009, to the Transitional Federal Government and was later appointed Minister of Defense. He resigned from the position as minister on June 17,  2010, and started his own faction after claiming the government didn't keep to its agreements. The central government and federal states of Somalia had until February 5, 2021, to seal the deal ahead of the election. Following the stalemate, Somalia is likely to miss the February 8 deadline for choosing a new president. The United Nations and the AU top leaders had called upon Somali leaders to go back to the table in search of an agreement over elections. On Tuesday, both UN secretary general Antonio Guterres and African Union Commission (AUC) chairperson Moussa Faki commended the people and leaders of Somalia for progress achieved in recent years towards the stabilisation of the country. The duo said the “hard-won gains are a testimony to the firm determination of the people of Somalia towards lasting peace and prosperity, following decades of instability.”
