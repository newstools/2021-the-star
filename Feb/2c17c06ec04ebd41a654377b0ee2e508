About 16,000 vulnerable families unable to pay water bills because of the Covid-19 pandemic will get free water. The Kisumu county government and Oxfam International will pay their bills after the beneficiaries are identified. It was not known for how long the bills would be paid. Deputy Governor Mathews Owili said the programme targets the urban poor. “These will be people unable to pay water bills. They might have been disconnected,” Owili said. County water executive Salmon Orimba will liaise with Kiwasco MD  Thomas Odongo to ensure needy households are connected. He spoke when Kisumu Water and Sanitation Company (Kiwasco) launched a Sh2 million call centre to improve services. The call centre number is 0575 007 000. It will be open 24-7. The company also launched a USSD code *483*86# to enable customers to check their bills. Odongo said the call centre will reduce the number of people visiting offices to avoid crowding, in line with Covid-19 safety protocols. Under the five-year support programme, Owili said, schools in need will be supported. Owili urged the Kiwasco to help vulnerable customers through corporate social responsibility activities. “If you have a children’s home that you’re supplying with water and maybe they have not paid the bills, then you can support them,” he said. Owili, who presided over the call centre launch, praised the company for being steadfast in service delivery. He said paying the water bills of the needy was part of the county's development agenda to ensure residents have access to clean, affordable and potable water. He said the county has partnered with an NGO to expand water supply to 80 per cent of the population in Nyakach; works are ongoing. (Edited by V. Graham)
