The South African variant of Covid is in Kenya (see P10). Yet politicians are busy campaigning with minimal protection against the virus. Around 7,000 people attended last weekend's four-day event at Sagana Lodge with President Uhuru Kenyatta. Most wore masks, often not covering the nose and mouth, but there was little social distancing. Few people wore masks in the crowds during Deputy President William Ruto's prayer visit to Narok last weekend. Two MPs fought without masks at the burial of Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi's father on Monday. Few masks are in sight as the Wiper candidate Agnes Kavindu campaigns in Machakos for the Senate by-election. What message are our politicians sending us? That we do not need to worry about Covid? Or that events with more than 200 people are OK if we consider them of great importance? Kenya plans to vaccinate 1.25 million people before June but we will not be secure until the whole country is protected. Until then politicians should behave more responsibly and cut back on crowded events, even if they are outdoors. And they should keep reminding citizens to wear masks, wash their hands and maintain safe social distancing. Quote of the day: "I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong."
