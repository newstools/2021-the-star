Police in Kisii have arrested Deputy Governor Joash Maangi. He was arrested at Kisii High School on Monday morning as he waited to welcome Deputy President William Ruto. Ruto is at the burial of Gusii politician Simeon Nyachae alongside President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. An aide said detectives ordered Maangi to enter their car before they sped off to the DCI offices in Kisii town where they are grilling him. "We don't know why they arrested him. They did not give a reason why they were picking him for, they only told him to enter their car before they left to Central Police Station where they are interrogating him," said an aide. Police officers also picked South Mugirango MP, Sylvanus Osoro, also a vocal DP Ruto ally from the funeral for interrogation. He was lured out of the tent at Gusii Stadium by plain cloth detectives and whisked away from Gusii Stadium at 11.20 am as the funeral service for the Kisii Politician Simeon got underway. Police have not given the reason for the arrests of both Osoro and Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi. "Your guess is good as mine, thru just told me to come out and accompany them to the station," said the Tangatanga legislator as he was ferried to an awaiting van. There were muted protests at the gate as he was whisked away was taken to the DCI offices. County Police Commander Jebel Munene could not be reached by phone as his phone remained off. The arrest of the Deputy Governor comes a day after a former ODM branch executive Samuel Omwando was arrested from his house in Nyanchwa. Maangi had in an interview with the Star condemned the arrest of the former ODM operative who is currently DP William Ruto supporter. Supporters said the government was using state machinery to muzzle supporters of the Deputy President. Maangi is the chair of Tangatanga wing in Kisii.
