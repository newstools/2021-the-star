Police in Mbeere are investigating an incident in which a man killed his wife and two children. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations said the woman was aged 28 while the children were nine and five respectively. The incident happened on Sunday morning. The suspect locked himself in his house in Kiamukuyu area before he executed the victims. The local assistant chief called police to inform them of the murder after he had been informed of the same by villagers. The motive of the murders is yet to be established, said Eastern Region head of DCI Jeremiah Ikiao. “Unfortunately, by the time of their arrival, the suspect had wiped out his entire family in the most despicable manner, by hitting their foreheads using a sledge hammer. The murder weapon was recovered and the suspect arrested, as detectives try to establish the motive of the killings,” the DCI said. The bodies were later moved to the mortuary. This is the latest murder to be reported in a series that have been ongoing in the recent past.
