There was drama at the Nairobi Hospital when police arrived and picked up former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko for the ruling of his assault case. Sonko had been admitted to the hospital on Monday night after complaining of stomach complications and high blood pressure while at the Gigiri police cells. Ahead of the court session, police were informed the former governor was at the hospital. They drove there and picked him up and took him to the court at around 11.15 am. It is not clear if the doctors at the hospital cleared the transfer given he had been there for more than six hours. Witnesses said the hospital management avoided any drama and allowed him to be taken away. He appeared in court in the company of an ambulance medic. This came ahead of his two key rulings in court on if he should be released on bond. On Tuesday, a Kiambu Magistrateâ€™s court is first expected to rule on his application to be released on bond in a multiple case of assault and robbery he is facing. A Kahawa West court is also expected to make a ruling on an application by the police to be allowed to detain Sonko for 30 days as they investigate terror-related charges.
