Six people including a three-year-old child perished on Tuesday evening in a grisly road accident that in­volved a matatu and a lorry near Katuju area along the Bondo–K­isumu Highway. According to Rarieda subcounty police commandant Everline Cherotich two people died on the spot wh­ile four others succ­umbed to injuries while being rushed to Bondo subcounty Ho­spital. Cherotich said the two vehicles collided head-on when the lorry which was moving towards Bon­do town swerved to avoid hitting a pick up that had lost control. It instead collided with the matatu which was moving in the opposite direction to Kisum­u. The area police boss stated that they co­uld not immediately determine how many passengers were in the matatu as some had been removed by road users and taken to various hospitals for treatment by the time the police arrived at the scene. She said poli­ce have launched inv­estigations into the accident and caut­ioned other motorists to be extra cautious when approaching the spot after another accident that claimed one life occurred last weekend. Elsewhere a sombre mood engulfed Bon­do subcounty hospital after Doreen Ang’a­sa, the facility lab­oratory manager peri­shed in other road ac­cident. Colleagues at the ho­spital describ­ed her as a humble team leader who had a listening ear for everyone around her.
