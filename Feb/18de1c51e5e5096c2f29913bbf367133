Kirinyaga county government has pledged to fund additional 45 poultry groups that it promised to incorporate under the second phase of Wezesha  poultry farming. This will bring to 77 the total poultry groups under the initiative spread across various wards in the county. Governor Anne Waiguru said as a way of improving the project, her administration will  ensure farmers get more improved chicken breed that are more resistant to disease. Waiguru said the additional groups will play a vital role towards revolutionising  the project thus empowering farmers. She spoke on Thursday after making an impromptu visit to Mkulima Bora poultry farm in Ndia, which is one of the 32 poultry clusters founded under the phase one of the Wezesha initiative. The groups were supplied with 1,200 layer chicks per group and have now become self -reliant close to an year on since the inception  of the project. Members are now able to sell eggs through the help of the county government. Titus Maina, the chair of the 32 chicken clusters, hailed the project for it’s transformative agenda, saying they look forward to it being a mega initiative that will put Kirinyaga on the map for its huge egg supply in the region and the country. Waiguru urged locals to continue supporting the county government in improving livelihoods  through various farming projects. “We have initiated so many progressive projects .Under Wezesha, we are in the process of also putting up an avocado plant in Kanyeki-ini and a tomato processing plant in Kangai ward. These are the kind of projects that  will help improve our children lives as opposed to being supplied with wheelbarrows,” she said. Waiguru also said the county government has also embarked on a pig rearing project under which a pilot project has been initiated. It will involve 20 groups that will be supported with free piglets and pig feeds. A modern slaughter house will be established to cater for pig processing, she said.
