UNCTAD boss and former Trade minister Mukhisa Kituyi has challenged country's politicians to avoid insults and play clean politics ahead of 2022 polls. The former cabinet minister said it is possible for politicians to differ respectfully and not resort to insults as has been the case. "I want to say that it is possible in Kenya for politicians to differ without resorting to insults and name calling," Mukhisa said. He was speaking during a thanksgiving prayer service at Makadara Friends Church. He asked for prayers for what he termed a challenging task ahead. Mukhisa landed at Jono Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) on Sunday morning to arousing welcome by family, friends and supporters. He will later in the afternoon address a press conference in Nairobi where he is expected to make public his 2022 candidature. He was accompanied by Kisumu politician Atieno Otieno and veteran journalist David Makali who heads his campaign organising committee. Also present at the Makadara church was Nairobi politician Stanley Livondo.
