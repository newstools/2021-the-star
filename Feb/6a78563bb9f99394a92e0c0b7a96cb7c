Vera Sidika's hubby Brown Mauzo has unleashed a Valentine’s song dedicated to her. In a part of the lyrics, Mauzo confirms he is, indeed, married to the socialite. "Penzi lako mizani halipiki. Wife material sio kiki... Nobody like you." In October last year, Vera revealed the details of their wedding through her Instagram page, where she shared a gorgeous picture of the two. "I got married to my best friend. I love you so much my Husband @brownmauzo254," she captioned it. The two are reported to have gotten married in Mombasa at the Attorney General’s office. A close source told Word Is some of his friends did not attend the ceremony since they were at loggerheads over how he has been conducting business ever since he met Vera.
