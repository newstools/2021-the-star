Striking clinical officers have returned to work in Kajiado county. They returned to work on Tuesday after reaching an agreement on Monday. Striking nurses and doctors already have returned to work. Nurses and clinical officers went on strike on December 7. Services were paralysed in all county health facilites that already had been hit by a drug shortage. Clinicians called off the strike after marathon meetings between union officials and county government officials. The clinical officers demanded payment of arrears, better allowances, promotions and adequate supply of quality PPEs as they handle Covid-19 patients. The return-to-work formula was announced on Monday at county headquarters. Present were county secretary Francis Sakuda, health services CEC Esther Somoire and Kenya Union of Clinical Officers (Ä¶uko) officials led by Kajiado branch chairman Victor Kuntai. "We have hammered out a favourable return-to-work formula covering working conditions, promotions, personal protective equipment and salaries," Kuntai said. He added, "We thank the governor and his officials for giving us a hearing and agreeing to address our grievances." Kuntai then announced, "We have now called off the strike with immediate effect. We are instructing all the clinical officers to be back to work within the next 24 hours." Health CEC Somoire, joined by county attorney Augustine Sekeyian, announced the release of officers' January salaries, which had been withheld. "We shall also not victimise any officer who missed duty during the period of the strike," Somoire said.  (Edited by V. Graham)
