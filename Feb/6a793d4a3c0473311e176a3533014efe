The Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organisation has started a training programme on pigeon pea value chain for extension staffs, service providers and lead farmers from Machakos. Director general Eliud Kireger said the Machakos government prioritised promotion of the crop to reduce poverty among its people. He said the expected results are increased incomes and improved food and nutritional security, especially for women, children, youths and vulnerable groups. He said the extension staff, service providers and lead farmers will be expected to develop their respective subcounty workplans. Pigeon pea is one of the eight crop value chains being supported under the KCSAP project since it is recognised as one of the climate smart cereal crops. Pigeon pea, or Mbaazi in Kiswahili, is the third most widely grown crop in Kenya. It grows in semi-arid regions, which are characterised by little rainfall and high temperatures. It does well in altitude of 0-2,000m above sea level, rainfall ranging from 600-1,000mm per annum, temperature of 18-38 °C and in well drained deep soils with Ph ranging from  5.0-7.0. Kireger said it is a dual purpose crop, used as both livestock feed and human food. The crop was identified as a priority crop by one (Machakos) out of 24 counties participating in the KCSAP Project. “This is why Kalro is making concerted efforts to promote and disseminate technologies, which include superior Kalro pigeon pea varieties, Mbaazi 1, Mbaazi 2, Mbaazi 3, KAT 68/8, KAT 81/3/3 and KAT 777 that have drought and pets tolerance characteristics,” Kireger said. He said there is need to enhance the crop's productivity locally as it holds the key to ensuring food sufficiency. Pigeon pea is largely cultivated in Ukambani and Coast. Kireger said farmers only harvest about two bags per acre against a potential of 10 bags. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
