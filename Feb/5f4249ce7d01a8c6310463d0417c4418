A 161-bed dormitory has completely been gutted by fire at Moi Boys High School in Nyatike, Migori, in suspected arson. No student was injured during the inferno that started around 9pm on Monday as they were still on night preps, principal Stephen Auka said. He said nothing was rescued, including students' belongings and furniture. “We were unable to rescue anything however much we tried before the fire brigade team arrived. The whole dormitory had caught fire within five minutes,” Auka said. He said property worth millions went up in flames in the dormitory that mostly housed Form 4 students. "We can no longer use the building since it looks weak following the inferno,” he said. The cause of the fire has, however, not been established. The principal said they had informed the police who will lead investigations. Last week, Education CS George Magoha said parents should prepare to pay for every school property destroyed in fires caused by students unrest. At least 15 schools have reported fire incidents and student unrest, including Itigo Girls in Nandi county, Itierio Boys in Kisii county, Kisumu Boys. Learning resumed on January 4 following the end of a 10-month holiday due to coronavirus outbreak in the country.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
