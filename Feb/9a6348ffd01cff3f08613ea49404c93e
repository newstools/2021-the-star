Kenya Ports Authority will go-to camp on Monday to start preparations for next month’s FIBA Africa Women’s Club Championships slated for Cairo, Egypt. Head coach Anthony Ojukwu said he wants to put up a strong team by blending youth and experience. He revealed that the results from the pre-season tournament in Nairobi over the weekend leaves no doubt that the team prospects are good. “I was very impressed with what I saw from my players during the pre-season event in Nairobi. The team is good and just needs a little polishing,” he said. He noted that the young talent he recruited to the team have showed remarkable improvement within a short time and that they can only get better. “Medina Okot, Yvonne Atieno and Babra Diana were superb throughout the tourney and with a little bit of polishing, they are the players to watch. I have only worked with the youngsters for a few weeks but what I saw leaves no doubt that the future is bright.” KPA entered two teams for the pre-season event, one comprising the youth and the other boosting experienced players with new the recruits carrying the day with 40-38 win. He said the porters will open their league campaign at home before travelling to Nairobi a week later. The team, he predicted, will have a good season at the local front, citing champions Equity Bank as the only tough opponent. KPA and national champions Equity Bank will represent the country in the club show that is slated tip off on March 10-18.
