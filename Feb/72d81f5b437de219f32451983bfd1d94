President Uhuru Kenyatta’s promise to give MCAs a Sh2 million car grant ahead of a crucial debate on the Constitutional Amendment Bill is ill-advised, an activist has said. Kisii County Governance Watch secretary Rachael Otundo said all Kenyans should get a chance to either endorse the report or reject it based on how it will affect their lives. “It is wrong for the President to promise MCAs a Sh2 million car grant if they support the BBI report,” Otundo told the Star in her office. The activist urged the leaders to put their interest aside and scrutinise the document before passing it. “There is a need for the leaders to critically analyse the BBI report before they make a decision in endorsing it,” she said. On 2022 elections, Otundo said Kenyans will vote a president based on his manifesto and agenda and not on political debt. She termed it hypocritical for ODM chief Raila Odinga to claim that people of Mt Kenya owe him a political debt. “The people of Mt Kenya feel that they had the first president and thus they hold economic stake in the country,” Otundo told the press. Otundo, who hopes to be Kisii governor in 2022, said all people want a president who will protect their political and economic interests.
