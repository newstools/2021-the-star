The government should assign counsellors to all basic learning institutions to manage learners' psychological stress and help reduce violence and arson. That's what a Kenya National Union of Teachers official has said. At least 32 fires, mostly arson, as well as riots have broken out countrywide since schools reopened in January after nine-month Covid-19 closure. Five schools in Bomet have been set ablaze since January. Arrests have been made but no one has yet been taken to court. Educators held a crisis meeting on Wednesday in Bomet where five fires have broken since January. Another will be held on Friday on arresting the violence and arson. Lack of discipline, stress, difficulty adjusting, drug abuse, transfer of teachers, Covid strictures and fear of exams are blamed. Knut Bomet branch executive secretary Malel Langat attributed rising unrest in schools to depression. He said the only way to curb it is for the TSC to ensure functional counselling departments in all schools with qualified staff. He said some students may be undergoing mental instability and trauma on returning after nine months away from school order and stability. Qualified counsellors can help the students and prevent their acting out, he said. Langat blamed poor relationships between boarding students and teachers for many of the rampages and arson attacks. “Peer influences can make children develop bad attitudes leading them to commit evil deeds while in school...when we have such tutors, we are sure their issues can be easily nipped in the bud,” he said. Speaking to the Star in Bomet, the official argued, “We should have a full department in every school with particular staff whose work is well defined, unlike nowadays where guidance and counseling is just a topic." He also said religious studies should be brought back and made compulsory from primary to the university as it helps instil spirituality and good behaviour. (Edited by V. Graham)
