Despite their heartbreaking exit from the Caf Confederation Cup and an impending investigation by Caf over their confrontation of match officials during their 2-2 draw against NAPSA that consigned them to an aggregate defeat, Gor Mahia have received US$5,000 from convalescing former Nairobi governor Mike Sonko. Sonko, in an audio recording, urged Gor chairman Ambrose Reacher to pass his regards to the players for their gallant effort that saw them come to within a couple of minutes of reaching the group stages of Africa’s secondary club cup competition. “I was informed that the players were stranded wherever they were and as a friend of the team, I sent US$5,000 which I hope you have received,” said Sonko while supposedly speaking to Rachier in the unverified audio. “The players tried their best despite the result and we have to acknowledge them and hope for the better,” added Sonko who was speaking in Kiswahili. “If there are any further challenges, don’t hesitate to call me,” finished Sonko who is admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital. Rachier acknowledged that the money had reached him and wished the governor quick recovery. Gor inspite of their multimillion shillings sponsorship deal with Betsafe and the grants received from Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Premier League sponsors have faced financial challenges so much so that the club travelled to Zambia on the very day they took to the field against NAPSA.
