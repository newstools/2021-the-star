The eviction from the Hustler mansion is loading, Jubilee Vice Chair David Murathe has claimed. "There will be an eviction party from the hustler mansion in Karen. ..it is loading.. however it happens, they are getting out!" Murathe said. Speaking during an interview with KTN on Thursday night, Murathe said Deputy President William Ruto and his Hustler team are not used to 'team play'. "When you form a team, it does not matter who becomes the lead. One has to become the captain but the most important thing is to become a member of the team," he said. Murathe said Kenya can only have one candidate as a president. He said this can happen with Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, ODM's Raila Odinga or ANC's Musalia Mudavadi. "The most important is the team and I can assure you that there will be a meeting between the National Assembly and the Senate," he said. When contacted for initial reaction to the remarks, Ruto's team asked that Murathe clarifies his claims. "We don't know where the push is coming from, unless Murathe clarifies," Emmanuel Talam told the Star on the phone. Murathe's claims come days after allies of Ruto accused President Uhuru Kenyatta of spearheading a scheme to force his deputy to resign from government. The DP's confidants alleged that they were aware of a plan to render him jobless by assigning his roles to someone else. The DP last Saturday stirred a storm when he alleged that, despite his contribution to Uhuru's victory in 2013 and 2017, a scheme was afoot to elbow him out of government. "There are people plotting to push me out of the government. When we formed this government, President Kenyatta was with me or with the political conmen that are with him?‚Äù Ruto asked a charged crowd in Kabarnet on Saturday. His remarks came just a week after the President dared him to leave government if he is dissatisfied.
