South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has yet again demonstrated his efforts in fighting coronavirus by taking the Covid-19 vaccine. Ramaphosa took the vaccine on Wednesday and called upon leaders in various sectors and parts of the country to lead by example and get the vaccine publicly. “We have called on leaders in various sectors and parts of the country to lead by example and get inoculated publicly. We will therefore witness some Premiers, MECs, and leaders from civil society, religious formations, and traditional leadership being vaccinated in all provinces,” Ramaphosa said. He said that through the vaccination programme, his government aims to achieve population immunity to save lives and protect livelihoods. “We have chosen vaccination and we call on all South Africans to choose vaccination and protect one another.” Ramaphosa announced on Wednesday that the first batch of 80 000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was ready for distribution across the country. “To demonstrate our confidence in this vaccine and help allay any fears that people may have, the Minister of Health and I will join the first health care workers to receive the vaccine in Khayelitsha.”
