The Kenya Tea Development Agency will train smallholder tea farmers to make sanitiser, soap and masks. The KTDA Foundation, KTDA Management Services and Greenland Fedha have partnered to train 30 farmers from each of the 12 factories identified for the initiative. Through the support of a 100 million Euros (Sh13.1 billion) grant from the Entrepreneurial Development Bank of Netherlands, the farmers will be trained and given seed money for the project, said Greenland Fedha general manager Anne Gathuku. The farmers will sell their products to factories, which will in turn distribute them to their clients. “We want to ensure that there is continuity in the programme because the products will be Kenya Bureau of Standards compliant,” she added. Gathuku spoke at Nyansiongo Tea Factory in Borabu, Nyamira county, on Friday. She distributed face masks and hand-washing stations to farmers and tea-buying centres. She also handed face masks and hand-washing stations to farmers at Nyamache Tea Factory. Each factory received 3, 000 masks and 50 hand-washing stations. “This is part of our programme to enhance awareness on Covid-19 to smallholder tea farmers and communities living around KTDA-managed factories. What we are doing here is part of the many initiatives by KTDA to protect farmers from Covid-19, which has ravaged the country,” Gathuku said. Nyamira KTDA board member Wilfred Nyakundi, Nyansiongo factory chairman Patroba Mochama, regional manager Peter Kinyua and Nyansiongo factory unit manager Winstone Njeru were present. Nyakundi and Mochama welcomed the initiative and petitioned Greenland Fedha to add more masks and hand-washing stations to cushion more farmers from the Covid-19 pandemic. The program targets about 118, 000 tea farmers across the 12 KTDA factories zones with various initiatives such as water sanitization and hygiene services. The program will run for six months.
