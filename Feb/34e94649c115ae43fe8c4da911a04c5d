Police in Lari will detain for 10 days an ECDE teacher suspected of killing a Standard 6 pupil in Kiambu county. Maryanne Nyambura was arraigned on Monday and detective Collins Otieno attached to Lari DCI office asked the court to give police 14 days to finalise investigations. The court gave them 10 days. Otieno told Limuru resident magistrate Fred Koome that Nyambura allegedly caused the death of Mary Wambui between February 1 and February 5, at Gitithia Primary School in Lari subcounty. He told the magistrate that they needed to take Nyambura to Mathari Hospital for a psychiatrist test and record statements. Otieno said Nyambura was arrested on February 18 and urged the court to allow them to detain her until they finalise investigations. Koome declined to give the police 14 days to complete investigations, saying the suspect had overstayed in their custody. She reduced the period by four days. The case will be mentioned on March 4 when the court will give more directions. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
