Internal Auditors in the public sector have been urged to uphold professionalism and integrity in their work in order to add value to their respective organizations. Speaking during the Busia County Internal Auditors Quarterly meeting held at the Busia Agricultural Training Centre, Busia County Audit Committee Chairman, CPA George Otieno advised auditors to be more pro-active in their work by offering timely and informed advisory services to accounting officers to ensure achievement of organizational objectives. He thanked the team for their improved productivity and assured them of Audit Committee’s support. He urged them to continually build their skills and knowledge through continuous professional development, trainings, research and peer consulting. The county government recently recruited more internal auditors who have since been deployed to various County Departments. Internal Auditors are tasked with the provision of independent, objective assurance and consulting services to accounting officers by bringing in a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. On her part, Chief Officer Economic Planning, Joy Wanga, reiterated county government’s commitment in strengthening internal controls systems in place with the Directorate of Internal Audit playing a critical role. She promised to champion for more training and exposure opportunities aimed at empowering and building skill capacities of the auditors. The auditors, led by Chief Internal Auditor Zadok Koech, thanked the management for its goodwill and requested the Directorate to be considered with more resources in terms of office space, working tools and training opportunities to enable them achieve their mandate.
