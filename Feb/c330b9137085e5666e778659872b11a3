A man who impersonated a KDF officer at the Lang’ata Barracks has pleaded guilty to the charges and told court that he did so because he badly needed a military job. Daniel Prince Maina pleaded guilty before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa on Friday, saying he had tried to get the KDF job several times but without success. The charge sheet said the accused committed the offence on February 17 at Lang’ata Barracks gate in Lang’ata subcounty, Nairobi county. He impersonated Lieutenant Daniel Maina and wanted to get entry into the barracks. Prosecutor Robert Ogallo said the military officers at the station got suspicious of the suspect after he presented himself as the officer and upon investigations, they found out that the credentials belonged to another officer. They reported the matter to Lang’ata police station which led to his arrest and arraignment. Kitagwa directed that the matter be mentioned on Monday for further directions.
