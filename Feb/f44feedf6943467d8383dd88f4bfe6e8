Sandrafelis Chebet and Naibei Kiplimo stole the limelight at the Athletics Kenya Nairobi Region Cross Country Championships after winning the senior women and men’s 10km races respectively. Embakasi’s Kiplimo clocked 30:04.77 ahead of Peter Mwaniki (30:09.42) and Shadrack Masai (30:14.05). “The conditions were just perfect for me today compared to last time when I competed at the regional championships. The course was flat and the cool weather allowed me to put my best performance,” Kiplimo said. He has set his eyes on next weekend’s National Cross Country Championships at Ngong Racecourse where he has promised a titanic battle against the favourites. “I know that I have the pedigree to compete against the likes of Geoffrey Kamworor and Kibiwott Kandie. It will not be easy but I will push to the limit,” he said. Londiani-based Chebet set an unassailable lead over compatriot Emily Chebet to cross the finish line in 33:48.5. Emily timed 35:07.8 for second while Margaret Nduta came third in 35:41.6. Chebet was elated and relieved after a disappointing ninth-place finish at last weekend’s Discovery Kenya Cross Country in Eldoret. “Last weekend I finished ninth while today I managed to win the race.  I can only give glory to God for the victory for it is not easy to achieve such a feat. I know that tougher opponents await at the national level but that only motivates me to work harder,” Chebet said. In the men’s under-20 8km race,  Victor Chepkwony overcame compatriot Jackson Kikana to clinch the title in 24:42.3. Kikana timed 25:00.0 to finish second ahead of Onesmus Gitau (25:50.3). The Rongai-based Chepkwony stated his intentions of making up for his misfortunes in 2018 when he missed out on Team Kenya to Africa under-18 championships in Ivory Coast. “My ultimate aim is to represent the country at this year’s under-20 championships at Kasarani and hopefully win a medal in 5,000m.  I know it will not be easy but I will continue training to improve on my endurance and speed,” he said. In the curtain raiser race, Mirriam Chemutai (17:17.3) beat Fancy Chepkorir (17:22.7) to win the girls’ under-18 5km race. Sharon Chepkemei finished third in 17:40.9. Peter Kibue timed 19:10.1 to beat Peter Kamau (20:15.9) and Felix Kiprotich (21:59.6) to the boys’ under-18 6km race. Triza Cherotich from Lemotit Athletics Camp won the under-20 6km girls’ race in 21:25.6 ahead of Dorcas Chepkemoi (21:49.0) and Regina Wambui (22:26.9). Next weekend’s national trials will culminate in the naming of Team Kenya to the Africa Cross Country Championships in Lome, Togo in May.
