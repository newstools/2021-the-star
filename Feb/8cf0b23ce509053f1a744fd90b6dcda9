Some MPs want to criminalise the debate over 'hustlers versus dynasties'. A Bill is likely to come to the National Assembly this month (see P2). Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange, National Security committee chairman, wants the National Cohesion and Integration Act amended to outlaw incitement along class lines. At present the law mostly relates to ethnicity, race, nation and religion. The concern of MPs is understandable at a time when political tensions are boiling over. Deputy President William Ruto has fashioned a very effective narrative pitting 'hustlers' against 'dynasties'. The country is now deeply polarised over BBI and its political future. Yet, it should be recognised that Kenya is one of the most income unequal countries in Africa. The rich are extremely rich and the poor are extremely poor, with "10 millionaires and 10 million beggars" as JM Kariuki predicted. The 'hustlers vs dynasties' narrative exploits that social tension but it should not be banned. This is not a debate that should be pushed under the carpet. There needs to be more policy discussion of how the wananchi can get a better deal in society, perhaps through greater investment in health, education and agriculture.
