Kenya will start countrywide livestock vaccination in all 47 counties in two weeks. An increase in livestock diseases in several counties has undermined the country's international livestock markets. “Currently our livestock exports to Kuwait have been banned due to disease outbreaks but we believe harmonised (simultaneous) vaccinations will help resolve this," Agriculture and Livestock CAS Lawrence Angolo Omuhaka said on Wednesday. PS for Livestock Harry Kimtai said vaccination by the national and county governments will begin in two weeks' time. It is impossible for individual counties to control livestock diseases that spread beyond borders, Kimtai said. Vaccination will cover foot and mouth disease, Rift Valley fever and PPR. Speaking in Naivasha after meeting all the 47 Agriculture CECs, the PS said funding was the major problem. Many counties have not set aside funds for livestock vaccination, leading to an increase in disease, he said. “The national government will soon stop funding vaccinations as these fall under the county government and it's time that they set budgets for this,” he said. CAS Omuhaka said the livestock sector that employs millions of people faces tens of problems, disease being the most serious. Chairman of the CECs' agriculture committee Albert Mwaniki welcomed the coordinated exercise, calling transboundary transmission a threat to all counties. He said counties were ready to set aside funds. “We have experienced professionals and vets who are ready to implement this joint vaccination as it’s our responsibility as counties," Mwaniki said.
