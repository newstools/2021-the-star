Kenya Breweries Limited, has unveiled a Diageo Bartenders Academy whose aim is to upscale, build capacity and trade engagement to Kenyan bartenders. The Academy intends to train 10,000 bartenders in the country over the next four months. “This programme will sharpen the skills of bartenders in Kenya, and as well raise the profile of the art form of bar service,” said KBL Commercial Director, Joel Kamau. The launch coincided with World Bartenders Day, which was marked in Nairobi, Mombasa, Thika, Kisumu and Nakuru. “We want to build a very strong bartenders’ movement in Kenya. Our consumers taste, and needs are evolving every day, therefore it is important we champion this course.” Kamau said. The academy will bring practical knowledge to Kenyan bartenders, who want to better themselves in their careers, inspiring them to take their jobs as bartenders as valid career options. With many bartenders stuck at home during government closures due to the pandemic, the Academy serves as a great platform to keep bar brains sharp as well as entertained during this period of downtime. In the first module, bartenders are required to attend a one day training workshop where they learn about customer service, the art of bartending, tools of the trade, bartender secrets, drink categories, spirit production, brand knowledge, perfect serves, counterfeit spotting, up selling and, importantly, responsible serving.
