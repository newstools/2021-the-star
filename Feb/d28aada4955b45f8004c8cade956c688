The Kenya Bureau of Standards has seized Riri maize flour which was in the market despite not having certification marks. The flour was seized on Wednesday in Makuyu, Gatundu, and Ruiru. The agency said that the flour did not have certification marks, and has called upon Kenyans to be vigilant. Members of the public have also been asked to report any substandard products through Kebsâ€™ toll-free number 1545. Kebs said that its certification marks have a number below the mark, which can be verified by sending the number to 20023. Manufacturers are now required to display the Standardisation Mark Permit Number below the mark. On Wednesday, Kebs issued new food safety and hygiene guidelines for all workers in the food production and supply chains as the fight against Covid-19 continues. The new standard KNWA 2931:2021 provides guidelines on the use of personal protective equipment (PPEs), management of staff sickness at premises and physical distancing. Others are the identification of high touchpoints, and good personnel hygienic practices such as hand washing, use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers and disinfection of work surface critical to food business operations. The guidelines are intended to supplement existing codes of hygiene practice that have been published and complement the Food Management Systems that business operators have put in place, and does not replace the existing codes of hygiene practice.
