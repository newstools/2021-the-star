Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru urged residents of her county to support the BBI initiative and separate it from 2022 politics. The governor said the residents are fully aware of the benefits in BBI such as the 35 per cent allocation to counties, five or cent to the ward fund the 30 per cent gender representation. "On the matters BBI we have explained to our people, it is for our own benefit. We need to first keep this in our pocket then in 2022 in August, we will come and discuss politics," Waiguru said on Thursday. "Those who want to go left will go and those who want to go right will go. But in Kikuyu we have said that we will fly with that which we have swallowed." Kirinyaga is among 43 counties which have up to April 26 to approve or reject the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. So far, four counties have already voted with ODM leader Raila Odinga's bastions of Homa Bay, Kisumu and Siaya approving the BBI Bill. Baringo County Assembly on Thursday became the first to reject the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill after a chaotic session. 24 out of 47 counties are required to pass the Bill. Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui last week announced that all county assemblies in the Mt Kenya political bloc will pass the BBI referendum Bill on February 23. Last month, Waiguru said the people of Kirinyaga should read the report and decide whether or not to support the initiative. " I have read it and I know what it says...but...let our people read and then we know the direction we take and on what side, " Waiguru said. Ward representatives from 10 counties last month assured President Uhuru Kenyatta that they will pass the Building Bridges Initiative legislation within the required legal timeline. The assurance by Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Embu, Kirinyaga, Nyeri, Murang'a, Nyandarua, Kiambu, Laikipia and Nakuru MCAs was made on Friday at Sagana State Lodge in Nyeri County.
