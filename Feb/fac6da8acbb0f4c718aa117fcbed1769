Protected constituencies — that do not meet the population quota set by IEBC — will be secured by the Building Bridges Initiative, Mau Mau leaders have said. They have asked opponents of the BBI to explain what they stand to gain if it is rejected by Kenyans and the constituencies scrapped. Wambugu Githaiga, secretary-general of the Mau Mau Governing Council of Kenya, said the constituents of the special constituencies should be first to support the document. In Nyeri county, Othaya, Tetu and Mukurwe-ini are protected constituencies. The total number is 27 across the country. Githaiga warned that people from the three constituencies in Nyeri will revert to travelling long distances to seek services of their MPs if they are scrapped. The residents also risk losing the Sh100 million CDF kitty each year, he said. Githaiga called on politicians to stop bringing politics of 2022 into the BBI debate. It has nothing to do with ODM leader Raila Odinga or Deputy President William Ruto’s succeeding the president, he told the Star in Nyeri on Thhursday. “Let us first pass the BBI then discuss 2022 succession politics when that time comes,” he said. “The president is through the BBI trying to ensure we get what we have never gotten since Independence, which is bringing equal representation and more resources at the grassroots.” He said the Mau Mau will not sit and watch as people insult the president. They will be responding to such people going forward. The president must be respected, he said. He asked residents to heed to President Uhuru Kenyatta’s advice and pass the BBI, saying the head of state means well for Mt Kenya region people. Githaiga was accompanied by youth coordinator Tabitha Mbugua  and Michael Karanja, the aspiring chairman for Mau Mau Nyeri Welfare Association.
