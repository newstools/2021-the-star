Gor Mahia and AFC Leopard faced each other on Sunday at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani under the Covid-19 restrictions. On normal days, the noise from fans from both teams dominates the stadium, donning on their favourite teams’ jazzes. The Sunday match saw both teams fighting to show dominance when it comes to the derby. AFC Leopard (Ingwe) was longing to beat Gor and end their dominance but they have to wait and prove themselves in the next match as they failed to maneuver Gor’s solid defense. The last time Ingwe beat Gor was in 2016, when the game ended one-nil. On Sunday, Sports CS Amina Mohamed was in the stadium to witness the biggest game in the Kenyan Premier League. She said that her ministry continues to support the full resumption of sporting activities in strict adherence to the Resumption to Sporting Activities Protocols developed together with the Ministry of Health. Before the match, fans from both teams thronged the streets of Nairobi decorated with their jazzes.
