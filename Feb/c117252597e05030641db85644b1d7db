A businessman in Luanda town incurred a Sh8 million loss after his shop went up in flames on Thursday night. The cause of fire is yet to be established. David Ongaro, the shop owner, said he received a call from his friend, informing him his shop was razed. "I had already closed my shop by then, so I was just phoned by a friend my shop was on fire at around 8pm," Ongaro said. "So I had to came back at around 8:30pm and what I saw here I wasn't able even to explain because fire was all over," he added. Ongaro says nothing was saved from his shop despite the good will of the people around. The business community has urged the county government to establish a fire station within Luanda to help them curb fire incidences in Luanda. "We want to have a fire station here at Luanda that will help us to curb this fire cases that have made our partners lose their stocks," John Mukuns, a Luanda business patron, said.
