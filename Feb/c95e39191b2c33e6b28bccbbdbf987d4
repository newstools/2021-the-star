Kabras Sugar Racing Team is leaving nothing to chance with just a four weeks to the second round of the KCB Kenya National Rally Championship in Machakos. Baldev Chager led his Kabras Sugar Racing stablemates Tejveer and Onkar Rai to an unprecedented clean sweep during the first round held at the Soysambu Conservancy in Nakuru County last weekend. Chager understands pretty well that time in the rally is of essence and will be seeking to lower it in next month’s second round. “Our team is very vigilant with preparation of the cars. We have to make sure they are in good condition and shape. It is very important,” said Chager. The 'Flying Singh' admitted that the contest for the coveted title was still far from over as it’s still early days. He underscored the need to defend his title with the much needed flamboyance and speed. Chager intends to resume testing in the next one week with focus on increasing the speed. Round 2 of the KNRC  will be held in Machakos County on the weekend of March 27-28. Although Tejveer and Onkar Rai had to contend with playing second fiddle to the winner, Chager reckons that they will be no pushovers in the season. “Onkar and Tejveer are my teammates but I will try as much as I can to ensure they remain behind me in our subsequent racing,” said Chager. Tej, on the other hand, attributed his sterling performance to hard work and practice. He exuded confidence that Kabras Sugar Racing will post exemplary times in the season . “It is my hobby and passion to rally and more so savour  the presence of Kabras Sugar brand in motors port. Our team is focused and looking forward to the second round. I’ve no doubt that with early preparations we shall again produce good results,” said Tej.
