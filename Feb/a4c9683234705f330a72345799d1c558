You will receive a text message notifying you to collect your Huduma Namba card. The government has started distribution in Nairobi. In a notice, the Ministry of Interior urged Kenyans to collect their cards once they receive a text message. “You can collect your Huduma Namba card after receiving an SMS from any of the 11 subcounty registration offices, five Huduma Centre stations or Nyayo House issuance centre,” the notice read. Collection can be done during government working hours from Monday to Friday and between 8am and 4pm at the weekends. President Uhuru Kenyatta and First Lady Margaret Kenyatta were the first to receive their cards during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Kisii last year. The card was introduced in 2019 with the aim of replacing the national identity card, which the government intends to phase out by December this year. Registration for the Huduma Namba, also referred to as the National Integrated Identify Management System (Niims), was guided by a regulation gazetted in October 2020. Under the Registration of Persons (National Integrated Identity Management System) Rules, 2020, the government sought to register Kenyans from six years. Those aged 18 years and above are required to have the Huduma card, while those from six to 17 years will be issued with a minor’s Huduma Namba card. The state spent Sh9.6 billion in the process that has since seen at least 38 million Kenyans register.
