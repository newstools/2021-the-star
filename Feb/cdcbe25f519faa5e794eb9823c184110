Zari Hassan's secondborn Raphael Jnr Ssemwanga has released his debut song,  'Iss 2 Much', in which he has been featured by South African group A8trvp. Raphael now uses his stage name The Kid RJ in the Amapiano song, which was released a week ago. He is the only son of Zari's who has shown an interest in the entertainment industry. He follows Zari's footsteps as she was an artiste before she quit the career to concentrate on her businesses. This song comes in the wake of Junior announcing he was gay before Zari denied it. "I’m just letting you guys know here first that like hold the brakes,” he said on Instagram. "I don’t know why my whole 13 years on this earth, I was taught that females are the only way for gents, and you know for me personally, I don’t see it that way. Personally I like boys. Men, you know what I’m saying, and that’s how it is." Adding, “I’m serious. I’m gay, hundred per cent gay and not bi or anything. And I don’t know why you guys  are laughing at this, it's not funny.” However, Zari said he was kidding. "Raphael is not gay, he is dating. He started dating when he was 14 years. He’d ask for money to go to the mall with his girlfriend," she said. She however said if he ever turned out to be gay, she would give him the support he needs. "It's my duty as a parent but for now, we just clear the air to say Raphael is not gay." After his video went viral, Raphael came out to say he was just seeking attention. "I am not gay. It's not that I care what people say, but it is making me feel famous, man."
