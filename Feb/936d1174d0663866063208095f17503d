MPs troop back to Parliament tomorrow after more than two months on recess. They return to debate important Bills that will, if approved, impact on public life for generations.  There are eight Bills sponsored by the majority party, 15 committee Bills and 50 Bills sponsored by individual members. Among these are two conflicting referendum Bills, sponsored by different committees of Parliament. Processing these laws, considering the deep-seated political differences, could be emotive. However, we call upon MPs to apply considerable wisdom and introspection when debating. The gravity of the decisions they will make presupposes that they will reflect, deeply, about the intentions of the law and its impact or suitability. The public has placed a huge amount of responsibility on the legislators and they must demonstrate that they put their country and constituents first and not political or financial factors. The desire for serious soul-searching is even more urgent because the 2022 general election is looming. It is a time that is fraught with political anxiety, both for the MPs and their party bosses. The more parochial MPs might take the Bills lined up for debate as a chance to settle scores and engage in futile one-upmanship.
