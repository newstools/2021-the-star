Mzee Abdul Juma's biological daughter says the family fears the father is sinking into depression. This is after Diamond's mother Sandrah came out to reveal he is not the biological father of the bongo star. In an interview with Tanzanian media, she said, "What hurt me most is why does one deny their father? Right now my dad is not doing well," she said. She added that nowadays, Mzee Abdul spends time alone, thinking. "I did not expect Diamond to speak the way he did. I am not forcing to be his sister and yet he decides to say that Abdul is not his real dad." Mzee Abdul’s daughter added that Diamond and his mother are playing mind games with the public. She hopes her father will be okay soon and forget about what happened. In a recent interview with Wasafi FM, Diamond said he came to learn that Mzee Abdul was not his biological father in 2000 courtesy of Rommy Jons’ mother. "Ni kweli mzee Abdul sio baba yangu mzazi. Lakini tangu mtoto nilikuwa nampenda sana, mpaka mwaka 2000 ndio mama yake Romy Jons akaniambia ukweli. Hakuna mtu ambaye alikuwa anajua ukweli kwa sababu ndugu zangu wote niliwakusanya kwa upendo kuanzia wakina Ricardo (Momo) na Queen Darling," he said. The Wasafi CEO went on to explain that despite the revelation, he had continued to respect Mzee Abdul as his father, despite walking out on them when he was still a baby.
