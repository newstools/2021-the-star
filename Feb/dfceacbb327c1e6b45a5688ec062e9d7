The International Criminal Court has today officially released lawyer Paul Gicheru from its custody. This means that the pre-trial chamber’s decision was implemented as soon as the ICC Registry finalised all the necessary arrangements. In a statement on Monday, ICC said Gicheru was released to Kenya with specific conditions restricting liberty, during the confirmation of charges proceedings against him at the court. This follows Pre-Trial Chamber A's decision on January 29, 2021, granting him interim release with conditions. He is suspected of offences against the administration of justice consisting in corruptly influencing witnesses of the Court. The confirmation of charges procedure, in this case, will, in principle, be conducted in writing to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to conduct the subsequent phase of the proceedings. Gicheru is among the three Kenyans whom the international court had been looking for interfering with its witnesses in the cases against humanity related to the 2007-08 post-election violence. The Chamber additionally noted that the Prosecutor did not oppose Gicheru’s request for interim release together with conditions restricting liberty and that he is suspected of offences under article 70(1)(c) of the Rome Statute, consisting in corruptly influencing witnesses regarding cases from the situation in Kenya, which attract lower sanctions if established. Moreover, the Chamber is of the view that the risks mentioned under article 58(1)(b) of the Rome Statute may be adequately mitigated by imposing conditions restricting liberty. In the event that Gicheru would fail to comply with any of the conditions, the Chamber may declare the financial security provided by Gicheru forfeit to the Court. It may also issue a warrant of arrest in respect of Gicheru at the request of the Prosecutor or on its own initiative, and/or issue any other order it deems relevant in relation to a failure to comply with these conditions.
