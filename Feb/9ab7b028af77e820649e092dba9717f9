Kenya Airways and Avianor are making aerospace history with a first-ever cabin cargo repurposing of a Boeing 787 into a “Preighter”. The term preighter was coined in the pandemic to refer to passenger aircraft converted to carry cargo. This joint effort is a worldwide breakthrough as it is the first-ever cargo repurpose of this type to be performed on the Boeing 787 model, demonstrating Kenya Airways and Avianor’s role as trailblazers in the aero industry. It addresses the growing demand for increased cargo capacity and the demand for essential and medical goods while supporting future commercial opportunities thereby contributing to the stimulation of the local and regional economies. Work on the repurposed cabin began in late 2020. It has been certified to carry up to 16 tonnes of cargo, potentially enabling the aircraft to reach its maximum payload while in cargo operation of 46 tonnes. This move by Kenya Airways will address the growing demand for increased cargo capacity while supporting future commercial opportunities thereby contributing to the stimulation of the local and regional economies. While speaking at the launch event this morning, Kenya Airports Authority MD, Alex Gitari noted that the Authority will continue to support the air cargo industry by providing the requisite infrastructure and facilities within our network of airports. JKIA has a capacity of 1.2 million, including 9,000m² of cold room facilities; undoubtedly, the leading cargo hub in Africa. Kenya Airways launch of the KQ Cargo Preighter is timely as it enhances JKIA’s cargo capacity and ability to handle transshipments of Covid-19 vaccines.
