BBC journalist Larry Madowo says he used to spend Sh4,100 on a hair cut every week. Showing off his bald shaved head, Larry said he learned to shave on his own after Covid-19 hit, thanking the late Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore for advising him to be doing so. "See that bald, shiny head? My barber went on vacation for 2 months (in this economy!?) so I learned to cut my hair. And saved $40 every week," he posted. "Iâ€™ve finally learned to shave almost 10 years after @bobcollymore (RIP) encouraged me to do it like he used to. He said I was wasting money. He would be proud." Larry said most men cut their hair by themselves. A fan, Gzaxs, responded, "I joined the bandwagon when corona struck about a year ago."
