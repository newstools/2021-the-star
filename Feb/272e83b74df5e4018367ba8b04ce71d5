Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini said the referee ruined the match by sending off Remo Freuler early on in his side’s 1-0 Champions League last-16, first-leg defeat to Real Madrid on Wednesday. Freuler was sent off in the 17th minute for denying Real’s Ferland Mendy a goalscoring opportunity — the earliest red card in the Champions League for over three years — and it was an uphill battle from there for Gasperini’s side. The 10 men held on until four minutes from fulltime when Mendy curled a fine winner. The match, according to Gasperini, ended as a contest with Freuler’s dismissal. “I don’t know what the result would’ve been,” Gasperini told Sky Sport Italia. “But the game was completely ruined by an incident that was judged excessively. I just got banned for saying something in Serie A, if I say something now then UEFA will ban me for a month. But this is football suicide. We cannot have referees who’ve never played the game and don’t know the difference between a challenge and a foul. “If they can’t tell the difference, then they ought to go and get a different job, frankly. They should get people who played football to referee instead.” An injury-hit Real struggled to create anything against the resolute hosts for much of the match until Mendy’s strike, and Gasperini took heart from a spirited showing, with the tie far from over ahead of the return leg in Madrid on March 16. “We defended well and almost brought home the 0-0, but it would’ve certainly been more entertaining with 11 against 11,” he added. “We might’ve lost anyway, I am not complaining about the result, but we at least could’ve played our game. We’re satisfied, though, and we are going to Madrid to play our game.”
