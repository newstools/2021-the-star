Leading gaming company Mozzart on Wednesday 3 February commissioned a water point worth Ksh 2.1 Million at St Basil Lurambi Primary School in Kakamega. This is part of their "100 WELLS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES" initiative that was launched last year with the people of Imbo in Homa Bay being the first beneficiaries of a water well that provides access to clean water to the community. Mrs. Mabel Afandi, St Basil Lurambi Primary School’s deputy head teacher, thanked Mozzart for the kind gesture. “We have lacked water for the last four years and now that Mozzart has commissioned this water project right inside the school, the students will now have more time to focus on their studies. Previously we used to order them to ensure they come with water from home every day. This project will also benefit their parents and the entire community,” she said. “The people of Lurambi had to walk long distances to the river and most have suffered from water borne diseases. These will now be a thing of the past as we now have clean water right here in our school courtesy of Mozzart.” - Mrs. Mabel Afandi, Deputy Head Teacher, St Basil Lurambi Primary School. Sasa Krneta, Mozzart’s Country Manager reiterated the company’s commitment to supporting Kenyan communities. “As Mozzart, we are very committed to helping communities in Kenya by supporting important sectors of their daily lives like access to clean drinking water and health. We have done this across different counties in Kenya and we are happy today to officially open this water point, the second one we have done so far,” he said, “Our aim is to get to at least establish 100 new water points across different areas in Kenya. On behalf of Mozzart, I want to assure you that this is just the beginning, we hope to do more and our doors are always open to listen and support Kenyans.” He concluded. The Mozzart team will on Thursday 4 February head to the Kakamega Referral Hospital to donate medical equipment.
