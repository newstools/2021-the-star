Two people died on Thursday in separate road accidents in Machakos county. They died after the vehicles they were travelling in veered off the road and plunged into rivers Athi and Mwania in Mavoko and Machakos subcounties. In the first incident, a truck ferrying sand from Mombasa general direction to Nairobi plunged into River Athi at Stage 39 bridge at 6.30pm. The turn-boy died on the spot. The driver was critically injured. Athi River subcounty police commander George Kashimiri said the accident occurred due to speeding. The body of the turn-boy was taken to Shalom Community Hospital mortuary in Athi River, while the driver was taken to the same hospital. “The truck veered off the road, hit a rail guard and plunged into River Athi at Stage 39 Bridge,” Kashimiri said in his Athi River office on Friday. He warned motorists against violating traffic rules. In the second accident, Machakos Level 5 Hospital procurement officer Eric Nzomo died after he lost control of his vehicle on Thursday midnight. Nzomo, according to police sources, died after his vehicle plunged into River Mwania. “Yes it’s true, Eric Muithya Nzomo died on the spot at midnight. He was alone in the car when the incident happened,” a senior police officer texted. According to multiple sources, Nzomo left Machakos town driving to Katumani through Katoloni but his car veered off the road, hit the bridge guard rail and plunged into the river. Police removed the body to Machakos Level 5 Hospital mortuary. The vehicle was towed to Machakos police station.
