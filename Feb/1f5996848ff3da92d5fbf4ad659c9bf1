Residents of Mwangulu in Lunga Linga constituency have said a police station opened in the area will help address insecurity in Mwereni and Dzombo wards. Led by Mzungu Ruwa, they said the two areas have been known for killings of elderly persons and cattle theft. “The station is a solution to our problems because burglary activities are alarming in this place and white-haired people are killed recklessly over witchcraft allegations,” he said. Ruwa said he expects more police officers to be deployed in the area to boost security patrols. He said the existence of the police station instils confidence that the government is in control and community safety is assured. “At least the building has raised the security status; just by looking at it, you already feel the law around you,” he said. Area MP Khatib Mwashetani pumped Sh8.4 million from the Constituency Development Fund for the police station. The old station was congested and unfit for purpose. Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday opened the facility and a chief's office in the same area. The residents said it will also reduce disputes arising from land issues. Nguso Mwabegi said culprits have begun to feel fearful, knowing their days are over. Mwabegi said he is positive that crime will will no longer be the community’s biggest problem. He said emergency related issues would swiftly be responded and perpetrators brought to justice. Residents hope that the new police post would boost the fight against illegal immigration and drug trafficking from Tanzania into Lunga-Lunga. Mohamed Mwakuyala advised the police to serve with diligence and honesty. “Let the new post be a place where services will be given freely and equally to everyone,” he said.
