A woman has been charged with robbing an M-pesa attendant Sh80,000 at gun point alongside others who were not before the court. Rosebellah Atieno is accused of robbing Ruth Mbithe while armed with a pistol in Kangemi, Nairobi on February 22. Police said Atieno went to the shop and ordered Mbithe to surrender all the amount she had in a carrier bag. Mbithe then followed the order before a man entered the shop prompting the accused person to run away. Atieno was charged on Wednesday before Kibera senior principal magistrate Esther Boke where she denied the charges. She was released on Sh500,000 bond with the same surety. The case will be mentioned on March 10.
