Shujaa will be aiming to go one step better during the second leg of the Madrid Sevens this weekend. Innocent Simiyu's charges finished second in the opening last weekend, losing to Argentina 21-14 in the final and 21-7 in the pool stage. However, Shujaa made light work of Spain 19-5, USA 36-5 and Portugal 36-5. Simiyu said he was looking for improvement from the side especially on discipline and defence. "In the final against Argentina, we had Nelson Oyoo sent to the sin bin and that worked to Argentina’s advantage. At the same time, we had a couple of defensive lapses but, all in all, it's a good performance considering the boys had not played competitively for over a year," noted Simiyu. Kenya face Portugal, USA, Spain tomorrow and conclude their preliminaries on Sunday with fixtures against Chile and Argentina . Meanwhile, the Lionesses will be seeking to bounce back after losing all their six matches last weekend. It was a torrid outing for the ladies, who lost 41-0 to Russia, 63-5 to France, 29-7 to USA and 12-10 and 10-7 to hosts Spain. Felix Oloo said they have reviewed their poor performance and will be hoping for a change of fortunes for the second tournament. “We made basic errors in our opening matches. I thought the girls improved as the tournament went on so with a few matches under our belt, the girls will be sharper and competitive come the weekend,” said Oloo. The Lionesses face Russia, Poland, USA, France and Spain tomorrow with the top two teams heading to the final on Sunday.
