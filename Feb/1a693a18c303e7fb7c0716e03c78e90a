Kenya is among countries set to receive Covid-19 vaccines before end of February, COVAX has said. In a report released on Wednesday, Kenya is listed among the countries that will get the recommended vaccines as per the WHO Emergency Use Listing Procedure . Kenya will receive 4,176,000 doses as Uganda receives 3,552,000 doses of the vaccines in the region, while Rwanda will receive 996,000 doses. Somalia will receive 1,224,000 while Sudan is set to receive 3,396,000 doses compared to 864,000 to be distributed to South Sudan. Ethiopia is the country that is set to receive the highest number of doses in the region, which 8,928,000. Tanzania is the only country in the region that has not ordered the vaccine and is not on the list of the countries recognised by the COVAX facility. COVAX said it currently anticipates 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be available to the COVAX Facility in Q1 2021, subject to the completion of additional agreements. It will also be complemented by the larger volumes of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine available to the facility during the same time period. Additional volumes of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be available in the second quarter and beyond, per the signed advance purchase agreement between Gavi and Pfizer-BioNTech for up to 40 million doses. An exceptional process of distribution was undertaken to ensure maximum public health benefit from the smaller volume of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine anticipated to be available for Q1 delivery. All future allocation rounds will follow the standard facility approach. Total doses cover, on average, 3.3 per cent of the total population of the 145 participants receiving doses from at least one manufacturer.
