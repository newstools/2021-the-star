Deputy President William Ruto has said he’s not scared at whatever direction the Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020 will take as he is focussed on the presidency. The DP said he will not be moved because some people want to push him to lead a NO campaign against the BBI, but would not. “I don’t want to focus on BBI because it’s upon Kenyans to decide their own fate and the way they want to be governed but not the governors deciding how to share positions among themselves,” he said on Friday. He spoke in Nandi Hills town after a series of meetings in which he commissioned development projects in Nandi county. DP Ruto said it was now his turn to gun for the top seat after supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta from 2002. He said the “hustlers” had opted to use the wheelbarrow sign as their logo and had nothing to do with classification of the society. “Why are they concerned with our wheelbarrow trying to interpret its meaning yet they are not telling us what the “Orange, umbrella, cockerel, lion, buffalo or vuvuzella meant…ours is hard work and eating by your sweat,” Ruto said. He said the hustlers nation doesn't believe on them being “organised” from the top by the mighty and powerful but by themselves. “Even the economy, we will not use the current style of borrowing but ensure generation of revenues to fund development because where we are now as a nation is bad due to external debts,” he said. Ruto who was accompanied by Muranga senators Irungu Kang’ata (Murang'a),  Samson Cherargei(Nandi) Governor Stephen Sang, who was teh host, and MPs Alex Kosgey (Emgwen), Vincent Tuwei (Mosop), Julius Meli (Tinderet). Others were Cornelly Serem (Aldai), Uasin Gishu Woman Representative Gladys Shollei and her Nandi counterpart Tecla Tum. He commissioned an administration block at Chebisas Girls' High School, Kamarich Tea Factory and trauma centre and Nandi Hills and Kapsabet hospitals.
