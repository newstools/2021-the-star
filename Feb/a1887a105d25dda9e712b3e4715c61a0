World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge will compete in the Hamburg Marathon on April 11 as he seeks to put behind him a disappointing eighth-place finish at last year's London Marathon. The German city holds a special place in Kipchoge's heart since it was where he set a course record of 2:05:30 in his marathon debut. "I am going back to the genesis of my marathon career. For me, Hamburg is where it all began. I hope to inspire many people around the world by running a great race in the streets of this wonderful city," Kipchoge said. Dubbed 'the fastest route to Tokyo,' it will be an elite race, which offers athletes the chance to secure qualification to the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics by running a fast race and attaining the required qualification mark. The qualifying marks for the global showpiece are  2:11:30 and 2:29:30 for men and women respectively. Approximately 100 elite athletes will be expected to compete within a 10.5km loop in the centre of the city. "We want to show that we do everything we can to offer athletes a chance for a marathon. In this case it is extra special because it is a qualification for the Olympic Games," Jos Hermens, managing director of co-organisers Global Sports Communications, said. Other organisers of the event include NN Running Team and MHV Running Events. Deadline for the qualifying period is May 31.
