Football Kenya Federation Premier league side Posta Rangers have sacked their head coach Sammy 'Omollo' Pamzo. Kenya U-20 Rising Stars head coach Stanley Okumbi is set to take over at the Mailmen who have struggled to find their footing this season. They lie 13th in the top tier log on 10 points having only won once in their eleven league outings. Their latest debacle was a 1-0 loss to newbies Bidco United at Moi, Kasarani on Wednesday, an outcome that piled more misery on the side and could as well have been the last straw that broke the camel's back in Omollo,s case. The veteran tactician who was briefly bequeathed the privilege to guide champions Gor Mahia in their Caf Champions league assignments after Roberto Oliviera was ruled out of the dugout due to inferior qualifications, has failed to impress his bosses yet again after being accorded a second chance at the club. He suffered the same fate two years ago when he was sent packing alongside his assistant George Maina. Speaking to the Star on Thursday evening, Omollo, however, denied knowledge of the development, saying he had actually learned about his fate from the media. "Honestly, I'm getting this information from you. I'm not aware of such a thing," said Pamzo. Posta Rangers goalkeeper trainer Joseph Ruto also denied any knowledge of the news. "I haven't received any such information. Let's wait for official communication," said Kiplangat.
