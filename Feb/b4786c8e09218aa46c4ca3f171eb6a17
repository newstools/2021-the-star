Raw sewage has been flowing into Nairobi National Park turning the Hyena Dam into foaming green soup (see P10). The National Environment Management Authority intervened after an outcry on social media last week. It ordered the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company t0 fix any burst sewer lines and to investigate whether nearby housing and industry was discharging sewage into the park. It is amazing that the Kenya Wildlife Service has not been more pro-active in dealing with this crisis. When Friends of Nairobi National Park wrote to Nema, copied to the park manager, KWS said it could only comment after they had finalised an investigation. Surely it was an obvious emergency that raw sewage was polluting one of their crown jewels. Nairobi Water should also be ashamed of itself. Their staff should have been aware and intervened to stop sewage entering the park before it was brought to their attention by irate conservationists. Nairobi Park has suffered greatly from infrastructural development of the SGR viaduct and bypass excisions. It does not deserve to suffer from this further wilful neglect by KWS and Nairobi Water.
