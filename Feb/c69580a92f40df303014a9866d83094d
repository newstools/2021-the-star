Former national team bowler Alfred ‘Boi’ Njuguna has praised the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association for resolving to end the impasse, which has brought Kenyan cricket to its knees for over a decade. NPCA, consisting of Nairobi-based cricket clubs, plan to call a Special General Meeting and resolve the leadership wrangles bedevilling Cricket Kenya, the country's top governing body. "Kenya needs to settle this internal political crisis and we can only welcome NPCA’s action, which was critical for the future of Kenyan cricket," Njuguna said. During a meeting held three weeks ago at a Nairobi club, NPCA conducted their  elections, perceived as the first step in putting the cricket house in order. Kanbis’ Kanti Rabadia was elected as the new (NPCA) chairman replacing Tom Tikolo. Immediate NPCA fixtures secretary Narendra Patel is the new secretary with Vishal Bhojani replacing him as fixtures secretary. Former national cricket team manage,  Davinder Bharij was elected the new vice chairman. Njuguna — at one time appointed as national team coach in 2005 — lauded the move as the beginning of the end of the troubles in the sport. “It’s good that the clubs have finally realised the role they can play in our cricket. It’s a step in the right direction and we hope this is the beginning of an end to the leadership impasse we have had for months now,” he said. Changes in NPCA leadership—  Cricket Kenya's biggest affiliate — paves the way for elections at the national body and offers an opportunity to avoid a looming ban from the International Cricket Council. The troubles at CK have affected the association’s activities with staff and players going for months without salaries. On the field, the national team's fortunes have nosedived after reaching the semifinals of the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup held in Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa.
