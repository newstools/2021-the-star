A Limuru court has directed a woman accused of battering her 89-year-old husband to find an alternative home. Rose Wangui is charged with assaulting Harun Githinji at Ndeiya in Limuru on February 19, 2021. The order left her shocked. Resident magistrate Fred Koome explained that the order does not amount to divorce or separation but is a way of protecting Githinji from the alleged violence meted out to him by Wangui. "We have not separated you from your husband. We have asked you to look for an alternative place to stay once you get out with a bond or bail so that you may not interfere with the complaint," Koome said. The magistrate told probation officers to investigate the couple and bring their report to court to assist in reviewing the order. The report will guide the court to establish if the couple can stay together during her trial. Githinji's lawyer Njau Ngigi said the suspect had also battered her husband last October. She was then charged, but they agreed to settle the matter out of court. Ngigi said she has been mistreating her husband by locking him outside to spend the night in the cold. He requested tough bond terms. Koome granted her a Sh150,000 bond with a surety of the same amount and an alternative Sh100,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on March 8 and heard on March 20.
