Companies and individuals interested in taking part in the second Kenya Ports Authority East Africa Maritime Awards 2020 have until March 19 to submit their entries. KPA has extended the submission deadline from February 26. The awards seek to recognise and award notable users of the Port of Mombasa, both companies and individual players from the region, whose activities cut across the maritime sector. These include shipping, ports services, engineering, and leisure marine industries with operations in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Organsed in partnerships with the Kenya Maritime Authority (KMA), Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Kenya Trade Network Agency (KenTrade), Shippers Council of Eastern Africa (SCEA) and East African Business Council (EABC), and Think Business Limited, EAMA seeks to promote excellence in service delivery and adoption of best practices. The awards are meant to appreciate exceptional contribution to the industry and regional economies, encourage innovation and healthy competition among regional industry players and improve overall performance of the sector, KPA said in a statement on Wednesday. Winners will be unveiled at an award ceremony slated for May 21, 2021 in Mombasa.
