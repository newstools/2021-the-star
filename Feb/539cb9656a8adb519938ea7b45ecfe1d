The Kenya Bureau of Standards has approved 10 new standards outlining safe use, storage, transportation and disposal of Petroleum and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) products in the country. Kebs Managing Director Bernard Njiraini said the new standards aim to safeguard consumers throughout the LPG and other petroleum products supply chain. The new standards provide specifications for LPG mountable burners and cylinder grills used by the 3Kg and 6Kg LPG domestic cylinders and safe disposal of cylinders found not fit for use. Specifications on transportation modes, storage and distribution, codes of practice for LPG and requirements for road tankers used to transport flammable liquids have also been developed. For the last one year, a total of 44 incidents involving LPG and Petroleum tankers rollover and spillages and LPG cylinders were recorded. The standards are expected to address the problem of fire disasters due to accidents involving LPG and other petroleum products road tankers overturning on transit and cylinder explosions. Last year, various industries players in the petroleum and energy industry called upon the government to hasten the LPG regulatory reforms such as the enforcement of the LN100 , so as to have more Kenyans use LPG. The LN 100 governs the LPG industry and put an end to the mandatory interchange of one brand of gas cylinder for another as part of a vigorous move to end the illicit trade in LPG including the illegal refilling, rebranding, reselling, storage, and transporting of LPG.
