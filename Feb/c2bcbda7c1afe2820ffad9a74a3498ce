Instrumentalist David Wazzir, alias David Clary, has released a cover version of 'That's the way love goes' by Janet Jackson. Speaking to Word Is, Clary said the inspiration of the song was drawn from Valentine's season. "A season of sharing love and appreciating our significant others. I admire how love was in the 80s," he said. "There was an aspect of realism and respect was paramount between the husband and the wife, or between people who loved each other. So I decided to bring back that vibe this Valentine's." His interest in music developed while at Pumwani High School during music classes. This foundation inspired him to venture into the music career, and he took a music course before venturing to live performances.
