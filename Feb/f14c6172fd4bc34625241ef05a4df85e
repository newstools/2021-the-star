Busia deputy governor Moses Mulomi has asked striking nurses and clinical officers to rescind their decision and resume services to rescue suffering residents seeking services in public hospitals. Mulomi’s appeal comes in the wake of rejection by the  Kenya National Union of Nurses Busia chapter to sign a return to work formula that would have seen 580 nurses end 64 - day strike that commenced on December 7, 2020. A seven hours meeting held at the deputy governor’s office that was attended by Busia Bishops Forum under the chairmanship of George Odhiambo and union officials led by Branch Secretary, Edwin Bwire and James Omusugut did not bear fruits. Bishop Odhiambo said it is unfortunate that meeting has come to another stalemate which now gives them technical knockout when to start another arbitration. “I thank the union for listening to us and for your time‚” he said. The deputy governor said they had agreed on many issues with few remaining. Those fulfilled include; employing health workers on contract into permanent and pensionable basis and employment of over 500 health workers. “We shall in this season offer NHIF enhanced Insurance cover despite good deliberations from the Bishops and the union said they need more consultations,” he said. Mulomi said it is unfortunate that the union-backed out after being in the team that drafted the return to work formula. Chief Officer Isaac Omeri said the main aim of the long day meeting was to break the stalemate even after the county government softened and agreed on all requirements to allow the Nurses to go back unconditionally. Omeri said it unfortunate that the signing of the document that would allow the return of normalcy in health services did not happen as the officer in charge of clinical officers was in Nairobi for training without giving any direction. “ I urge nurses and clinical officers willing to resume duty to do so and they will not regret‚” he said.
