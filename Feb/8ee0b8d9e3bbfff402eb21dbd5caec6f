Carrefour Kenya yesterday opened it's 12th store in Nairobi at the Westgate Mall in Westlands. The new store will serve residents of Westlands, Parklands and the larger Thigiri area. “As we continue to grow and expand our presence in Nairobi, we remain committed to addressing our customers’ needs effectively,” said Franck Moreau, Country Manager of Carrefour Kenya at Majid Al Futtaim Retail. The Westgate store will also introduce several digital services such as shopping delivery, or “Valet trolley” which will give customers the chance to shop and have their goods ready for collection at the store. Meanwhile, the Click & Collect service will allow customers to shop online and then drop by the mall to have their shopping brought to the trunk of their car. The store will boost the growth of Nairobi County’s economy through direct and indirect employment of over 200 Nairobi residents. This aligns with the retailer's dedication to developing local talent and investing in local careers as much as the growth of its industry. The store will also create opportunity for local suppliers and manufacturers to directly supply good and services to the new store. The opening of this store follows the recent Carrefour openings in Kwale County at Diani Centre Point Plaza and at the Nextgen mall, along Mombasa road in Nairobi.
