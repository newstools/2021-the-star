Administrators in Athir River subcounty of Machakos on Friday raided a chang'aa den and confiscated over 1,000 litres illicit brew. The illicit brew was confiscated during a joint raid conducted by three assistant chiefs who were led by Athi River chief Cecilia Nzyioka. The assistant chiefs included Nickson Paramisa, David Kirayian and Martin Ngomo of Empakasi, Oloshaiki and Athi River sublocations respectively. “I got a tip-off from a member of the nyumba kumi who told me that there were people brewing chang’aa at County village within my location. I mobilised my chiefs and village elders, raided the place and confiscated over 1,000 litres of the illicit brew,” Nzyioka told the Star. The brew was stored in five drums of 200 litres each. They were found in two separate rooms of a shanty. The chiefs also discovered other distilling apparatus including pipes and jaggery used by the suspects to brew alcohol. No suspects were arrested. “We managed to break the two rooms after we found them locked and recovered the consignment alongside the brewing regalia and apparatus. We thank the member of nyumba kumi for volunteering information,” Nzyioka said. The chiefs poured the brew and destroyed the distillation apparatus. The administrator warned those selling illicit brew and alcohol to move out of the location and face arrest. “I am issuing a warning to those involved in the illicit trade of brewing chang’aa that I have given you seven days to stop the business or move out of my location. We will deal with you accordingly,” Nzyioka said. She said the environment in which the illicit brew was being brewed was filthy and posted health risks to consumers. The drums in which the liquor was stored were dirty with indications that dirty water was used to distill the brew. Nzyioka said the illicit brew was being supplied to stockists in Athi River, Mlolongo and Kitengela towns and their environs.  Edited by P.O
