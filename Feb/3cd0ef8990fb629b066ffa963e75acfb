A Labour court has suspended a Gazette notice that appointed new members to the Nairobi City County Alcoholic Drinks Control and Licensing committees. Justice Mathew Nderi issued the order following a case filed by Eric Kiogora and Stephen Mwangi. The two told the court that the then acting Governor Benson Mutura breached the contracts of board members who were in office at the time the notice was issued. The Gazette notice dated January 12 this year announced that Mutura appointed members of the Alcoholic drinks and licensing committees. In making the appointments, he sent home all the members who were appointed in 2017. Judge Nderi directed the Nairobi City County Government, Acting Governor, Nairobi County Chief Officer, Commerce and Industrialization, the Government Printer and the Attorney General to file their responses within 14 days. The case will be mentioned on March 22. In the appointments by Mutura, Stephen Kambi was appointed as the boardâ€™s chairperson. Other members that were appointed include the Director of County Public Health Services, Chief Officer in charge of Security Compliance and disaster management, National Authority for the Campaign against Drug Abuse (NACADA) Chief Executive Officer Victor Okioma, County Commissioner for Nairobi and Chief Officer for Commerce, Tourism and Cooperatives, who was named the Secretary to the board
