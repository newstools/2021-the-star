Vihiga Queens' maverick forward Tereza Engesha is ready to defend her top scorers' award but admits it will be a tall order to achieve last season's milestone. The 23-year-old scored 36 goals to win the inaugural Kenya Footballers Welfare Association (KEFWA) Women Player of the Year Award in the 2019 season. She has helped Alex Alumira's  side win the national title for three consecutive seasons. The strong left-footed player has registered eight goals out of 13  scored by Queens so far this season and leads the scoring chart in Zone 'A' alongside Wadadia's Ruth Chebungei. Engesha, however, said with the reduced number of games, it will be an uphill task to score over 30 goals. Despite that, she hopes to maximise on her qualities to help the team retain the title. "It would have been very easy to repeat the 36 goals heroics but the league is no longer unified and we have fewer matches to contend with. I want to score as much as I can and help Queens keep the title but it won't be smooth-sailing like last season," she observed. "I am a modern day goal poacher  who pops up in big moments. I need to score more from the 18-yard box and I will have to use my power and technique which I am blessed with. My right foot is equally strong but not as powerful as my regular left. I would also like to hit the back of the net with my head," said the former Swedish Division Two side Dalhem IF player. Engesha is a big game player as she has routinely performed well in a high- pressure environment.  With Chebungei going toe to toe with Engesha at the moment, she  said she loves the competition as it will push her to be a better player. "It's true there's pressure but I blossom under it. I have been in this situation before and I know how to manage it. Let's wait and see how the season will unfold," she noted. Engesha featured for Starlets in the Confederation for 2019 Cecafa women's tourney in Tanzania, scoring once as the Kenya Queens powered their way to the regional gong.
