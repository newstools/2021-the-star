A charity has signed up more than 2,000 community health volunteers to sensitise Homa Bay residents on sanitation and prevention of infectious diseases. Kibos International Health Foundation on Friday also donated face masks to more than 520 residents at Gaena dispensary in Ndhiwa constituency. Teachers, learners and residents from around Bwanda Primary and Sigama Secondary schools benefited. KIHF representative Elango Murungaian said the initiative is also aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19. They are targeting schools in the first phase. “The campaign is meant to promote behaviour change to combat diseases starting from the grassroots. We’re also helping residents tackle Covid-19,” Murungaian said. He said they are training the community health volunteers to safely provide care to Covid-19 patients. “When you prevent diseases from spreading, you save thousands of lives. Prevention is better than cure,” he said. The programmes will be extended to other counties. Clinical officer Bernard Otieno and community health volunteer Agnes Awino said the partnership will help in addressing negative health indicators in Homa Bay. “The partnership will help in supplementing what the government provides to the local health facilities,” Otieno said. Awino urged the organisation to consider putting up a facility to enable HIV patients to access anti-retroviral drugs. “Homa Bay is one of the counties with a high HIV prevalence hence more attention should be given to it,” Awino said. Upper Kayambo chief Tomas Okeyo said they are working closely with the NGO to improve sanitation in the location.
