Naivas Supermarket employees will now be able to discreetly access HIV self-testing kits through vending machines. This is after the Population Services Kenya in collaboration with the Nairobi Metropolitan Services and Naivas Supermarket launched the programme at the Naivas headquarters in Nairobi on Friday. The vending machines are expected to play a critical role in the distribution of the HIV self-testing kits with limited human interaction to ensure Covid-19 mitigation measures are observed while offering a chance to an unreached population to test and know their status. "This initiative seeks to encourage employees to know their HIV status conveniently and discreetly using HIV self-testing kits. This way they are able to make informed sexual and reproductive health choices," Population Services Kenya CEO Joyce Wanderi said. The retail store which has a regional footprint of 70 stores countywide and a workforce of at least 7,200 employees is keen on reinforcing the importance of self-awareness and healthy behaviour among its staff. "We are delighted to collaborate with NMS and PS Kenya as the first supermarket to embark on this initiative, the well-being of our staff is paramount to the success of our business as it directly affects their performance and productivity," Naivas managing David Kimani said. Kimani added: "Naivas is committed to ensuring all our employees have access to information that will enrich both their personal and professional development." PS Kenya has been working with the health ministry and NMS HIV unit towards achieving the country's targets as per the UNAids global strategy of 90-90-90.
