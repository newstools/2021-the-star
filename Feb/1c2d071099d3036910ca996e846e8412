A Magistrates court has ordered a transgender to be remanded at a separate cell at Central Police Station after she denied claims of obtaining credit by false pretences. Katie Antonina Wanjiku alias Stephen Kamotho confessed to the court that she is a transgender. She said she fears for her life if she is remanded at Industrial Area Remand or Langâ€™ata Women's prison. It is alleged that between December 16 last year and February 3 this year, at Marble Arch Hotel Limited, she obtained a credit of Sh488,510 from the said hotel under the pretence that she would pay Sh1 million to cater until March 31 this year, a fact she knew to be false. She denied the charge before Milimani Chief magistrate Martha Mutuku and was granted a Sh200,000 cash bail. She however told the court she cannot afford the Sh200,000 bail. Mutuku then ordered for a probation report to see how the matter will be reviewed in the event she is unable to post bail. The case will be mentioned on February 16. Edited by Sarah Kanyara
