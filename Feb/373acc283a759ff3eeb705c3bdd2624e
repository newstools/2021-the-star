Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati has resolved his differences with his South Mugirango colleague Silvanus Osoro after a physical exchange at a funeral earlier this month in the same county over BBI. On February 1, Arati and Osoro engaged in a fight during the burial service of Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi 's father. But on Friday, during the burial service of Bonchari MP Oroo Oyioka at Itierio High school, Arati said he took responsibility for the exchange early in the month. “Apart from the small disagreements witnessed during the last burial, you have seen today that Osoro is my younger brother in terms of age as well as in the National Assembly,” Arati said. The two leaders shook hands on the podium, in a ceremony which was attended by the ODM leader Raila Odinga and Interior CS Fred Matiang'i among others. Raila rubbished claims he is pushing for BBI to ascend to the presidency. He said that his handshake with President Uhuru Kenya was meant to address a myriad of challenges facing the country. He said it is Kenyans who will make a decision to elect a president of their choice. The MP died on February 15, at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Kisumu where he was undergoing treatment. President Uhuru Kenyatta led the nation in eulogising Oyioka. Uhuru described him as an accomplished educator and determined legislator. Oyioka, who was a retired teacher and education official was a second-term MP elected on a People's Democratic Party ticket.
