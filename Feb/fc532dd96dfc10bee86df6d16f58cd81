Machakos county will pay its 2,820 community health volunteers over two years' stipend arrears once the Treasury releases funds, Health executive Dr Ancient Kituku has said. Kituku said they have processed payment schedules and applied for funds from the National Treasury as per laid down procedures. The county’s 2,820 community health volunteers have gone without pay for over two years since the establishment of 282 units under which they serve. “CHVs are volunteers and are not paid a salary. However, they receive a monthly stipend of Sh2,500. In the 2020-21 financial year, Machakos county government allocated a budget of Sh84 million to cater for the CHVs 'stipend,” Kituku said. Kituku spoke to journalists shortly after meeting representatives of the CHVs at Kangundo Level 4 Hospital on Monday. The Health executive said they were awaiting approval from the office of the Controller of Budget for the funds to be released. “The county government of Machakos is committed to channelling the funds to the CHV’s account immediately the release is effected. We regret the delay and deeply sympathise with the CHVs’ plight,” Kituku said. He urged the CHVs and members of the public to ignore “any attempts by a few people to politicise this issue”. “As Kenyans know, health issues are very sensitive because they involve lives hence should not be politicised. Let’s heed the clarion call “Afya yetu, jukumu letu,” he said. Kituku said the county government established the 282 community health units, each serving 5,000 people, to strengthen healthcare systems in Machakos. Each unit is served by 10 community health volunteers. The official said the CHVs had undergone short courses on basic health interventions and had been equipped with health kits and uniforms to enable them to perform their duties. “They are very committed and have improved community health outcomes amongst the populace. They have been very key in the containment of Covid-19,” Kituku said. (edited by o. owino)
