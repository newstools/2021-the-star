Quins have set their sights on toppling Enterprise Cup champions Kabras in the Charity Cup match at Nyayo Stadium on Saturday. The Ngong-Road outfit replaced champions KCB for the curtain-raiser to the start of the  season and club chairman Michael Wanjala said the game will be used to test combinations and preparation for the start of the season a week later. "The game will be used to gauge where we stand. We have been training for the past month and now we need to put to practice to what we have learnt," noted Wanjala. He termed Kabras a worthy opponent and said his charges are relishing the challenge. "Kabras are one of the top teams in the country and  will no doubt test us accordingly. However, I expect our boys to be competitive,” he added. Wanjala said the target for the season is to finish in the playoff bracket after missing out on the playoffs in the 2018-2019 season. "We have recruited well and brought in a new head coach. The mood is upbeat ahead of the start of the season,” he added. Elsewhere, KCB RFC tactician Curtis Olago has been appointed Kenya Under 20 head coach. Olago guided KCB to four Kenya Cup titles in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019.  Olago, an alumni of Nairobi School, has played for several rugby clubs including Mean Machine, Kisumu, Impala, Nondescripts and KCB. In an interview, Olago said, "It is a huge honour to be called upon to handle a national side. I am humbled by the appointment and look forward to steering Chipu to even greater heights.” Olago is expected to name the training squad for the Africa Under-20 Championship next week.
