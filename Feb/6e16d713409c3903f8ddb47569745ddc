ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has been challenged to go all out to market his presidential bid. Budalang'i MP Raphael Wanjala told Mudavadi that power is not given and he has to fight for it instead of telling people to “support me”. “Face​ off your competitors squarely,” Wanjala said. "We have seen DP [William Ruto] Ruto moving around. We have seen Baba [Raila Odinga] moving around as well to seek Kenyans’ support," he added. He noted that the DP was at the weekend seen in Khwisero and Matungu subcounties wooing voters while Mudavadi was missing in action. "Mudavadi should move around and seek votes from Kenyans," Wanjala said at Sosa cottage in Hamisi subcounty where he met youth from Western region. He said they expect to see Mudavadi traversing the Coast, Eastern and Northeastern regions instead of “appealing for power handover”. That is day-dreaming, he said. The lawmaker said those calling for Raila and DP Ruto to back Mudavadi are seeking free nominations from the ANC party. Wanjala's sentiments came a day after Vihiga Senator George Khaniri urged Mudavadi to face off with his competitors for the top seat or else he will be forced to pave way. Khaniri called for local leaders to drum up support for Mudavadi to give him a formidable base and campaign power in other regions. On the same note, Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi has called on ANC to market Mudavadi as a brand on his own but not under the party. "Vihiga has many parties. We have ODM, PPK, Wiper, Ford Kenya and Jubilee, among others. So if we don't belong to ANC, then we won't have business with him because we have our candidate," Saisi said. Wanjala said said Western and Nyanza should form a formidable bloc that will help to push their agenda rather than campaigning on the ever elusive Luhya Unity platform.
