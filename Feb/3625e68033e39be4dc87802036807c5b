Tokyo 2020 President Yoshiro Mori said on Tuesday that Japan would hold the Summer Olympics regardless of the situation with the Covid-19 pandemic and was working closely with the International Olympic Committee to make them happen. “We will hold the Olympics, regardless of how the coronavirus (situation) looks,” Mori said, adding that the discussion should focus on how, not whether, the Olympics will happen. “We must consider new ways of hosting the Olympics” as a part of that, he said. Mori added that while working together had its difficulties, Tokyo 2020 organisers and the IOC had a strong relationship. Mori was speaking at the start of a meeting with Japan’s Sports Research Commission. The 2020 Games were postponed last year due to the global spread of the novel coronavirus. A recent spike in infections in Japan that triggered a state of emergency in some areas has fuelled speculation about whether the rescheduled Games can be held this summer. Meanwhile, Italy’s Olympic downhill champion Sofia Goggia will miss her home world championships in Cortina d’Ampezzo after suffering a knee injury in Germany at the weekend. The Italian ski federation (FISI) said after scans in Milan that the season was over for the 28-year-old, who has won the last four women’s World Cup downhills and would have been a favourite in Cortina. Goggia is also leading the World Cup downhill standings, 195 points clear of American Breezy Johnson. The world championships at the Italian Dolomite resort are scheduled to run from February 8-21. FISI said Goggia sustained a compound fracture of the right knee after a fall in Garmisch-Partenkirchen while skiing back down to the valley after a Super-G race was postponed due to fog. Goggia missed the 2014 Sochi Olympics as a result of a cruciate ligament tear and had to end last season early due to a compound fracture of her left arm.
