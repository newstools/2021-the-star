BY ROBERT OMOLLO @robertomollo3 Four families are counting loses after fire gutted down their property at Makongeni estate in Homa Bay town on Tuesday. Residents said the 6am fire broke out from one of the houses in the four-unit rental house before spreading. They tried to salvage their household property but were overwhelmed by the fire which burned everything to ashes. Florence Owuor, a resident said they suspect the fire was caused by an electric fault. “There was a blackout earlier but we suddenly heard an explosion in one of the rooms when electricity returned. The fire spread very first and caught all the rooms before firefighters arrived,” Owuor said. The fire was finally put out by firefighters from the Homa Bay county government. A few people sustained slight injuries on their hands as they were trying to salvage their property. Red Cross coordinator Samuel Omondi urged residents to accommodate the affected families as they seek alternative places. “We’re going to help the families where possible,” he said. Homa Bay police commander Sammy Koskey said they are liaising with Kenya Power to establish what actually caused the fire.  Edited by Sarah Kanyara
