Enterprise Cup champions Kabras have stepped up preparations for the Charity Cup clash in two weeks time at Nyayo stadium. The sugar millers will be keen to lay a marker ahead of the season on February 27. Kabras chairman Phillip Jalango said the squad under the tutelage of South African Mzingaye Nyathi will be relishing the challenge after being inactive for the past nine months due to the Covid 19-pandemic. "There is an air of excitement and expectation for the Charity Cup as well as the League. The boys are hard at work and with the calibre of signings we have made and the new management team, we hope to go flat out this time round,” noted Jalango. Jalango said with the season only 11 weeks, adapting to the season format and Covid-19 protocols will be tricky.  “I believe all the clubs are affected. We have been out for long and adjusting to the demands of the season will be key if we are to go all the way and win,” he added. He added that the Charity Cup clash will be a good indicator to gauge the team in as far as their fitness levels are concerned.  “The match itself gives us a good opportunity to test ourselves and see if our systems are working and how to improve,” he noted.
