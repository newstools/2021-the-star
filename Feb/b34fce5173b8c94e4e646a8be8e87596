Deputy President William Ruto's unbridled political ambition is a huge hindrance to President Uhuru Kenyatta's development agenda, Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has said. Ngilu said that instead of Ruto assisting his boss to implement their party manifesto, he has been politicking since they took office in 2013. She spoke in Nzalae, Mwingi West, where she launched demarcation of a 50-year-old ranch owned by farmers. "Instead of helping the President in undertaking development, his commitment has been to politic ever since they were elected into office way back in 2013. This kind of behaviour must stop,” Ngilu said. Ngilu also criticised Ruto’s hustler and wheelbarrow narratives, saying the poor, especially young people, will gain significantly through the implementation of the BBI report. “In this era, what Kenyan people need more is nothing like wheelbarrows. Kenyans are in dire need of real development, which can only be actualised through the BBI that the Deputy President has been opposing." She urged residents to support the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020, when it is put to a referendum. This way, they will get more money at the grassroots and spur development.
