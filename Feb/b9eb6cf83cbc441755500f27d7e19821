Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi has claimed Mukhisa Kituyi is Raila Odinga’s project to 'confuse' the Luhya community. He said they won’t allow anyone to confuse them because they will support their own candidate in the 2022 general election. The lawmaker was speaking in Mululu village in his Sabatia constituency where ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi was hosting Luhya elders. “We shall teach Kituyi a lesson he will never forget in his political life,” Agoi said. Kituyi has already dismissed claims he is anyone's 'project'. "I'm not in Hustler, nor in any other political affiliate as is being claimed out there," he said. Agoi's sentiments come after Kituyi and Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana met Raila Odinga. The MP said they will build a strong force behind Mudavadi to ensure he clinches the presidency in the 2022 polls. He said they have supported Raila for over 20 years, and it is time he returns the favour. “It’s time for him to support Mudavadi for that seat as well,” he said. Lugari MP Ayub Savula said the region will support Mudavadi for the top seat. Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi said, “Mudavadi is the best candidate we have for that top seat. He will cure the economic mess we have here in the region and at the national level.” The MPs said they would help Mudavadi sell his agenda in other regions. The lawmakers urged the elders to support Mudavadi for him to secure the top seat. “Palipo na wazee hapaharibiki jambo [where there are elders, nothing can go wrong]. We are sure that you are going to advise Musalia on how to move soberly and get the top seat." the elders urged Mudavadi to seek support from other regions without using abusive language.
