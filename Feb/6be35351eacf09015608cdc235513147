Global vehicle exporter BE Forward is shaping up to uplift Kenya’s manufacturing sector by upscaling the delivery of equipment and spare parts amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This comes after a recent report by the Kenya Bureau of Statistics which noted that production of assembled vehicles increased from 768 units in August to 798 units in September 2020. The report also noted that machinery and other capital equipment; Fuel and lubricants; and transport equipment accounted for 17.81, 12.57 and 11.51, per cent of the total value of imports, respectively. BE Forward Senior Manager South & East Africa Group John Mutahi commended the government on its efforts to grow the manufacturing sector, noting that an increase in the vehicle imports was a positive sign of economic recovery. “Kenya being a fast-growing economy, there is huge demand for machinery and equipment as well as spare parts,” said Mutahi. In 2019, Kenya imported approximately 130,000 Vehicles which dropped by about 50 per cent in 2020 due to the pandemic. Although there was a huge demand of vehicles, the supply fell short due to unavailability of vessels which were stuck at various ports around the world. “With import regulations adapting to the pandemic, we are optimistic that the demand to Kenya will grow, albeit slowly,” said Mutahi. BE Forward has 7 local agent office in Kenya and over 100 agents globally in the approximately 200 countries they operate in. Globally BE Forward employs above 2,000 Staff both directly and indirectly, their systems support about 50 youth who have secured employment with BE Forward Local in Kenya alone.
