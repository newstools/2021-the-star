UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi is set to return to Kenya on Sunday to embark on his 2022 Presidential bid. In a statement released on Friday, his campaign committee said he will be received by family, friends and supporters on arrival at JKIA at 9 am. "The convoy will depart from the airport via Airport North Road, Outering Road, Jogoo Road to Friends Church, Makadara, for a Thanksgiving service at 11 am," the statement read. He will thereafter hold a press conference at 2.30 pm at the Serena Hotel. Last week, Kituyi tendered his resignation at UNCTAD ahead of his stab at the presidency. Kituyi announced in January that he will be among the Kenyans seeking the top seat next year's General Election. Kituyi said he had decided to run for the presidency because the country was currently experiencing a "total vacuum in leadership" as plans for President Uhuru Kenyatta's succession take place. “Every challenge is an opportunity for us, the challenge here is we have a flock without leadership and this is an opportunity for us to lead,” he said. He became UNCTAD’s seventh secretary general on September 1, 2013, and his second term was to end in September this year. Kituyi served the country as the Minister of Trade and Industry from 2002 to 2007 and had also been elected as an MP twice.
