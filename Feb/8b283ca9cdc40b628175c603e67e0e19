The National Olympic Committee-Kenya disbursed approximately  Sh2.8 million to the men and women's rugby sevens teams, Shujaa and Lionesses to aid their preparations for the Tokyo Olympics. The financial boost is part of the Sh10 million sponsorship package from the Kenya Charity Sweepstake for Team Kenya as they gear up for the quadrennial event. "If you look at rugby and volleyball, it has been a struggle to get the players together and to get a venue that is Covid-19 compliant as per the guidelines of the ministry of sports and health. The Sh10m  immediately goes into the work of preparing our teams for Tokyo 2020," NOC-K's acting secretary general, Francis Mutuku said. Mutuku said the committee is working round the clock to solicit and avail more funds to sportspersons who are pursuing qualification or have sealed their tickets to Tokyo. "We have been saying we need to get our athletes training. The money availed has been the direct scholarship for individual athletes’ training. In terms of Team Kenya, we are still looking for money and therefore what this sponsorship does is help us get our teams to start training, especially the team sports," Mutuku said. Lionesses' skipper Philadelphia Olando was elated and described the arrival of the funds as timely as both teams prepare for a training camp and friendly matches in Spain. "We have always struggled in preparation for major games because of funding. It is important to have funds for training, equipment and allowances for players. This support from Kenya Charity Sweepstake is a timely boost. We are now motivated knowing that we can train and prepare well for the Olympics," Olando said. Kenya Rugby Union will today morning name the respective teams to board the plane to Spain for the tournament organised by the Spain Rugby Federation.
