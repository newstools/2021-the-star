The Nairobi government spent nothing on development between July and September last year. Out of the county's Sh31.4 billion 2020-21 budget, Sh6.4 billion was allocated to development. This information is in the Controller of Budget's County Governments Budget Implementation Review report for the first quarter for the financial year 2020-21. The report indicates that implementation of development programmes was affected by the delay in approval of the county budget. During this period the county was operating on Vote on Account after Governor Mike Sonko refused to sign warrants to implement the Sh37.7 billion budget. The budget stalemate left the county in a state of paralysis, which was only resolved after county assembly speaker Benson Mutura become acting governor last December. He signed the warrants that paved way for the county budget to be implemented. In the same period, City Hall spent Sh70.7 million on operations and maintenance. The report says the county spent Sh1.31 billion yet the Exchequer released Sh1.25 billion from the County Revenue Fund account. This represents 104.9 per cent of the total funds released from the CRF. Nothing was spent on recurrent expenditure by the Emergency Fund and Wards Development Fund, which have budgets of Sh100 million and Sh30 million. The county assembly spent Sh120.7 million on recurrent expenditure, Health department Sh300.7 million, Office of the Governor and Deputy Governor Sh449.7 million and Education Sh115.4 million. The Liquor Licensing Board spent Sh61.7 million on recurrent expenditure despite the Exchequer not releasing any funds since the agency always spends at source. “Analysis of expenditure by department shows that the department of Liquor Licensing Board had the highest percentage of recurrent budget at 30.8 percent while the ward development programmes and emergency fund did not report any expenditure,” reads the report. Out of the Sh1.31 billion spent by the county, Sh16 .4 million went to domestic travel, Sh9.7 million to fuel, oil and lubricants, Sh1.24 billion to employee compensation, Sh70.7 million to operations and maintenance, Sh20.3 million was spent on hospitality and Sh16.8 million on information supplies and services. The CoB report indicates Nairobi collected Sh1.54 billion as own source revenue during the July-September period. This was an increase from the Sh1.17 billion collected in the same period the previous financial year. The county government targets to raise Sh14.4 billion own-source revenue in the current financial year. “The county should devise and implement strategies to mobilize own-source revenue to ensure the approved is fully financed," reads the report. The report notes that during the same period (July - September),the county had Sh1.76 billion for budget implementation with Sh1.25 billion from the Exchequer, Sh155.6 million as balance from the previous financial year, Sh475 million as road maintenance fuel levy fund and Sh16 million for rehabilitation of village polytechnics. Others include Sh166.7 million in loans and grants from development partners, Sh61.7 million as appropriation-in-aid, Sh79.4 million as compensation for user fee foregone and Sh132 million for leasing of medical equipment.
