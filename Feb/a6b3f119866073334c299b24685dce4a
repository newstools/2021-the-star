Over the weekend, Hart The Band, in partnership with Audiomack, brought artistes and media together at the Eric Omondi Studios. Among those invited were Nadia Mukami, Breeder LW, Steph Kapela, Victoria Kimani and Kush Tracey. Band member Skoko Abednego said their aim was to make connections between artistes and the media as well. “Creative business has four parts: the artiste and their art, production, marketing and distribution and how an artiste gets revenue,” he said. Audiomack business development head Charlotte Bwana said they are providing a platform for artistes to compete with their global counterparts. “The artiste will benefit from the amplification of being in an international platform, where everybody is able to listen to them,” she said.
