The dilapidated bridge connecting Nyondia village in Gilgil with neighbouring towns is falling apart and villagers fear it could collapse sending their children to their deaths. People have been badly injured while crossing a damaged section and tens of livestock have fallen while crossing. Guardrails are missing and one section has collapsed. Villagers want Nakuru county to repair the bridge without delay and say their pleas have been ignored for years. Every day, at least 1,000 schoolchildren use the bridge built in the 1980s. Speaking during a peaceful demonstration on Thursday, residents said the bridge is a great danger and getting worse. MCA Githinji Murage called for patience, saying the county was looking for a contractor. “The county has set aside Sh149,000 to repair the bridge and those leading the demonstrations out to soil the county's name," Murage said. Villager John Ngari said the county had ignored the dangerous bridge for years. “This bridge serves over 1,000 schoolchildren every day and our efforts to have it repaired have hit a brick wall," he said. Joseph Mwaura from the Malewa oversight group said, "People are recovering at home from injuries suffered while crossing this bridge while tens of livestock have died after falling through the collapsed section. Parent Susan Wanjiku said they feared the long rains would wash away the rest of the crumbling bridge. “Our biggest fear is the minors who use this bridge and we hope our pleas will be addressed before we lose a life,” the mother said.
