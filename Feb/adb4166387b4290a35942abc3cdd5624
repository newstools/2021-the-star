Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers is confident they can complete the signing of a midfielder before the transfer deadline on Monday. Leicester, who dropped to fourth in the Premier League after Sunday’s 3-1 home defeat by Leeds United, are looking to bolster their squad following the departure of attacking midfielder Demarai Gray to Bayer Leverkusen. Dennis Praet (thigh) and Wilfred Ndidi (hamstring) are out due to injury and Rodgers is looking to provide cover for Youri Tielemans and James Maddison. Asked if he was confident a new recruit could arrive on deadline day, Rodgers told reporters: “Yes. It’ll be good for the team, we have a gap there so the club will work hard at looking to get someone in. “Our idea is to get a midfield player. If we can do that, then great.” Media reports have linked Leicester with a move for Arsenal’s Ainsley Maitland-Niles or for Watford’s Nathaniel Chalobah, who Rodgers worked with during his spell at Chelsea’s academy. “I know Nathaniel from my time working with him at Chelsea, but I know lots of players ... there are a number of players that we’re looking at,” Rodgers said.
