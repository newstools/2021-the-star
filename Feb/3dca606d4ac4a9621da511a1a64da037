Second-placed Kenya Police will on Saturday face an on-form Shabana FC at Gusii Stadium as the National Super League enters matchday 10. Police are the only unbeaten team so far while Shabana are on a six-game unbeaten run under interim coach Joseph Ongoro. Police sit second on the table with 19 points, same as leaders Talanta while Shabana are fifth with 15 points. Ongoro said he expects nothing less than a win against the law enforcers. “This is Shabana’s season. It is now or never, we have to return to the Kenyan Premier League,” said Ongoro. He said first-choice goalkeeper Elix Otieno is back from injury and disputed reports that top scorer, Kevin Omundi (with five goals ) is on his way out of the club. “All the players attended today’s training. I have not seen any transfer request from any team,” Ongoro said on Thursday. Shabana warmed up to the game against the law enforcers with a 2-1 win over National Division Two side Kiendege Jets at Kiendege playground on Thursday morning. At Camp Toyoyo grounds, Nairobi Stima welcome Silibwet Leons. Leons coach Evans Mafuta will be seeking a win against his former team. “We played well against Shabana last weekend and I’m looking forward to the game against Stima. The game against my former employers is just a game like any other,” said Mafuta. At Moi Stadium in Kisumu, newbies Kisumu Hot Stars welcome Kibera Black Stars while another newly promoted team, Soy United and APS Bomet face off at Bukhungu Stadium. Struggling Mt Kenya United and Mully Children’s Family (MCF) will clash at Camp Toyoyo as Mwatate United FC host Sony Sugar at Wundanyi Stadium.
