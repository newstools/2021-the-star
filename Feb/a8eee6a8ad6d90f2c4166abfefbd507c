Herman Humwa and Nelson Oyoo have been named co-captains of the Kenya Sevens squad for the Madrid Sevens tournament in a fortnight. Announcing the squad on Friday, head coach Innocent Simiyu said the squad is well balanced with a blend of youth and experience and will be relishing the challenge after a year of inactivity. “The boys have not played for close to a year and the two events in Madrid give us an opportunity to test our systems and see areas of improvement ahead of the Tokyo Olympics,” said Simiyu. The event in Madrid is being facilitated by World Rugby with a view to give qualified teams to the Olympics ideal preparations for the Summer Games with the Covid-19 pandemic disrupting action and the World Sevens series being postponed. Shujaa are expected to meet the likes of powerhouses New Zealand, South Africa, Fiji, Australia and Samoa. The Lionesses will be gracing the event as part of preparations for the Olympics and named their squad with Enid Ouma expected to make her debut.
