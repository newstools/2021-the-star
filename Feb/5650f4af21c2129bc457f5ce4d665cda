Google has announced the second Google News Initiative Innovation Challenge in Africa, the Middle East and Turkey. It is an open call for projects that increase reader engagement and explore new business models for the media. The Google News Initiative (GNI) works with the news industry to help journalism thrive in the digital age. “The selected projects will be funded up to $150 000, and up to 70 per cent of the total project cost,” says Ludovic Blecher, Head of Innovation, GNI. “Funding is not available for editorial projects but should instead be focused on reader engagement and exploring new business models. Google does not take any equity or IP in any projects or submissions,” he said. Organisations that can apply include established publishers, online-only players, news startups, publisher consortia and local industry associations.
