The Kenya Methodist Church presiding Bishop Joseph Ntombura has urged believers to persistently pray for the country not to return to the dark days of skirmishes. Ntombura told Christians to hold the faith and anticipate a coalition between President Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM Leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto in the coming 2022 General Elections. The president of East Africa Methodists Churches said Kenyans should not hate each other but rather be at peace because politicians root for chaos against their opponents and the next day they eat together. Speaking on Sunday in Kianjai during the installation of Harrison Mwiti as a Bishop, Ntombura said the three leaders do not want the country to go to a civil war like what happened before and during the 2007 General Elections where many people were killed and several others displaced. “What we see is the politician’s interests on how to take stock and share the wealth of this nation. They shake hands and form alignment coalitions after wrestling to discern how weighty, stronger or weaker is their opponent,” Ntombura said. He urged the believers not to take sides but to pray because politicians are intelligent. “They are not like Church divisive leaders who can even kill. Do not be surprised before 2022 if the President, Raila and Ruto agrees to share the nation’s wealth,” he said. Present during the installation was Tigania West MP John Mutunga, EALA MP Mpuru Aburi, Meru deputy governor Titus Ntuchiu and Mike Makarina. Ntombura asked congregants to embrace all politicians from all divide. “I was impressed by the statesmanship of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga on criticising laws to bar the hustler nation slogan. This shows he is a human rights defender,” he said.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
