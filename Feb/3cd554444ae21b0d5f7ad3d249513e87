Students of Moi Girls, Eldoret, have been asked to name perpetrators of the recent student strike as KCSE candidates reported back to school Thursday. The institution was indefinitely shut down on February 17 after students went on strike demanding the removal of their principal. Students accused the principal, Christine Chumba, of corruption and mismanagement, including intimidation of teachers and support staff, power outages, lack of textbooks, poor dining conditions, and general neglect of student welfare. A form presented to the students and seen by the Star contains a list of questions on the happenings of the strike. The form titled 'BOM adhoc committee confidential questionnaire' also asks the students not to reveal their identity when providing the information. It remains unclear how the information will be used by the institution leadership but it is perceived that it will be vital for reconstructing the events of the strike and redress. The Star has reached out to the institution management for a comment on the same. The information the students will be required to provide will include the ring leader of the strike, how the strike began, where and when it was planned, what caused the strike, and the role the individual student played in the strike. The school also seeks names of any teacher or non-teaching staff who might have incited the students to a strike. More to follow...
