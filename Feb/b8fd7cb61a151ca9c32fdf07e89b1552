Nigerian singer Paul Okoye, alias Rudeboy, says he started singing alone while his twin brother, Peter, popularly known as Mr P, was just a dancer. In a recent interview with Saturday Beats, Rudeboy said the issues that led to the split of the group had been around for a long time. "I started my career as a solo artiste and I had recorded several songs. My twin brother (Peter) also had a dance group, which I was part of before but I left after some time," he said. "He (Peter) was brought in (to form P-Square) to create a unique group that would be different from other groups in existence. I was singing while he would dance, and it was the idea of our elder brother, Jude. We only had a stage collaboration, not a music collaboration." He added that the division of labour they practised made P-Square. "I was in charge of singing, Peter handled the dancing aspect and stagecraft, while Jude was our manager and he directed our videos. However, it got to a point when one person started making demands and called for the sack of some members of the team," he said. "Our case is like that of a husband and wife whose marriage is not working, but they post lovely pictures on social media. People who don’t know the details would see the rosy pictures and plead for the union not to break up. But, they don’t know what is happening behind closed doors. The best thing is actually for them to go their separate ways." The duo disbanded in 2016.
