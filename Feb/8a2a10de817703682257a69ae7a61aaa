Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to spend five more nights in custody after bail ruling is pushed to Tuesday. The ruling by Magistrate Atambo on Sonko's bail application in his assault case postponed till February 9th. Magistrate says she is not ready and has not had enough time to compile the final ruling. Sonko was returned to Gigiri police station cells on Wednesday evening after being taken to Kamiti Maximum GK Prison earlier ahead of his appearance in Kiambu court on Thursday. This is after the DCI failed to be granted its request to detain Sonko for 30 days over terror-related charges. Sonko has been accused of recruiting a militia which is likely to destabilize security. An application by the DCI seeking to detain him for 30 days pending investigations cites several counts against Sonko, including his being accused of procuring uniform resembling military attire, which he has previously been spotted wearing in contravention of the rules governing its use.
