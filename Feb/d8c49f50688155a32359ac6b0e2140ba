The country is in full campaign mode, despite the general election being 18 months away. Still, this is nothing new and would in itself not cause any concern. What’s worrying is the hostilities and the class war being peddled by one camp of the political divide. The hustler vs dynasties narrative is basically a contest between the poor and the privileged. Such a provocative political tagline is worrying, especially in an unequal society such as ours that nearly descended into civil war in 2007-08 after another general election characterised by misgivings and political antagonism. We can already see some red flags. This political narrative has led to verbal and physical confrontations, some of which have ended in death. It is also distastefully making election be less about individual credentials and more about judging people’s family backgrounds, as if it is only the family factor that has made their political opponents to be who and what they are today. Ironically, most of those boastfully claiming to be self-made politicians are themselves some of the biggest beneficiaries of the big families such as the Odingas, Mois and Kenyattas–the so-called dynasties. Others, in their hostility towards their opponents, forget they are dealing with public servants who deserve respect and space to function. So, while we are a democracy, political campaigns should never be allowed to market class animosity.
