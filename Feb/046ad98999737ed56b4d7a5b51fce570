Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko was on Wednesday evening dramatically transferred to Kamiti Maximum GK Prison ahead of his appearance in Kiambu court on Thursday. One of his lawyers Assa Nyakundi said he was headed to Kamiti and was informed Sonko was scheduled to face terrorism related charges. “There is a huge traffic jam but I am told he is already at Kamiti waiting a possible arrangement. We are informed police have sworn an affidavit seeking to hold him for 30 days over terrorism-related charges,” said Nyakundi. He said police sped off from Milimani law courts and Sonko's lawyers lost track of the vehicle. Sonko is being guarded by officers from the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit. Sonko has been accused of recruiting a militia which is likely to destabilize security. An application by the DCI seeking to detain him for 30 days pending investigations cites several counts against Sonko, including his being accused of procuring uniform resembling military attire, which he has previously been spotted wearing in contravention of the rules governing its use. "That the military attire is associated with terrorist groups which pose a threat to threat to national security... and hence need to have the suspect detained for comprehensive investigations." The application follows an affidavit sworn by chief inspector Newton Thimangu. Sonko is accused of arming his personal security agents with full military attire. "That I have intelligence information that the suspect is connected to financing of terrorism activities and he is in the advanced stage of procuring arms and ammunition." "That the suspect is under investigation and is likely to be charged for very serious charges arising from the Prevention of Terrorism Act." Sonko had earlier appeared at the Milimani law courts for corruption related charges. Chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti directed that he be taken to Gigiri cells ahead of his appearance in Kiambu over his application to be released on bail.
