A potential recruit to the Kenya Defence Forces turned violent on Friday and threatened to beat up soldiers and other prospects at the Alaskan grounds in Malindi. The young man had been taken to a KDF ambulance to be attended to by medical personnel after routine physical work out. But he broke off and went to pitch where the recruitment process was ongoing and gave the youths up to 3pm to leave or face unnamed consequences. “Mnafanya nini hapa? Ikifika saa tisa bado mko hapa mtajua mini ni nani (What are you doing here? If you’re still here at three o’clock you will know who I am),” he shouted. Three officers quickly whisked him away and put him on a drip medication until he stabilised. Lt Col Christine Kuria who was in charge of the recruitment said the turnout was bigger in Malindi than anywhere else at the Coast. Hundreds of youths came to the grounds to try their luck while many others waited outside to see if their relatives would be successful. Kuria said more women will be recruited to the forces this year. “Most of the youth who turned out for the exercise met the educational requirements for recruitment but only a limited number will be taken according to the current human resource requirements,” she said. Despite the incident with the youth, Kuria said they did not get many reports of medical challenges among the prospective recruits. The recruitment drive is still ongoing nationwide.
