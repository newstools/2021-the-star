Four governors from the Coast on Wednesday held a closed-door meeting in Taita Taveta to discuss the future of the region. Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Amason Kingi (Kilifi) and Dhadho Godhana (Tana River) met at Governor Granton Samboja's Mwakishimba home in Wundanyi. However, conspicuously missing were their counterparts Salim Mvurya (Kwale) and Lamu's Fahim Twaha. Twaha and Mvurya are close allies of Deputy President William Ruto. The meeting went on late into the evening. By the time of going to press, the county chiefs had yet to come out of the meeting. Earlier, Governor Samboja said they would discuss revamping their economic bloc and pushing for development. “My friends have agreed we must leave landmark projects when our time to leave the political arena comes. The region’s economic growth will be determined by our unity and teamwork,” he said. Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani chief executive officer Emmanuel Nzai, who also attended the meeting, shared similar sentiments, saying they would deliberate on the region's economy. “I can't comment on politics. What I’m sure of is that we shall talk about revamping the economy of this region,” Nzai said. The governors were also expected to discuss the formation of the much-talked-about regional political party. The establishment of a common party has faced hitches in previous regional meetings as Joho and Kingi failed to agree on whether the region should ditch ODM. Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who is ODM party leader, enjoys massive following in the region. Joho is his deputy in the party. Kingi and Godhana are also luminaries of the Orange outfit. Mvurya, who ditched ODM for Jubilee in the lead-up to the 2017 general election, has remained tight-lipped on whether the region should have a regional party. His Lamu counterpart Twaha, also a Jubilee governor, has also not weighed in on the issue.  Edited by F'Orieny
