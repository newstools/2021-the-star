National Assembly Majority Leader Amos Kimunya has expressed confidence that MPs just like MCAs will give the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 an overwhelming endorsement. Kimunya said the House Business Committees and the two Speakers (Senate and National Assembly) will next week give the way forward in regards to the processing of the Bill which he noted will take the shortest time possible. He said the Bill will take utmost two weeks before the two Houses of Parliament. "We want to have one week of debate and by March we are through so that we go to the referendum," Kimunya said. Already, the Kipipiri MP noted the two Speakers have set a technical team that is receiving certificates from the County Assemblies that have deliberated on the Bill. Kimunya said the document carries a lot of benefits to the country and expect little resistance during the debate. On the bloated Houses as a result of gender top-ups proposed in BBI, the Majority leader said it is still open to Kenyans to amend the law and trim Parliament as they deem fit. "There is no MP who doesn't want his or her Constituency subdivided," Kimunya said. He also dismissed claims that the document is not popular amongst the people saying Kenyans will confirm the endorsement got in the Counties during the referendum. “I have been daring people to tell me what is bad in this document,” he added. President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are expected to hit the road to popularise the BBI referendum Bill from next week as they prepare for a public vote by June. The Building Bridges Initiative secretariat on Tuesday unveiled an elaborate programme in which the two leaders will hold joint rallies for the first time.
