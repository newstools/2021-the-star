Former First Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta received her 2019 Macky Sall Prize for Dialogue in Africa. She was handed the prize on Sunday by the Defence CS Monica Juma. The prize was awarded on December 2020 at the Museum of Black Civilization in Dakar, Senegal by President Macky Sall and received by the CS on her behalf. The former First Lady did not travel to Senegal to receive the prize due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The annual prize is awarded to African personalities who use dialogue to avert conflict on the continent. It is named after Senegalese President Macky Sall who is a celebrated African mediator. Mama Ngina was awarded for continuously and quietly using dialogue to diffuse tension in the country and the region over the years especially for her leading role in ending the political tension that followed Kenya's 2017 general election. Speaking when she received the award, the Former First Lady thanked CIRID for the recognition saying it was an honour for Kenya's frontline role in the search for lasting peace and stability in Eastern Africa. "I didn't know that there are people who know where we've come from as a country and how they settled on me as the recipient of the award. I am grateful," she said. At the prize handover ceremony attended by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua and Foreign Affairs PS Amb Macharia Kamau.
