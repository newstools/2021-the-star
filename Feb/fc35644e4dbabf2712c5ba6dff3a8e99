Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo has told off ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka for what he called using ODM leader Raila Odinga as their agenda. Odhiambo said while the Raila's party has no problem with the formation of the new coalition, they have an issue with their frequent attacks on the former Prime Minister. “The Mudavadi-led group by now should be thinking of how they can traverse the country to popularise their agenda and not telling Kenyans how bad ODM is,” he said. The first-term legislator said reducing their rallies to name-calling, is a demonstration they do not have any plans to transform the country. Kalonzo, Mudavadi, Moses Wetang'ula and Gideon Moi have broken up with Raila in a nasty falling out and crumbling of the once-formidable Nasa. Gideon is the Kanu boss. Odhiambo said the falling out of Nasa principals should not be breeding grounds for animosity among Raila,  Kalonzo and Mudavadi. Kalonzo and Mudavadi have been throwing barbs at Raila after he said he would not endorse any of them for president in 2022. They termed him deceitful and a conman. Odhiambo called those remarks unwarranted, saying they have no moral authority to question Raila’s honesty when they all betrayed him in 2018 in his hour of need. “The handshake deal was between those who were sworn in, not cowards who left Raila alone at Uhuru Park,” Odhiambo said. Everyone is waiting for Raila to announce his next move. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
