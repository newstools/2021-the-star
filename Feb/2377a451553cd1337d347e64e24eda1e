Ahead of the Charity Cup against Kenya Harlequins this weekend, Kabras RFC head coach Mzingaye Nyathi is confident his re-energised side will be top contenders for the trophy as well as the Kenya Cup. Nyathi said their victory on Saturday will build his charges' confidence for the rest of the season. "We just looked at what happened last season and picked up from where the club left. We are not trying to change anything. We want to win the Charity Shield first in order to build our confidence and thereafter focus on the season which we believe will be very competitive," Nyathi said. Kabras have been working hard in training to improve on their use of space and enhance cohesiveness as a team. "At the moment,we are training on how to utilise space well and convert opportunities. These are the attributes that will see us perform well, but generally, the team is in good shape and ready to go. Our biggest focus is for each player to understand his role,” Nyathi said. The Zimbabwean was speaking on Thursday morning during the official launch of the club’s new kit at Kakamega Showground. Skipper Dan Sikuta said he cannot wait for the season to begin. Edwin Musonye, who spoke on behalf of the sponsors, Kabras Sugar, assured the players and the technical bench of the company's total support.
