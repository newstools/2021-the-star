President Uhuru Kenyatta has postponed his meeting with Clergy and Women Leaders from Central Kenya. The meeting that was scheduled for Monday at Sagana State Lodge was postponed to next week due to unavoidable circumstances. State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena said the new date and venue of the rescheduled meetings will be communicated in due course. This comes days after the president met Mt Kenya leaders at Sagana in a bid to quell the tension in the area and sell BBI. During his tour, Uhuru gave yet another indication that he might not support his deputy William Ruto when he told a parked delegation in Sagana that he owes no one. Speaking on Saturday when he met 5000 delegates from Mt Kenya region, the President said he is only indebted to the millions of Kenyans. “Some people keep saying I made a promise to them. No, I only have a promise and covenant with the people of Kenya,” the President said. The two leaders campaigned on a platform of Uhuru serving two terms and supporting DP for another two terms. Saturday's statement is a complete departure from his Friday’s statement when he appeared to be reinforcing his 2013 commitment of backing his deputy. On Friday, Uhuru told MCAs from the 10 counties of Central Kenya that he has never said he will not support his deputy.
