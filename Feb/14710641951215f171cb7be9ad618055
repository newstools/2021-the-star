Kenyan politics is as interesting as it is predictable. The so-called Digital Duo Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto were joined at the hip, or so we thought, and beat Raila Odinga in two elections. In these campaigns, they threw all sorts of insults at the ODM leader. He responded in kind. Alongside him were Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi. Now, Uhuru and Raila are now in one camp, and have edged out Ruto from government although not officially. On the other hand, Kalonzo and Mudavadi are joined against Raila over past MoUs. Same can be linked to UhuRuto fallout. These realignments are not new though. They remind us of the 2002, 2007, 2013 elections. As they say, in politics, there are no permanent enemies just interests. I urge Kenyans to follow Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago’s advice: Don’t put politics in the heart. Put it in the lungs so that you just have to breathe it out. Michael Muriithi, Nairobi-based writer
