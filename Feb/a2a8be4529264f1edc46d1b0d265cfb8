A doctor has sued the government over its decision to issue MCAs with car grant. Dr Magare Gikenyi wants the court to stop the implementation of the car grant saying it is illegal. The grant was given following president Uhuru Kenyatta's directive. He argued that the MCAs offered themselves for office without being coerced and therefore they should not turn around and arm twist Kenyans or any government office. "...they should not blackmail Kenyans and other government offices to accept their personal issues choreographed as national interest," he said. The little resources the country has, he said, should be utilized for other priority things and not car grant for MCAs. More to follow
