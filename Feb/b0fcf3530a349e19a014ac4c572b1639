Everton forward Cenk Tosun has rejoined his former club Besiktas on loan until the end of the season, the Turkish side said. Tosun moved to Everton in January 2018 on a 4-1/2 year deal for a fee of around 27 million pounds ($37.07 million) but has failed to cement his place in the team, scoring 11 goals in 58 matches in all competitions. He had a short loan spell at Crystal Palace last year before returning to Everton in March after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The 29-year-old has made five league appearances for Everton this season, all as a substitute. Tosun scored 41 goals in 96 Turkish Super Lig games for Besiktas. Elsewhere, Manchester United youngster Facundo Pellistri has joined La Liga side Alaves on loan for the rest of the season, the Premier League club said on Sunday. The 19-year-old Uruguayan forward has yet to make a first-team appearance for United, having joined them from Penarol in October for a reported 9 million pounds ($12.34 million). After featuring for Unitedâ€™s Under-23 side, Pellistri will now head to Spain in a bid to gain regular first-team experience with Alaves, who are involved in a relegation battle.
