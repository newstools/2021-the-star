Leaders in Kisii have urged the government to complete Suneka Airstrip in Bonchari in honour of MP Oroo Oyioka who died Sunday last week. Only the first phase of the project has been completed. Work on the airstrip started in 2015. At least Sh195 million has been expended on the project. The upgrade of the airstrip was allocated a total of Sh235 million. On Sunday, MPs Joash Nyamoko (West Mugirango), Alfa Miruka (Bomachoge Chache), Ezekiel Machogu (Nyaribari Masaba) and Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi said Oyioka was a development-conscious person and the airstrip had a special place in his heart. They said it was crucial that the remaining part of the project is done in his honour. “We have a lot to benefit from its operations,” Nyamoko said. Construction at the site has been on and off since 2015 with constant stand-offs between the contractor and the government. Currently, only the pavilion, perimeter fence and guest lounge have been completed and have been handed over to the Kenya Airports Authority. The MPs, who spoke after touring the facility, said the runaway remains the most crucial part of  the project so that the airstrip can be operationalised as soon as possible. Gusii Elders Council chairman James Matundura and council secretary Samuel Bosire made similar calls. He said had the airstrip been done, dignitaries travelling for the burial of the MP would have used it. “With jams on our roads, I am sure the airstrip could have come in handy,” Matundura said. Evangelical Alliance Kisii region chairman Charles Isaboke said the government should check out other projects that may be abandoned now that the MP has died. He said many predecessors in Kenya often start new projects and leave the stalled ones and thus the projects fail to give value to mwananchi. “There are pending projects which may be abandoned altogether by whoever is coming in. As church leaders, we ask the government to ensure they are finished,” he told the Star in his office.
