Kenyan international midfielder Elly Asieche has joined Wazito exactly a day after parting ways with Sofapaka. The moneybags unveiled the striker alongside custodian Levis opiyo who joins the club from reigning champions Gor Mahia, striker Erick Otieno (Nzoia Sugar) and John Odhiambo from disbanded National Super League side, Ushuru. Asieche left Sofapaka in a huff amidst claims he had grown increasingly unhappy at the club since the arrival of coach Ken Odhiambo from Bandari a month ago. He had previously also turned out for KCB  and Kariobangi Sharks and was handed his first senior call up by Harambee Stars coach Jacob 'ghost' Mulee. The midfielder has vowed to propel the FKF-PL returnees to their maiden top tier title. “Wazito was an easy choice because it is a team with a good structure. I also have friends in the team and I felt that it would help me settle down easily. I am here to create and score goals for the team. I am also excited to work with coach Francis Kimanzi who understands me and I will give my best in Wazito colours,” he stated. CEO Dennis Gicheru showered Asieche with a lot of paraise, saying he had the qualities coach Kimanzi was looking for to fire up his midfield. “He is a quality midfielder. He brings a wealth of experience to the team and I am confident he will thrive here. The coach recommended that we get him because he knows his qualities and we are glad to have him here. He makes our team stronger,” CEO Dennis Gicheru said.
