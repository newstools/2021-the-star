The maize balance sheet projected to end of March 2021 has shown that the country will have a surplus of about 11.03 million bags. This is owing to 2020 long and ongoing short rains harvest and imports according to January Food and Nutrition Security report released by the Ministry of Agriculture. The report indicated that the surplus is based on estimated 300,000 bags of imports by millers from the region, and from the ongoing long rains harvest and part of short rains harvest from the Western of the Rift Valley regions. “Stocks of maize as at end of January were 18.8 million bags of 90kgs. Estimated maize imports by the private sector and relief agencies from the region between February to April was 300,000 bags, while the estimated 2020 short rains harvest was 4.2 million bags,” the report stated. It indicated that prices of most food commodities are still within the normal range, although prices of maize and rice have started showing upward trends due to increased demand. In January 2021, KNBS reported a very small increase in the Consumer Price Index changing to 112.58 points, up from 111.87 points in December 2020. “The imports of most commodities remained low compared to previous years, with wheat, in particular, experiencing lowest imports, which is attributed to reduced global supply of wheat." “Harvesting of maize in the major unimodal growing zones in the North Rift and upper Western regions was ongoing but drying of maize is likely to be marred by heavy rains currently being experienced across the regions,” the report says. With regards to short rains season performance, Nyanza, Western, central Rift and parts of Central regions experienced moderate performance of most food crops and harvesting is complete in most of these counties. “However, in the Coast, Eastern, North Eastern and parts of Central, delayed planting due to delayed rains and poor rainfall distribution has led to overall poor performance of most food crops. Production decline in these counties is between 40 to 60 per cent of long term average and harvesting is expected to commence by end of February to mid-March 2021,” the report reads.
