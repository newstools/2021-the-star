Controversial singer Muigai wa Njoroge on Tuesday accused the government of neglecting musicians while they are alive. Expressing his condolences to the family of Mighty Salim, Muigai said Kenyan artistes are suffering a lot, despite being in the industry for a long time. Muigai talked about the Skiza issue, where musicians don't receive what they deserve. Musicians get paid 26 per cent, with the government taking 60 per cent and Safaricom 14 per cent. "It is unfortunate that taxes charged on our music eat up more than what ends up in the pocket of an artiste. This is an industry that has been neglected as the government focuses on other sectors, such as games, farming and sports," Muigai said. Muigai said in most cases, a harambee is done to raise funds to bury an artiste after they die and they leave their children without any investment. "Our only mission on earth is to sing and our talent needs to feed our children even when we are gone. No musician is supposed to die and leave their wife being fed by other men and school fees being borrowed for their children." Muigai added that a musician is supposed to remain as respected as he was even while he was alive. "I wish Mighty's music can support his family." The singer also said politicians have started inviting musicians planning to use their music during campaigns. "Some were invited by ODM leader Raila, led by Ben Githae, and I was also invited by the Deputy President. But my wish is that they will also remember us after the campaigns," Muigai said. "When we die, they come. So even while we are still alive, they should not forget us." Singer Samidoh also weighed in on the issue, noting that musicians live an impoverished life that only comes to the forefront when they die. "Our problems are many, but it is always assumed we are living a good life. On the contrary, our lives in poverty are exposed when we fall ill or die, and those around us cannot even raise funds to settle accompanying bills."
