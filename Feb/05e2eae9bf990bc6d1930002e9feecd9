Oserian Ladies team are targeting attacking reinforcements in the current transfer window to boost their chances of survival in the Football Kenya Federation Women's Premier League. The Naivasha-based side earned their first point of the season in a 1-1 draw against Trans-Nzoia Falcons on Saturday but are still in the relegation battle. The Hudson Odari-coached side are seventh in Zone 'B', one place above bottom-placed Eldoret Falcons. Oserian play Falcons this weekend in a must-win match according to the tactician. Oserian have only scored twice in six matches with one game left before the first leg ends. The team is in dire need of scorers and Odari wants fresh blood to shore up his blunt attack. "We have a decent team but our greatest problem has been scoring. We have failed to finish off our chances which have ultimately contributed to the team being punished on the other end. We have identified players who will lift the mood of the team in the forward positions and we hope to have them on board as soon as possible," he observed. "Falcons are no pushovers but our target is to record victory at all costs." At the same time, Odari wants his defence to be resolute and watertight. Statistics paint a negative picture for Oserian, who have shipped in 16 goals. "Defensive fragility has been one of the negatives in the team but the playing unit is slowly getting their act together. We have to do well at both ends of the field," Odari remarked. Oserian will also strengthen in midfield should resources allow.
