Naivasha High court has found police officer Evans Wiyema Maliecha guilty of murdering a fisherman. Constable Maliecha was accused of shooting dead the fisherman in 2014 for allegedly stealing sheep worth Sh10,000. Maliecha is accused of murdering Moses Kinyanjui Wanyoike on July 27, 2014. "Given all the foregoing circumstances and my findings, I find and hold that the accused acted with men's rear, recklessly and in violation of the law. His actions were made all the more unacceptable by the fact that he did not report the incident but instead chose to assist in prosecuting the fishermen," Judge Richard Mwongo said. "His actions do not add up and do not support the defense of self-defense. Ultimately I find the accused guilty of murder and convict him for the same." The case has been on since 2016. He's to be sentenced in mid next month. On the day Wanyoike was killed, he and two other fishermen - Johnson Ndichu and Douglas Tutu were fishing at Crescent Island, Lake Naivasha when the officer shot him in the head at close range. A day before the killing, a sheep belonging to Crescent Island had been reported missing. Maliecha and a colleague allegedly had gone to pursue suspects when they sighted the three fishermen and shot at them, instantly killing Moses. Following the incident and in a bid to conceal the truth, the officer charged Johnson and Douglas with theft of a sheep worth Sh10,000.
