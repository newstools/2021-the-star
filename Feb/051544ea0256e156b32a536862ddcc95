ODM on Thursday extended the deadline for aspirants wishing to fly its flag in the 2022 presidential elections in what insiders linked to the upcoming by-elections. National Elections Board chairperson Catherine Mumma announced extension of the exercise. Raila who is widely expected to fly the Orange colours has not submitted his application as well as Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Only Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho had done so. The board did not give reasons for its last minute action, but insiders told the Star the move was to accommodate Oparanya who is engaged in the Matungu by-election. Oparanya has been leading campaigns for Matungu candidate David Were in the by-elections slated for March 4. “Oparanya has been leading our campaigns in Matungu and given the nature of campaigns there it has not been possible to come and file the forms,” an official in the party told the Star. ODM national chairman John Mbadi said the decision was to give some interested candidates more time to apply. “Some interested candidates asked for more time,” Mbadi said on phone. On Thursday, elections chairperson Mumma announced that interested applicants have up to March 31 to submit their letters. “Further to the notice of the National Elections Board of 21st January 2021 calling for the submission of applications by individuals interested in consideration as the ODM party presidential candidate for the 2022 general elections, this is to extend the deadline for the submission of applications from 26th February 2021 to 31st march 2021,” Mumma said. “All interested interest candidates are required to submit their application in the prescribed manner.” Edited by Henry Makori
