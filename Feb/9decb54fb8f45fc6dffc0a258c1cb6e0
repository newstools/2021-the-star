Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) will offer grants to clubs to conduct Covid-19 tests in readiness for the season restart at the end of the month. KRU chairman, Oduor Gangla, yesterday said the grants will cushion clubs from the adverse effects of the pandemic which has hit them hard. "Yes we are assisting clubs with some monies to do the tests as part of our sponsorship. We know the tests are very prohibitive and therefore, we are doing everything we can to assist the Kenya Cup sides,” added KRU boss. Gangla said the union is working with various partners to assist the clubs to conduct Covid-19 tests as well as adopting a multi-faceted approach . "We have spoken to Nairobi Metropolitan Service and Kenya Medical Research Institute to help with the tests at a good rate. Some clubs have already conducted the tests and we hope in the course of the week, others will follow suit,” he added. The Kenya Cup league will start on February 27 after the sport was given the green light to resume by the Ministry of Sport. The start of the league will be preceded by the championship playoffs slated for this weekend. Mean Machine hosts Egerton University with the winner taking on Masinde Muliro University in the semis slated for February 13 . United States International University take on Northern Suburbs with Strathmore Leos awaiting in the final four. The semi-final winners replace Western Bulls and Kisumu RFC who were relegated from Kenya Cup. Kenya Cup champions KCB will face Enterprise Cup holders Kabras in the Charity Cup on February 20. Gangla said they will announce  the head coach and management of the Kenya Under-20 team as well as conduct the selection exercise this week.  “We will announce the team very soon so that we can start our preparations for the Africa Under-20 Championship which we are hosting," he noted. Kenya hosted the 2019 edition, beating Namibia 21-18 in the final to qualify for the Junior World Rugby Trophy in Brazil, where they wounded up fifth.
