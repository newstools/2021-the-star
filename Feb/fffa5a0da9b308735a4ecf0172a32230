Suna West MP Peter Masara and his Rongo counterpart Paul Abuor have called on DP William Ruto to resign for undermining his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta. Speaking on Friday during a fundraiser in aid of boda boda riders in Rongo town, the ODM legislators accused Ruto of preaching divisive politics and making irresponsible utterances against the President. They said Ruto should resign and vacate his post for defying his boss and maintaining his hustler narrative. The DP is traversing the nation inciting citizens to reject amendments to the 2010 Constitution as proposed by the BBI task force, they said. “Ruto lacks respect to the President and should not be allowed to continue clinging to the same post to antagonise his boss,” Masara said. Masara said Ruto quit Jubilee Party and its administration and focus on his UDA party. “He should do that instead of sabotaging his boss'es efforts to unite the nation ahead of next year's election,” Masara said. Abuor, for his part, urged government agencies to investigate Ruto for constantly using the hustler-dynasty narrative, which he said will cause tension and violence ahead of 2022 election. The two legislators said Ruto’s hustler’s politics is misleading unemployed citizens  as his promises of goodies will never be fulfilled just as he did during the last election campaigns.
