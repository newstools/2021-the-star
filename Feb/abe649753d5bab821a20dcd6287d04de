Kiambu police are seeking a tea worker who allegedly killed his girlfriend for not preparing his favourite ugali for lunch. Lari subcounty police commander Charles Opondo said on Wednesday she was battered, then her hands were severely stabbed so she bled to death. The death occurred Wednesday in Kamahindu village in Lari subcounty. Police did not immediately identify the suspect or his 45-year-old girlfriend. She screamed for help, her boyfriend ran away and neighbours were trying to stop the bleeding, a neighbour said. "We heard screams of the lady, and we came to check. They live in different plots but visit each other," neighbour Simon Njoroge said. "The lady said the boyfriend complained of hunger and confronted her because she had not cooked his favourite meal of ugali," he added. Residents rushed the woman to Nazareth Hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival from loss of blood. "The hands had not been chopped off but she had deep stab injuries and lost a lot of blood," Opondo said. He said police were investigating to determine if something besides ugali was the cause of the killing. "We have not apprehended the suspect, but we are following him very closely and soon he will be arrested" Opondo said. Voice of Men and Children national chairman Bishop James Njenga said young and middle-aged men need to be counselled over marital and courtship issues. "Our society is ailing because most of our middle-aged and young couples, whether married or not, cannot handle each other's challenges, feelings and ways of doing things," the bishop said. Njenga urged church leaders to hold seminars for married and unmarried couples The body was taken to Nazareth Hospital mortuary. (Edited by V. Graham)
