It was an extraordinary weekend for Kabras Sugar as the Kabras Rugby Football Club (RFC) won Sisimuka Charity Cup whereas Kabras Sugar Racing Team excelled in round one of the Kenya National Rally Championship (KNRC). Kabras Sugar RFC were in a class of their own as they thumped Kenya Harlequins 29-10 in the curtain raiser match at Nyayo Stadium on Saturday. Jonah Kubu — better known as 'The Witch of Kakamega' — was named man of the match for his constant rampages deep into Quins' defensive territory. They now shift their focus to the 2021 Kenya Cup season beginning next weekend where the millers face debutants Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology at the Kakamega Showground. Kabras are top contenders for the title in which they were leading last year before Covid-19 halted sporting activities in the country. Even though the match will be held behind closed doors, the players promised to give it their all in the match and repay the faith shown by their fans and sponsor. On the same day, the racing team swept all the podium places in the KNRC season opener in Nakuru. Defending champion Baldev Chager and Ravi Soni finished first ahead of Tejveer Rai/Gareth Dawe and Onkar Rai/Drew Sturrock. The racing team has now shifted its focus to Leg Two of this year’s Rally Championship slated for next month.
