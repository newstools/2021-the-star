Kakamega residents and their neighbors will in a few months time start enjoying aircraft travels as the rehabilitation of the Kakamega airstrip is headed to completion. The Kenya Airports Authority is rehabilitating and upgrading an Airstrip situated in Shinyalu constituency at a cost of Sh174.7 million. The proposed rehabilitation works involve full reconstruction of a two Kilometer runway and construction of a new Apron and Patrol road. Speaking during the inspection tour of the facility  Kenya Airports Authority Alex Gitari said he was impressed by the progress of the construction work at the airstrip noting that it won’t go beyond the timelines. “We are delighted the contractor is doing a very good job and are looking forward to the completion of the project. We expect to handover to our stakeholders by September this year to commence operations.” The objective is to develop the Airstrip Aircraft Pavements to Bituminous standards so as to accommodate Code 1C Aircraft in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards. The upgraded Airstrip will not only unlock the potential economic activities of the Western Region but also enhance the transport connectivity circuit within its environs. Inspection of construction of Kakamega Airstrip is part of a countrywide tour by KAA Management to inspect the ongoing works across airstrips. The Airstrips include Kitale, Migori and Suneka.
