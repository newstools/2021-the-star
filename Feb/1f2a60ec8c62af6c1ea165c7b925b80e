Rapper Khaligraph Jones and comedian Eric Omondi are set for a boxing match on February 23. Speaking about the invite-only event, Omondi said, "It is supposed to be 12 rounds of boxing. It will only take me one to take down Khaligraph Jones." Adding, "It took David a few seconds to bring down Goliath, so just like David, It will take me 15 seconds. I've bought a coffin and I've spoken to Lang'ata cemetery." Khaligraph, on the hand, is determined to beat Omondi and so are the fans. The two planned the fight after their online blows on who is more built than the other. This is after Eric gained 26kg. Omondi says he has been training for that day. "I train three hours daily and eat eight meals a day. I've not had sex for three months in preparation for that."
