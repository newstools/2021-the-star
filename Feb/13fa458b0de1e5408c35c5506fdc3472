Kenya will host Africa Under-20 Rugby championship from March 25 to April 4 in Nairobi. The event, also known as Barthez Cup, was earlier slated for last year in March but was cancelled due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The country is scheduled to host the event for the next three years after a successful event in 2019. The winner will qualify for the Junior Rugby World Trophy slated for September at a venue to be announced by later. The Kenya side, popularly known as Chipu, won the last edition on home soil beating powerhouses Namibia 21-18 in the final to qualify for the Junior Rugby World Trophy in Brazil, where they finished fifth in the tournament. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman, Oduor Gangla, said the squad's composition will be known this month and expressed confidence that the selected players can do the country proud and qualify for the world event. “We want to have consistency in that event and qualify for the world show again  while at the same time building a platform for youngsters who can graduate to the senior in the years to come,” he noted. Only four players from the 2019 squad are eligible for selection for this year's event. They include George Kiriazi,  Owain Ashley, Mureiithi Mwiti and Lorence Ishuga. Elsewhere, the Singapore and Hong Kong legs have been moved to October from their traditional dates in April due to the the Covid- 19 pandemic. The new dates are October 29-30 and  November 5-7 respectively with Hong Kong acting as the Series' finale. A further update on contingency schedule for this year's  HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series 2021 will be announced soon with a return to a full competition schedule anticipated for the 2022 edition.
