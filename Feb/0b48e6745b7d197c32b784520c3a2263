A U.S based court in Philadelphia has sentenced a man to 15 years in Prison for abusing minors at a Kenyan orphanage. Gregory Dow, 61, was sentenced on Thursday for defiling children in need of care and protection in Kenya. The court also handed him eight more months in Prison and a lifetime of supervised release. In an announcement made by acting United States Attorney Jennifer Arbittier Williams, Dow was also ordered to pay over Sh1.7 Million in restitution. Dow is accused of sexually assaulting four girls between 2013 and 2017 while running Dow Family Children's Home in Boito, Bomet county, which he established in 2008. He, however, fled the country in 2017 after police were tipped of the illegal acts at the orphanage which has since been closed. Dow admitted to abusing the girls in multiple attacks. He had established the Childrenâ€™s Home under the guise of Christianity, with financial support from Churches and Faith-based organizations from the U.S. Prosecutors said his wife even took his victims to a medical clinic for birth control implants, "which allowed Dow to perpetrate his crimes without fear of impregnating his victims."
