Meru artists have criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta for failing to meet them at Sagana State Lodge or inviting them to other events during his four-day visit to Mt Kenya. Led by their chairman Wycliffe Muthomi, the artists said they were ignored despite their role in Uhuru's ascent to the presidency. “How can we be denied a chance to perform or even attend the meeting yet we campaigned for President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2013 and 2017?” Muthomi said. Muthomi blamed Meru leaders who were part of those that organised Uhuru's tour of the region. “We are not happy at all with what happened in Sagana and our leaders should know that,” he said. Muthomi said most artists are depressed and some have even committed suicide due to lack of income as tough Covid-19 rules forbade public performances and shut down bars and restaurants. “We are seeing politicians doing events but when artists do events they are arrested. That is a double standard of the highest level. We want to be allowed to hold shows and we are ready to meet the guidelines,” he said. Gospel artist Dayo Kim said musicians from Meru are not cheap and cannot be taken for granted. “We can even teach BBI to residents; they should not take us as pushovers,” she said. Kennedy Kiambi, a dancer, said it is not the first time the President and his handlers have snubbed them. “We have seen even in Meru local event organisers bringing people from outside yet we have all tools in the entertainment industry including sound and even roadshow vans and lorries,” Kiambi said.
