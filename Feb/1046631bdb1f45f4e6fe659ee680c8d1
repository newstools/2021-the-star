The women’s FIBA-Africa Club Championship hangs in the balance following the withdrawal of Egypt as the hosts. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) secretary, Ambrose Kisoi, yesterday confirmed the development, saying FIBA-Africa are trying to get a new host. “We are now waiting for a new development,” said Kisoi. National champions Equity Bank and Kenya Ports Authority will represent the country in the festival earlier slated for March 12-20. The two giants got a bye to play in the championship after they emerged as the only teams to have confirmed participation in the regional tournament. The Zone Five Club tournament was planned for Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania last year but was cancelled due to Covid-19 pandemic. KPA coach Anthony Ojukwu said he is awaiting the official word before disbanding his team.
