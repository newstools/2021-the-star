Anna Muthangya, 12, developed heart problems three years ago. Her parents rushed her to a private hospital in Mwingi and that's where their heartrending journey began. The family is from Mui, Mwingi East in Kitui county. Both parents are unemployed. Her father Stephen Muthangya said his youngest daughter's grades dropped and she stopped playing with friends. Sometimes, she suddenly stopped walking and sat down. Her heart pounded hard and fast - it produced a strange sound that others could hear. They were referred to Mater Hospital in Nairobi where Anna was given heart medication. On October 19 last year, her condition worsened. She was rushed to  Hurlingham Heart Clinic and was diagnosed with severe mitral valve leaking, severe pulmonary hypertension and  rheumatic heart disease. On January 14 this year the father of four took Anna to KNH for cheaper medication. He was referred to an Indian specialty hospital where treatment and surgerywill cost Sh1.5 million, plus expenses. Surgery is scheduled for March 8 but Anna's family is unable to raise the amount, while his daughter's condition worsens. Anna's mother, Meridian Muthangya, said her daughter hardly eats and has trouble breathing. At times her body colour changes, becoming darker and bluish. “I sleep with her in my arms, and most nights I never find sleep,” her mother said. She implored well-wishers to help her take Anna to India for treatment, saying the family cannot raise enough money through harambees. "We have not gotten any substantial amount, as people say times are hard, and there is no money due to the Covid-19 pandemic," Meridian said. The family has three other children in school and raising fees is difficult as both parents are unemployed. (Edited by V. Graham)
