Makueni Boys School in Makueni County has suspended all its 258 Form Four students, for a period of two weeks for refusal to shave and assaulting their principal, Makueni County Police Commander Joseph Naypean has confirmed. According to Makueni Police, the incident was reported at around 8.45 pm on Friday. It was reported that the unrest started on Friday after 255 Form Four students refused to shave their heads as a routine barber exercise in the school and started pelting the school premises with stones. The school principal sustained injuries after he was pelted with stones on the head but was later treated and discharged. Speaking to the Star the school Principal Raphael Diwan said the unrest started after most of the Form Four Students refused to have their hair shaved claiming it is too cold. "As routine management, all students have their heads shaved every month. But Friday only three Form Four students shaved their head and others refused claiming that it is too cold." Said Mr Diwani. He said he called his deputy teacher to try to calm the boys down but one of the students hit him on the head leaving him with a minor injury. Diwan said they called police officers from Makueni Station who took them into the social hall where they slept the whole night under their supervision. "When we discussed the issue with officers from the Ministry of Education we decided that all 258 students should go home for two weeks as investigations continue," Said Diwan. He added the school management and ministry of education will sit down to access the damage following the unrest. The headteacher also said every parent will accompany their boy with all school fee balance saying that the Form Four students alone have a fee balance of Sh3.3 million.
