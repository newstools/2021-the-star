Five Nyamira County Executives who were dismissed by Governor Amos Nyaribo want the county chief committed to jail for failing to obey court orders reinstating them. The former executive committee members procured orders requiring the Governor and six other respondents to appear before the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kericho after they reportedly disobeyed orders that reinstated the officers back to their respective offices. The five: Douglas Bosire (Health), Zablon Onchiri (Lands and Physical Planning), Bernard Osumo (Public Adminiistration), Muga Omwanza (Public Works) and John Omanwa (Finance and Planning) moved to court where they formally lodged the contempt of court proceedings against Nyaribo, County Secretary James Ntabo and five others. The former executives were rendered jobless early January after the death of former Governor John Nyagarama on December 18, 2020. They moved to court to contest their dismissal which they termed illegal. The court gave conservatory orders and ordered that they be reinstated pending determination of their suit. But according to the contempt suit, the County Secretary, James Ntabo has denied them entry into the offices and instead likened the court battle which they initiated to a farting donkey. "In total disregard of the Court's orders, of January 18, the first respondent (Governor), in complete defiance while addressing media on application quest and this instant suit, he likened the proceedings hereof to a farting donkey," the affidavit that was signed by the applicants' legal representatives Wamuyu and Company Advocates read in part. The matter is set to be heard with both parties present on Thursday at the Kericho Law Courts.
