Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna has pleaded with students to stop burning down school properties and save parents the agony of paying more money. Speaking at Kakululo Secondary School where he opened a new dormitory, Nguna said parents sacrifice a lot to have students in school. “I urge you to save your parents from the agony of contributing more money in school, especially during these hard times occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic,” Nguna told students. There has been a wave of burning of schools in the country. “Please, even if you feel uncomfortable in school, find peaceful ways of solving with the administration but do not destroy school properties,” he said. He also told the students to be obedient and disciplined, and remember the hardships their parents are going through to have them in school. He added that Kakululo students should not emulate what other schools are doing by destroying properties as violence is not a way of solving issues. Addressing parents who were also present during the function, the legislator told them to instill discipline in their children.
