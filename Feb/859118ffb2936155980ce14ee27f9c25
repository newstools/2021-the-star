Ali Kiba's mother has confirmed in an interview that the singer and his Kenyan wife Amina Khalef have taken a break. Mama Kiba in an interview with Clouds Media said Amina is back to Mombasa, her parent's home. "My daughter-in-law is on a love break," she said. "She went to see her parents. Yes, she is in Mombasa. "Just like you take breaks in work, you can also take a break to go see your mother." Asked how often Mrs Kiba goes to her parent's home, Mama Ali Kiba said, "She and her husband agreed on when she should do that." Last year during an interview, Kiba said he and his wife have never parted ways since they got married in 2018. Kiba said every time the allegations surfaced, he and his wife were going strong but nobody believed him. "She has always been around. Why do you think so? Is it because youâ€™ve seen photos? We are very much okay. I have always told you that but you never believed me," he said. A while back, Kiba also released a song that seemed to have been dedicated to Amina, who was rumoured to have left her matrimonial home and moved back to Kenya just one year into their marriage. Commenting on the issue, the 'Dodo' crooner said his beloved wife has the freedom to live wherever she wants to.
