A supporter of Ford Kenya candidate in the Kabuchai MP by-election Majimbo Kasinga on Tuesday night was attacked and injured by people he claimed to be from his rivals. Over 50 men armed with crude weapons waylaid Majimbo's convoy as he was going home. They attacked and seriously injured a supporter popularly known as Junior in the head. He was taken to Chwele Health Centre. Majimbo condemned the incident, saying it was a sign of cowardice from his rivals. "We want police to move with speed and arrest the culprits who are well-known,'' Majimbo said. United Democratic Alliance (UDA) candidate Evans Kakai also called on police to investigate the incident. There had been claims that Majimbo's supporter had been attacked by people allied to Kakai and another candidate. But Kakai denied the claims, saying he would never plan or think about attacking his fellow candidates. "We do not condone violence of any nature and wish to condemn the incident, if true, in the strongest possible terms. Further, we wish to call for a speedy investigation into the matter," he said. Kakai said they were aware that such schemes have been used in the past to win sympathy votes and mete violence against opponents on the pretext of revenge. "Let us await a report from the security agencies on the incident since my name has been mentioned in the disturbing Facebook post by Majimbo," he said. The Kabuchai by-election is slated for March 4. It was occasioned by the death of MP James Mukwe late last year.
