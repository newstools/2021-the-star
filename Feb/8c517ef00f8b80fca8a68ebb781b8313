Fast-rising all-girl music duo The Band Beca has officially dropped their debut album, 'Beca Fever'. It is dedicated to smart, hardworking and beautiful African women out there who are not afraid to go for what they want and believe in. "Beca Fever tackles women empowerment, confidence, bravery and body shaming," the duo say. The nine-track album revolves around the stories and experiences of different women who inspired them and upped the temperatures in the industry as the title of the album suggests. "'Watch Your Mouth', for instance, speaks of how the girl group had been looked down upon and judged as they took a break to re-strategise, a thing that happens to many other females who, as a result, give up easily on their hustle." The album was executively produced by Naiboi Worldwide and directed by Rodrick Robert (Fally).
