Grammy-nominated artiste Niniola has released 'Promise'. This is the first single of her most anticipated EP, called 6th Heaven. "As promised, it's coming," she wrote on Instagram. â€œ6th Heaven The Ep. Pure R&B tracklist. It's Love. It's Heartbreak. It's Sacrifice." The self-proclaimed Queen Of Afro-House went on to say that "My R&B fans have been starved for a long time, I just felt it was time to feed them and show them I still love them." 'Promise' was produced by DJ Rombee of alternate sound and is a song about a love experience that went sour. Her EP is a five-track project that is coming soon. The Nigerian artiste first made headlines after finishing as third runner-up in the sixth season of Project Fame West Africa.
