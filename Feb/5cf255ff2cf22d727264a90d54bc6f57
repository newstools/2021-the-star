ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has been urged not to disappoint the Luhya community after elders from Western endorsed him to run for the presidency. Bishop Charles Sande of Upendo Pentecostal church said Mudavadi should stamp his authority on Luhya land as Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka have done in their regions. “Mudavadi should not take his endorsement for granted. He should put the Luhya community on the Kenyan map as one of the communities that has produced a president,” Sande said. He spoke to the Star on the phone. Sande urged Mudavadi to seek support from across the country as Luhyas alone cannot propel him to the top seat. “We have hopes that he can make it to the top seat considering his political experience and his service in government." Sande’s remarks come after elders in the Western region endorsed Mudavadi as the region's flagbearer for the 2022 presidential race. Led by their chairman, Philip Masinde, the elders said the region must form the government or be part of the government come 2022. Mudavadi has already declared his candidature for the top seat, saying he won’t leave anything to chance. “It’s my time to take the gun and shoot, and I am not reversing from that at any point,” Mudavadi said during his endorsement by elders. ANC deputy party leader Ayub Savula said the party's constitution does not allow Mudavadi to deputise anybody. “If Mudavadi deputises other people, he will be going against our party constitution, which does not give him that room,” Savula told the Star. He said if Mudavadi wants to deputise someone else, he is free to do so but not under the ANC party. "Our constitution, as the ANC party, only allows our party leader to contest for the top seat and not deputise other candidates," Savula said on the phone.
