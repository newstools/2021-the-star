Shujaa will open their inaugural Madrid Sevens campaign against France when the World Rugby invitational begins on Saturday. Later in the day, the Kenyans will play Portugal and USA before tackling hosts Spain and Argentina a day later in the round-robin tournament. The top four teams will then proceed to the knockout rounds. Head coach Innocent Simiyu said they expect a tough outing but insisted his boys are ready for the challenge ahead. "This is the kind of competition we want to test ourselves. We have not played for nine months and it will take a while to get going but we want to test our systems and structures and see where we are before we go to Tokyo (for the delayed 2020 Olympic Games in July),” added Simiyu. Simiyu has made one change to the squad with Andrew Amonde dropped after falling ill and missing training for a week. He has been replaced by Bush Mwale. Simiyu said every side will be starting from scratch and termed the event as 'wide open'. "Whoever will settle quickly will carry the day. All the teams are rusty due to lack of playtime and it will boil down to who will execute better in both attack and defence,” noted Simiyu. Shujaa, a blend of youth and experience, held their final training session on Thursday. "I want to give everyone a chance to prove themselves and we see some combinations in the side,” observed Simiyu. The Lionesses will play USA, France, Russia, Spain and Poland in the women’s competition. Other build-up tournaments lined up include Dubai and France in April and May as well as the resumption of the World Seven Series tournaments.
