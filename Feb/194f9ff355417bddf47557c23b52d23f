Top five Kenyans players in the ongoing 2020/2021 Safari Tour Pro Golf Series are assured of slots in the European Tour Magical Kenya Open slated for Karen Country Club next month. Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) general manager, Vincent Wang’ombe, confirmed top five locals in the ‘Road to Magical Kenya Open 2021’ and Zimbabwean Robinson Chinhoi have attained unassailable points. “It is impossible to dislodge the top five Kenyans and Chinhoi who are assured of slots,” said Wangombe. The top five Kenyan pros are Tour leader  Greg Snow  (296.6 points), Dismas Indiza  (275.9 points), David Wakhu  (245.7 points), Simon Ngige   (240.9 points) and Ooko Erick Obura (211.0 points). Zimbabwean Chinhoi, who has been camping in Nairobi since the Tour started last October, is lying third on 260.6 points. The 2020/21 Safari Tour, the only pro golf tour in East Africa, teed  off at Limuru Country Club in October 2020, where Greg Snow emerged the winner. On the second week of October, Chinhoi staged a stunning penultimate day fight-back to emerge the victor at Royal. Following cancellation of the 2020 Magical Kenya Open organizers KOGL started a new season with qualifying scores. Chinhoi also won Uganda Open and the recent Nyali round. Chinhoi shook off stiff competition to beat Kenya’s Dismas Indiza by a solitary shot tat the just concluded seventh leg of the 2021 Safari Tour Pro Golf Series at the par 71 Nyali. Home player Justus Madoya was peerless at Great Rift Valley Lodge.   Total Points 1. Greg Snow  264.1 2. Dismas Indiza  243.3 3. Robson Chinhoi  225.6 4. David Wakhu  217.7 5. Simon Ngige  210.8 6.
