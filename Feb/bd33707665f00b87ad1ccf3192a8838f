Remember the tout who left a Nairobi court in stitches last month when he said smoked bhang to "understand BBI"? And said smoking bhang makes him feel he's on a journey to Canaan? Well, it was good news on Wednesday for Wycliffe Orinda, 31, who was charged with creating a disturbance by visiting his wife's workplace and causing chaos. He made the BBI declaration in court on January 9. He was sentenced by Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku to three years probation. The sentence means he will report to his area chief to run errands for three years. Orinda now says he's a preacher and told the court he will spread peace and love if released. ODM chief Raila Odinga has said the BBI report is the bridge to taking the country to Canaan. The probation report filed in court said Orinda is married to Caroline Wambui, age 43. It said Orinda has a history of causing disturbances and has been warned several times. Orinda said using bhang and drinking alcohol make him feel he is on a journey to Canaan. The BBI report was commissioned after the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila. Orinda committed the offence at Revlon Plaza in Nairobi at his wife's place of work. They are estranged but he went to see her because he wanted to see his children. He also said he drinks alcohol, which makes him find older women attractive. "I admitÂ  I created a disturbance at Caroline Wambui's place of work and if it was not for drinking alcohol, I could not have met my wife who is older , Orinda told the court. Orinda said he only wants to see his children when he goes to her workplace. He told magistrate Mutuku he was living with Caroline and the children in Eastleigh but was arrested and taken to Industrial Area after he lost his job. (Edited by V. Graham)
