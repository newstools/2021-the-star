Kenyans celebrated the sentencing of Stephen Ngila, the man who chopped off his wife’s hands in 2016. This story can be a basis for a sincere discussion on family life issues and challenges. There are many spouses living in abusive relationships but are unable to speak out. Men have been the main culprits in cases of domestic violence, but a keen observation indicates that even women are guilty. Just like women, some married men are suffering in silence. A solution can be found. There’s premarital counselling, for instance, which should be encouraged. If done by a qualified therapist, counselling helps a great deal. Couples will be able to understand each other’s likes and dislikes, history, values and beliefs, fears and expectations. Betrothed couples can engage a professional counsellor, a mature honest person, an honest married church official or clergy. Religious organisations can organise free family life seminars for married couples. There could be many families in need of counselling but who fail to attend because of the high registration fees. The media can also play a role. In addition to sharing information on effective marriages, they can encourage feedback from the audience. This way people will learn that marriage is about understanding and supporting one another. Complementing one another, appreciation and forgiveness add value to marriage. I would encourage victims to identify a trusted person to share with what they are going through. Take it to the Lord in prayer. Report the abuse. Courts should fast track hearing and ruling.
