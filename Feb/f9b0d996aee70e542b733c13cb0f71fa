Schools are slated to begin closing for the second term holiday in under three weeks to give room for the KCPE, KCSE exams. According to the Education ministry calendar, learners in Pre Primary 1 and 2; Grade 1, 2 and 3; Class 5, 6 and 7; and Form 1, 2 and 3 learners will proceed for a seven-week holiday. They will reopen on May 10 for the third term of 2020 that was lost following the 10-month closure of the pandemic. However, this will not be the case for Grade 4 learners whose stay at home will run for three months. The latter happens to have a long holiday as they await the commencement of the 2021 school calendar in July as they transit to Grade 5 in July. This is because Grade4 learners opened earlier—in October—together with candidates in Class 8 and Form 4. KCPE exams will commence on March 22 and end on March 24 and will see some 1,187,517 registered candidates write the test. KCSE candidates will have their rehearsals on March 25 before sitting the exam from March 26 to April 21 and will be administered to 751,150 candidates. Upon completion of KCPE, KCSE examinations, Grade 4, and incoming Form 1 (Class 8 graduates) learners will stay at home as other learners complete their Term three. Pre Primary 1 and 2; Grade 1, 2 and 3; Class 5, 6and7; and Form 1, 2 and 3 learners will be heading for third term; these classes started their Term 2 on January 4. They will proceed for the third term upon reopening on May 10 and will run all the way to July 16 and preceded by a 10-day holiday before learners resume for their next academic year. The learners will also have a mid-term break between June 3 and 7. The holiday runs between July 17 and July 25; all learners will then proceed to the next class upon reopening. During the 10-day break, teachers handling the new curriculum in Grade 5 will be trained on the same by the Teachers Service Commission. Admission to Form 1 is also expected to take place soon after the July reopening. The calendar is an adjustment of the traditional January- December school cycle that was altered by the closure of all learning institutions in March last year. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
