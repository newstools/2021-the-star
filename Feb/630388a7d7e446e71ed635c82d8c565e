Fourteen people have been arrested after being found weeding bhang worth Sh27m in Naivasha. TheÂ 14 were found weeding in the one-acre farm at Kedong Ranch by a multi-agency team comprising of Anti Narcotics detectives, AP Officers attached at Kedong field training Camp and the OCPD Naivasha. Their arrest followed a tip-off from members of the public, who gave information about the farm. Last year, a United Nations commission voted to remove cannabis from a list that categorized it as one of the most dangerous drugs. Cannabis had been categorised alongside heroin and other opioids for being highly addictive and highly liable for abuse. They were also labelled as being particularly harmful and of extremely limited medical or therapeutic value." The commission recognized that the plant is having medicinal value after the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs approved a recommendation from the World Health Organization. There are at least two active chemicals in marijuana that researchers think have medicinal applications.
