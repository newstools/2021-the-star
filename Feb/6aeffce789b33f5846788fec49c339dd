Everton have signed striker Joshua King from Championship (second-tier) side Bournemouth until the end of the 2020-21 campaign, the Premier League club said in a statement. Everton said they had paid a “nominal fee” for the Norway international, who has scored 53 goals in 184 matches for the south coast side. The 29-year-old brings plenty of Premier League experience to Everton having scored 48 goals in 161 games for Bournemouth in the English top flight. With the transfer deadline at 2300 GMT on Monday, Everton were in the market for an attacker after Cenk Tosun rejoined his former club Besiktas on loan until the end of the season. Everton, eighth on 33 points, travel to Leeds United in the league on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Southampton have signed Japan international Takumi Minamino from Premier League champions Liverpool on a loan deal until the end of the season, the south coast club said. The attacking midfielder joined Liverpool in January last year from Austria’s Red Bull Salzburg for a fee of around 7.25 million pounds ($9.93 million). He made 31 appearances in all competitions for the Merseyside club, scoring four goals. Southampton coach Ralph Hasenhuettl said the 26-year-old, who has played 26 times for Japan, would offer a good attacking option in the second half of the campaign. Southampton also confirmed striker Shane Long had sealed a loan switch to Championship side Bournemouth for the remainder of the season. Defender Yan Valery will also play in the English second tier for the rest of the campaign after completing a loan move to Birmingham City.
