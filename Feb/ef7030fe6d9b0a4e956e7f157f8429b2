Kenya will bid to host the Confederation of African Tennis Under -14 tournament in April. Making the announcement yesterday, Tennis Kenya administrator Nancy Nduku said the federation had sent its bid documents and expressed confidence that the country will be given the rights to host the event. "We have hosted the event before and with our strict Covid -19 regulations and protocols. This gives a good case to host the event," said Nduku. The tournament is expected to bring players from North, West and South African countries for a one-week extravaganza at Nairobi Club. The country successfully hosted the ITF World Tennis Tour for the past three weeks and Nduku was satisfied with the performance of Kenyan players at the event as well as tournament organisation in the middle of a pandemic. "Our players were quite competitive and it bodes well for the upcoming tournaments. In terms of planning, we have ensured that all health protocols are observed,” added Nduku. "Kenya will be represented by the likes of Derrick Ominde, Kael Shah, Rosehilda Asumwa among others for the event which will bring the best players on the continent.” Elsewhere, Kenya's top-ranked junior Angela Okutoyi departs the country this week for the ITF Training Centre in Casablanca, Morocco. Okutoyi, who won two of the three tournaments during the just concluded ITF World Tennis Tour at Nairobi Club will be in the North African country for the next two years as she interacts with the some of the continent's best coaches and players.
