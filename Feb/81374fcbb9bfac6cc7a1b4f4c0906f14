Mandera Governor Ali Roba on Thursday urged the national government, development partners and NGOs to increase their support for orphaned children. He said orphans suffer, particularly in Mandera—a vast county with harsh climatic conditions. “We are well alive to the fact that life has not been easy for orphaned families. It is for this reason that we must go out of our way and see what we can do for these families," he said. Roba spoke at the county headquarters when he launched the 2020-21 Mandera County Orphanage Grant. He presented a Sh13 million cheque, an amount that will go towards supporting orphanages. The funds benefit Mandera Islamic Centre, Dawa Integrated Orphanage Centre, Madrasatul Ubay Bin Kaab, Al-Sunnah Orphanage Centre and Al-Hidaya Orphanage Centre. Roba said in the next financial year, his administration will scale up the grant for orphanages to Sh18 million to enable them to admit more children. In the current financial year, his administration will spend Sh113 million to employ 1,350 vulnerable women for the greening programme. Each will be earning Sh7,000 a month. “We also have 170 vulnerable women undertaking the sanitation programme getting the same amount every month. We provide food support amounting to Sh15 million to orphanages." "Additionally, we have construction of toilets for the most vulnerable in Neboi ward amounting to about Sh10 million and a housing programme.” Roba said they have also built a disability centre for Sh26 million, with Sh2 million extra for equipping it.
