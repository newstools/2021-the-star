Tanzanian singer Harmonize has introduced a new girlfriend to the public months after his Italian wife Sarah Michelotti left him. Harmonize took to social media to share photos of his new girlfriend Frida Kajala, who is a renowned Bongo movie actress. He captioned it, "Welcome to the United States of Kondegang Kondebeden and Fridakamala. Loyalty, promise to be there for you." Kajala is also the baby mama of legendary Tanzanian producer P Funk Majani. Together, they have a daughter who just completed her O-level studies. Harmonize' Italian girlfriend left him after he "disrespected" her with his ties to another woman. "I loved you for the person I thought you were, I gave you all the happiness which you failed to reciprocate," she wrote. "You’ve revealed to me you are a man with no respect, a liar, someone who doesn’t know how to keep a wife like me." This came days after Harmonize publicly declared he had sired a child with another woman. He first apologised to his loved ones, his wife, but most especially his daughter, Zulekha, whom he said he felt compelled to conceal from the rest of the world for fear of being scolded. Harmonize is currently holidaying in Zanzibar with his new catch, Kajala.
