Cash-strapped county governments are set to receive part of their share of revenue from the national government this week, the National Treasury announced on Tuesday. Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani said the ministry was “well on course to service ministries as well as county governments and institutions that rely on exchequer release.” The CS urged for patience saying the transfer to counties isn’t a small sum – about Sh25 billion per month, which has to be realised amid other competing needs. “Every month, the disbursement is about Sh25 billion. We have to manage based on other competing needs including salaries, pensions, and payments for constitutional offices.” Yatani restated his message to counties to consider spending what they already have saying Treasury has mandate to enforce good financial management. He said counties must ensure the money given to them is spent and returns filed in good time. “Devolution was not meant to keep money in accounts. We are not stopping disbursement but we encourage them to spend the money and implement projects in time.” “Stalled projects can be a big problem since the cost overrun can be beyond what was projected. It is part of the responsibility of treasury to enforce good financial practices.”
