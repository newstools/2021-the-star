The sleuths based in Kondele, Kisumu have confiscated over 500 liters of suspected chang'aa, 240 bottles of Simba Waragi, and several items. The operation was initiated following public outcry over increased consumption of the "kill me quick" liquor, with the perpetrators sneaking the same into social joints. Acting on a tip-off from members of the public, a team of the detectives led by the deputy In-Charge DCI post cornered a suspicious Toyota Fielder at a garage, recovering fifteen 20L jerricans of suspected chang'aa from it. Detectives said upon interrogation of the lone driver, they proceeded to a store within Riat area, therefrom making the rest of the recoveries. Trailing of more suspects is underway, with detectives working with the local leaders to neutralise the syndicate. The sleuths have been pursuing a criminal cartel notorious for distributing the second-generation alcohol and illicit liquor in the area.
