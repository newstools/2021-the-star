The High Court has cleared the way for Kenya Copyright Board to act on the forensic audit conducted on three Collective Management Organisations last year, after dismissing a petition filed by a member of one of the CMOs. Justice DK Kemei, sitting in Machakos, ruled that the audit was carried out in accordance with the Constitution and the Copyright Act. “I am satisfied that the forensic audit complained of did not violate the petitioner’s rights,” Kemei ruled. The judge ruled that Kecobo is entitled to call for audits of CMOs to satisfy itself that they are acting within the law and in the best interest of members. Kecobo last year reviewed the final report of the three-year forensic audit on the operations of MCSK, Prisk and Kamp and decided to submit the audit reports to law enforcement agencies to investigate suspected fraudulent transactions in the CMOs.
