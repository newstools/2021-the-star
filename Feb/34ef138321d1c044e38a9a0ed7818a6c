New World Trade Organisation (WTO) secretary general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has expressed her happiness following the confirmation that she will be the organizationâ€™s leader. The Nigerian was named confirmed on Monday, days after her main challenger from South Korea Yoo Myung-hee announced her withdrawal from the race. The 66-year-old becomes the first woman and the first African to occupy the position. Through her Twitter account, the secretary general thanked the WTO members for finalising her election. She replaces the former Roberto Azevedo (Brazilian) who stepped down from the leadership in August 2020, a year before the end of his term. Azevedo was serving his second term in office. He was appointed for the first term in September 2013 and re-elected for a second term of four years in 2017. Ngozi Okonjo is now responsible for supervising and directing the organisation's administrative operations. African Union Commission (AUC) chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat congratulated Ngozi Okonjo after the confirmation. Faki said that AU is pleased that the global consensus in favour of her inspiring leadership prevailed.
