Learners in private schools performed better than their public schools' counterparts in the pioneer class of the new curriculum, results of a national assessment conducted in October shows. This is even as a general drop was witnessed compared to the performance posted one year ago when they were in Grade 3. A similar assessment had been conducted in 2019 and KNEC argues that given the assessment was administered to the same cohort of learners, it was expected that performance at all levels would be similar or more comparable. The sharp decline saw a deep in the number learners performing below expectation from 8.99 per cent in the Grade 3 assessment to 24.41 per cent in the current study. The national assessment tested 1.07 million learners in Grade 4 for Mathematics, English, Kiswahili and Science subjects. Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakango has warned the National Treasury against accumulating county funds, saying it risks piling-up to an unmanageable level. The exchequer releases to the devolved units shall have fallen behind by at least three months, a situation Governors say has disrupted county operations. Treasury CS Ukur Yatani has attributed the delays to the Covid 19 pandemic and the subsequent containment measures which he said had slowed down the pace of the economic activities, leading to low collections. According to the status of exchequer releases seen by the Star, the Treasury has so far released Sh212.62 billion against the total allocation of Sh373.59 billion allocated to them in the current financial year. This represents 43.09 per cent disbursement leaving a balance Sh212.62 billion or 56.91 per cent with five months to the end of the financial year. Kenya recorded 41,416 new HIV infections in 2019 alone, with 6,806 of the new infections being among children. The latest report by the Health ministry, however, shows this was a decline from 75,000 in 2010 among adults and a decline from 18,000 in 2010 among children. This, health experts say, amounts to a 44 per cent reduction of cases, which is indicative of substantial progress, but short of the reduction by 75 per cent envisioned by 2020. From the report, at least two million Kenyans have succumbed to the disease since the first case was officially reported in the country in 1984. However, the deaths declined rapidly from 51,000 in 2010 to 20,997 in 2019, representing a 59 per cent reduction, with the reduction being more significant among children, reducing from 16,000 in 2010 to 4,300 in 2019. Benedetta Nangila, 27, started fodder farming in 2018, not by choice but for lack of school fees. She even worked as a house help earning Sh5,000 a month, but that was not enough to meet her school fee needs. Nangila started growing bracaria grass on a 23 by 63 feet section of her father’s farm and harvests three times in a season and the yields can range from 120 to 300 bails. A bail of the bracalia grass sells for between Sh200 and Sh450. Michael Otieno from Mambo Leo in Kajulu village, Kisumu, is also an agri-entrepreneur making sandals from fish skins. Today, Nangila and Otieno are among youths in Western and Nyanza are thriving on agribusiness and creating employment. The killings in Kapedo where six people were brutally murdered last month were conducted by police officers and not bandits, a rights lobby group has claimed. The Independent Medico-Lego Unit has said the killings had clear marks of intentional execution. It says the evidence it has gathered from the ground show that the six were collected at the local market by the people “who seem to have had authority over them.” The six, including an IEBC official, were hauled into a waiting pick-up truck and driven away from the Chemolingot area and were later found in Shirata Area in Arabal on January 20. The lobby has agents in the ground and took part in the autopsy exercise that examined the bodies. According to its reports availed to the Star, the lobby says all the six bodies had at least one contact gunshot wounds..
