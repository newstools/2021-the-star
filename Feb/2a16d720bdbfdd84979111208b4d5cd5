Actress Njeri Gachomba, better known as Njambi, has denied claims she has separated with her baby daddy. This is after she publicly accused her husband of cheating on her. In various posts on Instagram, she claimed she had received lots of ‘evidence’ from an anonymous lady incriminating her baby daddy. The anonymous lady claimed to have proof she had been going out with Njambi’s man. But, speaking to Word Is, Njambi said the drama made them stronger. "You know how people see you are happy and they make it their job just to see that you're not doing well, that is what happened to us," she said. "I overreacted before knowing what exactly was going on. But we're good. Honestly speaking, I should be expecting such things more often. Funny thing, all this drama made us closer and stronger."
