The body of Simon Nyachae has arrived at his home in Nyosia, Kisii county ahead of the burial ceremony. Police chopper carrying his body landed at Kisii School on Sunday morning. The body was received by family members led by widow Grace, sons Michael, Ken and Lee. Leaders who were present included; Governor James Ongwae, Woman Rep Janet Ongera, Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong'i among other officials. Nyachae's burial ceremony will be held at Gusii Stadium. President Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM leader Raila will be present. Trained in the British colonial culture of strict discipline, obedience to leadership and commitment to work, Nyachae knew no other way. Mourners – politicians, government officials and family members – eulogised him on Thursday as a natural leader who valued results-oriented leadership and who administered discipline without hesitation. He brought the strictness home, and everyone, including his wives, submitted lovingly. At the same time, his heart was overflowing with compassion and generosity. As for strictness, after retiring from civil service service in the 80s his wife Grace Wamuyu was still employed. But he ordered her to resign in 1984 to be in charge of his new business, Sansora Limited, which he had set up in Kisii. "I knew it was not a request. It was an order," Wamuyu told mourners during a service to honour the politician in Nairobi. Nyachae served as DO and DC before becoming PC in Central province. He later served chief secretary and as Cabinet minister in various dockets.
