Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu has appointed a three-judge Bench to hear petitions filed against Nairobi Deputy Governor Ann Kananu Mwenda. The bench will be led by Justice Said Chitembwe. Other judges appointed to the bench are Weldon Korir and Wilfrida Okwany. The cases will be mentioned on February 25 at noon before the said bench. In January this year, Justice Antony Mrima consolidated all 10 cases challenging the vetting, appointment, swearing-in and assumption of office of Ann Kananu as Governor of Nairobi County. Mrima consolidated all cases saying it will save judicial time and accord each party an opportunity to be heard. “In order to foster an orderly conduct of all these related matters and given the limited judicial time coupled with the need to accord each party an opportunity to be heard, I am of the position that all these matters be consolidated,” said the judge. Among the 10 petitions, are those filed by Okiya Omtatah, the Law Society of Kenya, Thirdway Alliance, Anne Kananu herself among others. It is in the LSK matter that an order was issued stopping the swearing-in of Kananu as the substantive Nairobi Governor. It was Mrima who directed that the matter be heard by a bench to be constituted by acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu.
