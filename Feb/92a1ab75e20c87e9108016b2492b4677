The Kirinyaga woman accused of strangling her five-year-old sick son to death while allegedly casting out demons from him has failed to take a murder plea once again. Miriam Wambui was presented before a Baricho law court, but the DCI said it had not completed investigations within the seven days it had been given. The time lapsed on Tuesday and the lead investigator requested more days. Wambui was to undergo mental examination, her statement and fingerprints taken and a postmortem exercise conducted on her son's body. "We have done everything else apart from getting the doctor’s recommendations on the psychiatric state of the accused. We plead with the court to give us seven more days to finish up the task,” lead investigator Boaz Serem said. However, the court, through senior principal magistrate Monica Kivuti, declined the request and instead allocated it five more days and ordered that the report be submitted before court on February 10. Wambui, an Akorino sect believer, is accused of killing her son on January 21 in her Mukui village home in Ndia while exorcising demons. The court ordered that she be locked up at the Sagana police station awaiting mention on  February 10 when she is expected to take a plea.
