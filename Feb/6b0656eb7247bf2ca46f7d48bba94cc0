A Kerugoya court has asked the government to assign a lawyer to a Kirinyaga woman accused of killing her five-year-old son while allegedly casting out demons from him. Chief magistrate Alex Ithuku allowed the prosecution's request to defer plea-taking until Miriam Wambui is given a defence advocate. She failed to take a plea for the third time. “The pre-trial date will be February 16 when the court will also provide her with an advocate,” the magistrate said. The court heard that Wambui is fit to stand trial. A psychiatric report presented before the court by lead investigator Boaz Serem showed she understands the gravity of the charges and the consequences. The report was submitted under the directive of a Baricho court which had given the detective five days to deliver it, as opposed to the seven he had requested. Last week, Serem told the court that everything else his team was investigating and recording from the accused was ready apart from the mental assessment recommendation. Wambui, 36, allegedly killed her ailing son as she conducted a spiritual ritual at Kinyakiiru village in Ndia constituency.
