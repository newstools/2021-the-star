The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal has suspended the decision by Jubilee Party to expel six senators. Chairperson Desma Nungo has further restrained the Registrar of Political Parties from removing the name of the senators from the membership of Jubilee Party pending hearing and determination of the case . Senator Issac Mwaura filed his complaint separately and got his own orders on the matter. Senators Millicent Omanga, Naomi Waqo, Mary Yiane, Prengei Victor and Falhada Dekow filed their complaint jointly and also secured the same orders. "Pending hearing and determination of this application inter-parties this tribunal hereby stays any further implementation of Jubilee Party decision dated February 8 to expel the applicants from the party" the order reads The cases will be mentioned on February 16 and 17. Jubilee secretary-general Raphael Tuju had announced the expulsions on Monday, hours after Deputy President William Ruto met more than 100 Tanagatanga MPs at his Karen residence. He said each of the expelled members had a right to appeal the decision. The decision was the culmination of a protracted war against party members who have been accused of undermining the President. Mwaura appeared before the Muchai Lumatete-led Jubilee Disciplinary Committee to answer to charges of disloyalty to the party and advancing the interests of rivals on February 4. The party said he would get a verdict in a fortnight but the decision has come early. On Tuesday, Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata was removed as the Senate Majority Chief Whip. Kang'ata was replaced by Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi. Tuju said that while Kang'ata was within his rights to express his opinion to the President, the party had an issue with the manner in which he did it. He added that Kang'ata was later invited to a meeting and asked to apologise but he declined.
