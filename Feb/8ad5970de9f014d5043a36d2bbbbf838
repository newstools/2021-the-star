 A Makadara court magistrate on Friday dismissed a police application to detain a suspect believed to have gotten Sh60,000 out of Sh4 million obtained by menaces from a businessman. Principal magistrate Eunice Suter trashed the application by Corporal Benson Munyoki of Buruburu DCI offices to be granted orders to detain Habil Olembo. Munyoki had sought to hold Olembo for three days to investigate offences of demanding money by menaces and conspiracy to commit an offence—namely murder. The detective had told the court in an affidavit that the complainant  Daniel Odhiambo, paid Sh4 million to detective Lydia Chesebe, a DCI officer attached to Revenue Protection Services at the KRA offices. He wanted time to record witness statements. “In the submission, the only reason why the suspect is to be detained is for witness statements from undisclosed people to be recorded. The applicant (Cpl. Munyoki) is acting on hope of getting witnesses that are unidentified and mysterious to the court and the applicant,” Suter said. “Allowing the application will further the injustice to the respondent (Olembo). Going through the affidavit, a police officer is said to have taken Sh4 million. She is not arrested and no reason is explained. The suspect is said to have taken Sh60,000 only and no link is disclosed by the officer for the charge before court. I find that the application lacks merit and is not allowed,” the magistrate ruled.
