Deputy President William Ruto has said he is the only one fit to take over when president Uhuru Kenyatta retires. Ruto on Friday said he deserves the presidency since he is in a better place to continue the development legacy that Uhuru will leave. Speaking in Kiambaa during the fundraising for Boda boda, Ruto said he stood with Uhuru during a critical time when he needed a friend. “Those who are now ridding on 2022 endorsements, where were they in 2012?When we needed them they turned their backs on us and said we have a case at the ICC. Now they come from nowhere to seek endorsements,” he said. Ruto further dismissed the claim that the hustler movement is creating political class wars of hustlers vs dynasties. He said the biggest problem Kenya is facing is not tribalism, but poor plans that cannot boost the living standards of ordinary people. “I once helped Raila until he became the Prime Minister. I helped Uhuru until he became the president, what is wrong with me helping the ordinary mwananchi?,” Ruto posed. He said it is unfortunate that those on the opposing side who have nothing to show are the ones coming up with theories that do not exist. “After this referendum, we should then embark on our development agenda. Let us not allow ourselves to be bought cheaply and be used to create divisions and tribalism,” he said. Ruto’s sentiments come hours after Uhuru hit at him for double standards. Uhuru while in Uthiru gave Ruto an ultimatum to choose which side of government he was in. After launching a health clinic in Uthiru, Uhuru said there was no way his deputy would conveniently criticise his administration and at the same time take credit for Jubilee's successes. The President said he wouldn’t want to engage in unnecessary political fights calling out the DP’s side for engaging in double-speak.
