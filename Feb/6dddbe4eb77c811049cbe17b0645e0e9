Tanzania's President John Magufuli is a well-educated man with no less than a doctorate in Chemistry. He has helped lift the country's economy and just the other day, it was awarded lower-middle-income status by the World Bank on account of its strong economic performance. But lately, his actions raise questions if indeed his solid academic credentials are of use in the fight against Covid-19. The world over, leaders have acknowledged the existence of the coronavirus and put in place measures to control its spread. However, the 'Bulldozer' is in denial, putting thousands of Tanzanians at risk. While the virus has claimed the lives of Zanzibar's First Vice President Seif Sharif Hamad and Tanzania's Chief Secretary John Kijazi, Magufuli still believes it is pneumonia. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention in its latest advisory said the country's level of Covid-19 infection is "very high",Â  cautioning against any travel to Tanzania. Magufuli's continued denial of the existence of Covid-19 and solely resorting to prayers does not portend well for neighbouring countries, which have done everything possible to tackle the pandemic. East Africa is well connected in terms of trade and communities that straddle more than one country. Failure by one to tackle a pandemic negates the efforts of others. Therefore, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda must put in place strict border control measures to check Magufuli's obstinacy.
