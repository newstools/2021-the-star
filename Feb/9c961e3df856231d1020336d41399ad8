The man is said to have collapsed while doing pushups before being rushed to Bokoli Subcounty Hospital where he was pronounced dead. The recruit Dennis Mukhebi, who hailed from Bokoli area, is said to have gone through all the initial recruitment stages  but collapsed while doing push ups. Dennid Ngetich, the deputy regional police commander  who was overseeing the exercise, said, “The doctors tried their best to assist him but sadly we lost him."
