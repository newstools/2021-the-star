Homa Bay Woman Rep Gladys Wanga now says all politicians opposing the BBI referendum should be sent packing in the 2022 General Election. Wanga on Tuesday said it would not be fair for such politicians to be allowed to implement the BBI if it sails through. The legislator said the reason the 2010 Constitution has struggled over the years is because it landed in the hands of those who opposed it. "It has been a challenge to implement because both President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto were in the opposition camp. How could they implement something they opposed?" Wanga posed. Speaking on Citizen TV, Wanga argued that anybody seeking any elective seat should support the BBI process that seeks to unite the country. "Let us be honest to ourselves, the BBI is seeking to unite this country, those who are opposing it yet they want to be leaders in various capacities. Do they want to lead a divided country?" she posed. Her sentiments were echoed by the National Gender and Equality Commission-NGEC commissioner Priscilla Nyokabi who said all the three political bigwigs must put their focus on the BBI. "What is happening right now we all know it is the practice of politics but it is getting us worried. We must separate the BBI from 2022 because the current heightened political tension is a replica of 2005 that later wreaked havoc in the country after the 2007 election," she said. Nyokabi said Uhuru, Ruto and Raila must lead the country to a moment of calmness and articulate issues around the BBI. "We should be focusing on the politics of equity and capacity building, it should not be about empty politics but value-based. I want to share the sentiments that personally I am not also ready to vote anybody who is opposing the BBI," she said. Nyokabi argued that the BBI has articulated issues of equality especially with regards to the two-thirds rule and thus it is the only document that can sort out the impasse.
