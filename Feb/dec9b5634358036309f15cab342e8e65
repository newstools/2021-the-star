Marsabit county officials on Sunday denied reports that one of its vehicles seized at Turbi was being used to ferry an AK47 rifle and ammunition to fan conflict. On Saturday, Border Patrol Unit officers impounded the vehicle, property of the Department of Water, during an operation in which they recovered the gun and 10 rounds of ammunition. During the operation, a Marsabit MCA fled from the scene, according to Eastern regional police boss Noah Mwiwanda. On Monday, Marsabit Deputy Governor Solomon Gubo and Water executive Adan Kaneno said the vehicle was on official duty to repair boreholes. Onboard were the driver and a water technician who were headed to Bori in Butiye ward, Badanrero in Obbu ward, Elle Borr in Uran ward and Kambi Nyooka of Turbi. Gubo said the police were yet to notify them of the reason for impounding the vehicle and the arrest of the county staffers. He said that the county government was not a party to conflicts and no county government employee is expected to advance conflicts or support parties to clashes. Speaking in Isiolo, the deputy governor said the boreholes being repaired are used by all communities in Marsabit county. The officials also took issue with a series of tweets from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation in which they shared photos of the vehicle and announced the arrests. They said the DCI should have taken time to investigate the incident. Kaneno called upon the DCI to investigate the matter with the thoroughness it deserves. He urged members the communities living in Marsabit to uphold peace and ignore divisive propaganda on social media and some mainstream media houses. They reiterated the county government administration’s commitment to peace, inter-ethnic harmony and cohesion.
