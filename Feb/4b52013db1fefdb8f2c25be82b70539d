Former powerful Cabinet minister Simeon Nyachae is dead. Nyachae passed away on Monday at Nairobi Hospital aged 88 years. "He has rested after a fairly long illness. We want to thank and appreciate Mzee's life and what he has been able to do," his son and former CIC chairman, Charles Nyachae, said. Addressing the media on Monday, Charles thanked the hospital for the care they gave his father. "I spoke to Uhuru and we appreciate that and his concern and all other friends who have stood by us," he said. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said this was a very sad day for all Kenyans. "This is a very sad day. Let us remain calm, focus and listen from the family as they plan. Let's continue to pray for the family," he said. He said that a more detailed announcement will be put out later by the family. Last month, there were rumours that the former minister had passed away but  Charles later dismissed the claims. Nyachae served under both regimes of the late President Daniel Moi and retired President Mwai Kibaki. He had also served as a provincial administrator in various parts of the country. Nyachae served as the Chief Secretary, Head of Civil Service and Secretary to the Cabinet between 1984 and 1987 when he retired from the civil service. During his tenure, he came up with the now-famous District Focus for Rural Development programmes to curb rural-urban migration. The long-term MP for Nyaribari Chache served as Minister for Agriculture and Industrialisation under Moi and later headed the Roads and Public Works docket under the Kibaki administration. Nyachae in 2002 ran for the presidency on a Ford-People ticket, emerging third after Narc's Mwai Kibaki and Kanu’s Uhuru Kenyatta. The former Ford People leader represented Nyaribari Chache for about 15 years before he lost to Dr Robert Monda in the 2007 General Election.
