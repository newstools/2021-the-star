Simon Ngige of Thika Sports Club missed a number of greens, but still managed to grab a one shot lead going into today’s final round of the 2021 Safari Tour seventh leg at the par 71 Nyali Golf and Country Club in Mombasa yesterday. Starting the day on two under par and just a shot behind round two leader David Wakhu, Ngige basically hit all the fairways though his approach shots were the biggest issue and denied him a lower score for the day. He was however happy with his narrow lead. “My approach shots let me down as I either went to the bunkers or overshot the greens. I will try and avoid it tomorrow,” said Ngige who is chasing his first Safari Tour title. “I don’t  think I missed any fairway today as I was hitting my wedge after a taking off well with my fore lease in most of the par fours. “On the other hand, missing birdies in all the longer holes (par fives) was also another reason why I couldn’t finish with a better score,” he added. Ngige sent his second shot to the bunker at the fourth, to drop his first  shot of the day, then overshot the green on the par four-ninth and later bogeyed the par three-10th. He, however, picked up birdies at the 12th and the par three 15th for one over par 72 and a three rounds total of one under par 212. This means he will be in the same flight with the Zimbabwean Robson Chinhoi and Golf Park’s David Wakhu in the final round where the winner will take home Sh150,000. Chinhoi played a clean first nine which included two birdies at the first and fourth. He dropped a shot at the 13th but made two successive birdies at the 15th and 16th though a bogey at the par five-17th denied him an under par finish. His level par for the day left him at level par 213 for the tournament and a chance to strike to the top in the closing round today. It was, however, a bad day for Round 2 leader Wakhu who blamed his take off from the tee and a few second shots. “Today I hit my four iron in the long and middle holes, but they were not perfect and made it difficult for me to hit the greens on regulation though I will still go with the same game plan tomorrow as I believe it is still possible to recover the six shots in the final round,” said Wakhu who bogeyed mostly the par fours.
