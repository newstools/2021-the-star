Twitter is considering adding subscriptions fees for some features as the company looks to diversify its revenue beyond ads. According to Hill media , Twitter is doing this to increase revenue durability. "You will see us continue to research and experiment with ways to further diversify our revenue beyond ads in 2021 and beyond,” Twitter’s revenue product lead Bruce Falck, said as reported by the Hill. The fees may include subscriptions and other approaches that will give people and businesses of all sizes on Twitter access to unique features. Bloomberg reported that Twitter was also considering additional revenue through charging for services like TweetDeck or other advanced features, such as 'undo send' or profile-customization options. TweetDeck offers a more convenient Twitter experience by letting you view multiple timelines in one easy interface. It includes a host of advanced features to help get the most of Twitter: Manage multiple Twitter accounts, schedule Tweets for posting in the future, build Tweet collections, and more. Subscriptions have always offered an alternative to advertising, but social networks have traditionally stayed free as a way to encourage user growth and engagement.
