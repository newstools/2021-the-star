Did Kennedy Kaburu, popularly known as DJ Star Boy, have a premonition about his death? The fast-rising deejay died in a road accident on Sunday. In one of his last posts that fans have termed premonition, the DJ wrote, “The cemetery is full of unfinished dreams.” Adding, “Pray for life and not just the money.” He was driving a Toyota Hilux on the Maua-Meru route, and he was in a jovial mood before the journey commenced. A video taken of his many errands transporting what is known as 'green gold' (miraa) has since gone viral. Friends and fans have shared their condolences with the family. In another recent post, he quoted former US President Theodore Roosevelt's famous 'Man in the Arena' speech: “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better," he wrote. "The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly. Who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” In his last post, the deejay shared a throwback photo of his friend, DJ G400, who later commented on the post that, "Damn bro, I didn't see this as a goodbye." His girlfriend, Claire Ashley wrote, "My love. I will surely miss you. I love you from the deepest part of my heart and I’ll always do. You made us all so happy. Sleep well, my love. Till we meet again." He was the secondborn child of the late Charles Murwithania and Nancy Kathure. The burial preparations have been going on in Nkubu. He will be buried today at Taai village, Kagwampungu.
