Coach Mike Malungu is confident of national Under-21 pulling good results during the Junior Africa Cup scheduled for Accra, Ghana next month. The tactician said they are currently working on the tactical aspect of the game and physical conditioning of players. He said for the players to compete effectively, there are certain facets of the game they need to get used to early ahead of the event scheduled for March 22-28. "Players have come off age and we are now at a crucial stage where we need to get our act together. We need to know when to break down the opponent; work on the  concentration aspect and avoid conceding early," said the Western Jaguars tactician. He added: "The difference between us winning or losing is how we set up. We are creating a team that can master the game and produce results. Penalty corners can become our strength if we can maximise on them,"Malungu observed. Malungu, who doubles up as the assistant coach for the senior national team, said they have selected a 25-man squad but expect it to be whittled down to 18 in the next fortnight. Malungu said arriving in Accra early will be an added advantage in as far as acclimatisation is concerned.
