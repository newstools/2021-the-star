Police are investigating claims by a Chinese national that he lost Sh50 million from his bedroom in Langata, Nairobi. Wang Daoli went to Langata police station on Friday and informed officers there he had lost the money which was in a safe. Four workers are in custody over the incident. Daoli had on February 11 gone to a party outside Phenom estate in Langata to celebrate China’s New Year when the incident happened. He told police that he left his house at about 6.30pm for the party and came back at 11pm when he found the safe containing the said money in both Kenyan and US dollars missing. Friday ushered in the Year of the Ox for the Chinese, changing over from the Year of the Rat (2020). Those years are named as per Chinese zodiac signs. Daoli is a businessman who imports assorted goods and sells them. He said that  he had left his driver and househelp in the house. Police who visited the scene said the bedroom was not broken into. The compound too was also not breached. The four workers - Househelp, driver, two security men - were detained for questioning. Police are reviewing cctv footage of the incident as part of the investigations into the theft. When asked why he kept such huge amount of money in his house, Daoli said the nature of his work dictates so. Nairobi police boss Rashid Yakub said they are investigating to establish how and why the incident happened with an aim of recovering the money. “We always encourage people the safest place to keep your money is in a bank. We are however following various leads into this,” he said.
