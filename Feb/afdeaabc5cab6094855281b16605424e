National 5,000m champion Michael Kibet and All Africa Games 5,000m champion Robert Kiprop are set to face-off at Saturday’s Athletics Kenya North Rift Cross Country Championships at the Kapenguria grounds in West Pokot County. Kibet, who won the 2019 Ndalat Gaa cross country title, has fully recovered from the disappointment he encountered in 2019 after missing to run for Kenya at the World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar. He has set his focus on the Africa Cross Country in Lome, Togo in May as well as the Olympic Games in Japan in July. Kibet won the national championships ahead of Daniel Simiu but both failed to make their maiden appearance in national colours when they failed to meet the anti-doping threshold set by Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU). In their position, third finisher Africa Cross Country junior champion Nicholas Kimeli and junior runner, Africa junior 5,000m silver medalist Jacob Krop did duty for Kenya in Doha. “My focus is to clinch the regional title as part of my preparations for the national and continental championships. I also want to bring home the elusive Olympic Games 5,000m title from Tokyo, Japan," said Kibet. "It was hurting to miss out on the World Championships but that is behind me now as I set my focus on upcoming championships." Kibet said he is ready to bring home the Olympic Games 5,000m title last won by a Kenyan in 1988 through retired John Ngugi. Kiprop’s coach Ian Kiprop, based at Brother Colm O’Connell training camp in Iten, said his athlete has done what it takes to be on the podium when that day comes. “He has been consistent and we hope he will cut the national team for Africa Cross Country Championships,” said Ian. He added that East Africa 1,500m champion Emmanuel Kemboi will also be in contention after graduating into the senior ranks. At the juniors, he will be depending on Hillary Cheruiyot, a Form Four student at Kimoron High School, a school that nurtured world 800m record holder David Rudisha.
