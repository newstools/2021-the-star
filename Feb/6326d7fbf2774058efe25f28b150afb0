ODM leader Raila Odinga has warned MPs against criminalizing the hustler versus dynasties narrative. In a statement on Wednesday, Raila appealed to the legislators to allow DP William Ruto to continue with his slogan without being stopped. "It is a dangerous slogan..it is scary in its similarity to Adolf Hitler's national socialism referred to as Nazism," he said. Nazism was an ideology of the Nazi party which ruled Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945. "However, I would strongly appeal to MPs to drop any attempts to legislate against this otherwise deadly slogan," Raila said. Raila said that Kenya fought for free speech and association. "We should be able to allow Ruto and his team to continue with their chosen slogan without any inhibitions," he said. "Those of us who see its dangers should continue educating our people against falling for it. I have Faith that Kenyans will see through the divisive and potentially deadly rhetoric and its attacks on Kenyans and reject it in the ends."  More to follow
