Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo has won a case filed by former CECs after the court ruled that he has the power to nominate people of his choice. In January, sacked CECs moved to court and obtained conservatory orders stopping Nyaribo from vetting nominees for the positions. But on Thursday, Justice Hellen Wasilwa ruled that the governor has the power to nominate people of his choice to hold such offices. The ruling allows the county assembly to proceed with the vetting process of the nominees and give way for the committee on appointment to give its verdict. The case that has been dragging on for the last one month has affected service delivery, hence derailing development. Residents have received the news with joy, with some saying the decision was long overdue. In her ruling, the judge barred the petitioners from accessing the offices. She said they should hand over with immediate effect. Two of the 10 nominees have already been vetted. They are Stephen Onwongâ€™a (Trade and industry) and Grace Nyamongo (Sports).
