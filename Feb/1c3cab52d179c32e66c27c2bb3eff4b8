Producer and DJ Kaneda Nicole is not impressed by the treatment of women in the music business. Speaking to Word Is on Tuesday, the Homeboyz Radio employee said, "Women always have to work 10 times harder and have to have the look rather than the knowledge in music. They have to bow down to the male gatekeepers just to have a chance on the decks." Adding, "It's sad that some women have to give themselves up just to get five minutes of fame in the industry." Kaneda holds a Master's from Berklee College of Music and a degree in audio and music technology. "I was the only female in my undergrad for a reason, the music industry is so brutal when it comes to women in music. Iâ€™m looking at the sound engineers, music producers and female DJs, the representation in the industry is 93 to seven."
