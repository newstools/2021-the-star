Arrow Bwoy has released a new single, 'Fashionista', off his upcoming album. He celebrates the African woman’s beauty and diverse fashion style through catchy lyrics laid on an upbeat track that's blended with classic guitar melodies. His yet-to-be announced album will be a follow-up to Hatua, his debut album released in 2019. Having collaborated with Jamaica’s Demarco and Cecile, Nigeria’s Mayorkun, Uganda’s Jackie Chandiru, and Voltage Music, as well as Kenya’s Wyre, Otile Brown among other top acts, Arrow Bwoy has his eyes set on flying the Kenyan flag to the global heights. Late last year, Arrow Bwoy unveiled a new music label, Utembe World, along with its first signee, Iyanii. Through the label, he hopes to extend the same support he got at the beginning of his career to the new generation of musicians.
