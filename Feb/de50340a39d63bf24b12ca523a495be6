Nandy has lost the footage of her highly anticipated music video 'Leo Leo' featuring Koffi Olomide. The Tanzanian singer flew the Lingala artiste to Tanzania to shoot the music video. Responding to a fan on why the video has not been released, Nandy said, "Material imefutika, acha tu (The footage has been erased)." The 'Kivuruge' hitmaker has shared the audio on YouTube. Nandy did not reveal whether she will redo the music video or not. At the same time, the singer is rumoured to have broken up with her fiance, rapper Billnass, after revealing she is currently single. The rapper later tweeted, "Love tortures a lot of people. If you get the chance to be single, don't play with it."
