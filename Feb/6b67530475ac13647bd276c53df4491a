Commonwealth Games 800m champion Wycliffe Kinyamal believes his rivalry on the track with Ferguson Rotich is good for the country’s prospects in 800m. Kinyamal said competition between them improves the medal haul prospects for the country in major competitions. “He is a Kenyan like me and so I think the rivalry between us is great. A win for any one of us is a win for the country. He is a great runner and I enjoy running against him,” Kinyamal said. He clocked 1:46.09 to finish second to the World Championships 800m bronze medalist in Heat 3 of the 800m race at Saturday’s third leg of Athletics Kenya Relay Series at Nyayo Stadium, Nairobi. The two were locked in a neck-to-neck battle in the last 100m before Rotich surged forward to cross the finish line first in 1:45.64. Abel Kipsang finished third in 1:46.36. Rotich described Kinyamal and all the other runners as worthy opponents who had stretched him to the limit. “At the start, I asked my coach why we had been put in the same heat. It was a tough lineup in which everyone had the chance to win,” Rotich said. Both runners are targeting a series of competitions to improve their personal bests. Rotich’s focus is on the upcoming World Relay Series and the Tokyo Olympics where he hopes to carry on the stellar form in which he has began the year. “I want to compete in both competitions and at least make it to the finals. If I can also compete in the 1000m, I will give it my all to improve on my personal best,” he said. Kinyamal said he will also participate in upcoming AK events as an opportunity to build up on his fitness and improve on his personal best. “The coronavirus pandemic hindered many of us from training well and that is why many are recording slow times. As for me, regardless, I want to be part of the team to Yokohama and I promise Kenyans that they will not be disappointed,” he said.
