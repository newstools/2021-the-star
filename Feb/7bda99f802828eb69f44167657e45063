Let Deputy President William Ruto's impeachment come to Parliament! These were the words of over 100 MPs allied to Ruto who held a presser at his Karen residence on Monday. The ANC party led by Musalia Mudavadi over the weekend threatened to sponsor a motion to impeach Ruto when parliament sittings resume. The party said Ruto is undermining President Uhuru Kenyatta and should either resign or face impeachment. But in a turn of events, the MPs led by Garissa Township MP Adan Duale dared those claiming to table the motion to be ready for a showdown, saying that they are not afraid. “Let them not discuss the impeachment of the Deputy President in bars, in funerals, and in their apartments. Let them bring it to the floor of the House starting tomorrow Tuesday when the House resumes,” Duale said. The National Assembly is scheduled to resume sittings for the Fifth Session on Tuesday, February 9, 2021, at 2.30pm with a bee-hive of activities awaiting them. Duale said that impeaching the DP is not a walk in the park. “We are telling all of them. The ODM, ANC, Wiper, the Kieleweke...please go and sit somewhere and bring the impeachment. We are ready for you," he said. Meru Senator Mithika Linturi said they will wait for the motion to be tabled. “Let them bring it on and I think when it finds its way on the floor of the House, then the MPs will deal with it at that time. As for now, I don’t think it is anything that worries us as a team,” Linturi said. More to follow
