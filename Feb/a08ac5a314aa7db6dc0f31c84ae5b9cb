Singer Juma Jux will headline the event that is set to thrill his Kenyan fans with songs from his 18-track 'The Love Album'. He will share the stage with R&B singer Otile Brown, who has been topping the charts with his 'Just in Love' album released mid-last year. In a statement, Jux said, "My songs are all about love and Valentine's being a very special day. I'm going to give all my heart out, especially to the Kenyan ladies. I want to make this Valentine's memorable." The line-up will also include singer Nikita Kering, Mugithi singer Samidoh and DJ Crème de la Crème.
