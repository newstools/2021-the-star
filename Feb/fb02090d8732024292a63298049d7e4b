Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho says Harry Kane will break “every possible record” after returning from injury to inspire Spurs to victory over West Brom. Kane returned ahead of schedule from ankle problems to help end Spurs’ three-game losing streak, with his 208th Tottenham goal drawing the England captain level alongside Bobby Smith and behind only Jimmy Greaves in Spurs’ all-time scoring list. Tottenham had failed to score in both matches Kane, 27, had missed but he took Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s through ball into his stride to slot home and break stubborn Albion’s rearguard resistance early in the second half. “Harry Kane is a special player in the history of the club,” Mourinho told BT Sport. “He is one of the best strikers in the world. The team depends a lot on him, we can’t hide that. It’s the goals he can score, the assists he can make, the link play he has, that personality that players like that can have and he is always an important influence for us.” Kane’s goal was his 13th in the Premier League this season, taking him ahead of strike partner Son Heung-min for all of four minutes until the South Korea striker sealed Spurs’ victory with an emphatic finish from Lucas Moura’s pass. Victory moved Spurs up two places to seventh, four points off the Champions League places, although that position and gap could change later on Sunday with Chelsea and Liverpool in action. West Brom remain 19th and 11 points behind 17th-placed Burnley despite an improved defensive display.
