Kenyans should keep wearing face masks, washing hands regularly and keeping social distance to avoid infection with coronavirus, Yatta MP Charles Kilonzo has urged. Kilonzo cautioned against violating the government’s directives on combating Covid-19, saying the pandemic is real. Addressing mourners during the funeral of his sister-in-law Mary Kioko, Kilonzo said Covid-19 was wiping out Kenyans of all social classes. “Covid-19 is real and the situation is getting out of control. It is too bad that even in the National Assembly, we are losing members, not for anything else but underlying issues. Covid-19 is sweeping us,” Kilonzo said. “Whatever you do, please take the necessary precautions since the disease is wiping Kenyans even in rural places. Even in our village, we always have funerals every week despite being a very small area. Whatever you do, always remember that Covid-19 is real. We hope we will be able to get a vaccine and solution soon.” Kioko was buried at her matrimonial home in Ndalani village in Yatta constituency, Machakos county on Saturday. Mary who worked with the Communications Authority for 20 years died on February 18. She last served the authority as stakeholder relations and corporate social responsibility officer at the Consumer and Public Affairs Department. Kilonzo said Kioko was a lovely, motherly, good-hearted, generous woman and a role model not only to her two daughters but everyone who interacted with her. “Mary was not only a mother to her two biological daughters, but to tens of other children including those of her late siblings who she lived with and treated as her own children,” Kilonzo said. Workmates, close friends, relatives, daughters, among other family members praised Kioko for being a loving, motherly, industrious person.
