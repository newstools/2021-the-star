 A legislator has asked youths to stop relying on politicians' handouts and office jobs, but to be creative and exploit opportunities offered by the government. Lari MP Jonah Mburu said so many young people do not have jobs despite being qualified. He urged youths to embrace technology, saying the government is offering training on how to work and earn money online. He said there are opportunities supported by the Ministry of ICT to boost trade and marketing online. The MP also urged them to make use of cash from Uwezo, Youth and Women Enterprise funds to start business ventures as they seek jobs. "You cannot keep waiting for politicians to give you money, you have to be creative and utilise the available resources," he said, urging youth not to indulge in drugs and alcohol. Mburu spoke at Kimende social hall on Wednesday where he had attended an information open day. More than 50 youths took courses on ICT under the Ajira Programme supported by the Ministry of ICT. He said the constituency has four ICT hubs which are located at Kimende, Kinale, Kamburu and Kagwe and has trained 200 youths. They are working online and assisting others to acquire knowledge. The founder of SHOPJIJI, and also programs manager for Young Kenyans Tech Lawrence Ngugi lauded the MP for  setting up the ICT hubs. He said out of 106 hubs in  the country, nine are in Kiambu county— four of them in Lari. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
