Bobi Wine, a contender in the 2021 Ugandan election, has withdrawn a case challenging the poll outcome. According to Al Jazeera, Wine said he made the decision because he felt the courts are not independent. Last month, a Ugandan court ordered security forces to cease surrounding Wine's home, after being under house arrest. Troops had blocked the 38-year-old pop star-turned-politician from leaving his house in a suburb of the capital Kampala since he voted in the January 14 election where he ran against long-serving incumbent President Yoweri Museveni. Museveni, 76, who has been in power since 1986, was declared the winner of the poll with 59 per cent of votes versus 35 per cent for Wine, who had for years denounced corruption and nepotism in his songs. He rejected the result, alleging fraud which the government denies.
