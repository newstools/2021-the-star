Micro, small and medium enterprises will access a discounted loan facility from KCB Bank to help address their cash flow challenges. This, according to the lender, will allow them acquire trading assets and working capital to support their business and preserve jobs through long-term resilience. “This facility will enable MSMEs to restart and rebuild as the pandemic-related restrictions continue to be lifted and recovery persists," said Annastacia Kimtai, Director Retail, KCB Bank. The beneficiaries will receive loans ranging between Sh100,000 to Sh5million  payable within 3 years. Businesses must  have been in existence for at least six months to access the facility. MSMEs who take up the facility terms will be trained on how to navigate through the prevailing market disruptions. “We recognise the potential MSMEs have on the economic growth in Kenya and that is why the bank takes a keen interest to support the sector,” Kimtai said. In October 2020, KCB also received approval for $150million, from the International Finance Corporation as a lead syndicator, to support the growth of the bank’s sustainable climate finance portfolio and scale-up lending to micro, small and medium enterprises including women-owned businesses. The credit line has been contributing to the economic growth of the Kenyan economy by helping develop green lending and creating employment, especially for women-owned businesses.
