The Pre-Trial Chamber of International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled on Friday that it has the jurisdiction to open an investigation against Israel for alleged crimes in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. “By majority, that the Court's territorial jurisdiction in the Situation in Palestine, a State party to the ICC Rome Statute, extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967,” ICC said in a statement. The Embassy of the State of Palestine in Kenya lauded the historic ruling and that the investigation that this decision has now facilitated sends a clear message to perpetrators of heinous crimes. It said that the decision conforms to the principles of international law and opens the door to the pursuit of criminal accountability for the most egregious crimes under the Court’s mandate, which have been and continue to be committed against the Palestinian people. “The Honorable Judges of the Pre-Trial Chamber have displayed respect to their mandate and independence, commitment to the values and principles of criminal accountability as embodied in the Rome Statute, and courage, impervious to unprecedented acts of outright hostility and intimidation,” Palestinian embassy in Kenya said. It added that over the past three years, the impartiality and independence of the Court have been tested with unparalleled enmity and punitive measures. “In this regard, the Embassy reaffirms its unwavering commitment to working with all States Parties to the Rome Statute on protecting and defending the integrity and independence of the Court from all attempts at exerting undue influence.” Said that the embassy stands ready to cooperate with and extend all assistance to the Prosecutor and the Court during the investigation into Israeli crimes, which should start in short order.
