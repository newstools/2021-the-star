Sigona Golf Club’s Mohit Mediratta beat the long-hitting Dismas Indiza by one hole in a three-hole play off, to claim the eighth leg of the 2020/21 Safari Tour Series at the par 71 Muthaiga Golf Club course. Mediratta said it was a huge relief after winning his first tournament in his three and half-years pro career, but very interesting also winning in a dramatic finish. The two players had tied on three under par 281 at the end of regulation play with Mediratta having shot level par 71 while Indiza, who had started the day ahead of Mediratta and Zambia’s Dayne Moore, posting one over par 72, to also wind up with 281. During the play off, which started at the par-three-13th, Mediratta spun the ball back to about four feet from the pin, for an easy birdie while Indiza, who was on the top right of the short rough, pitched closely though missed the birdie, to settle for a par. Whilst Mediratta played safe at the par-four-17th, Indiza drove to the water next to the green though he chipped well for a well-deserved par to share the hole with Mediratta, who also parred. It was at the par-five-18th where Indiza, who missed the green on two, chipped on but missed the birdie which would have squared the hole with Mediratta, who also missed his birdie for a par — all he needed to win the tournament. “I am extremely delighted winning my first tournament though my putter was very cold today,” said Mediratta. “I am looking for a back-to-back win at Karen next week which will definitely put me into the Magical Kenya Open next month.” He took home Sh100,000 plus Sh30,000 he won in the Pro-Am. Though he did not win at Muthaiga, Indiza said he was happy with his performance during the week. It was, however, the first nine where he appeared to have lost the tournament as he picked up four bogeys at the first, fifth, seventh at the ninth with only one birdie at the fourth. He, however, fired in an eagle at the 10th and birdied the last hole though with a bogey at the 12th hole. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe’s Robson Chinhoi fired under par 65 to move to finish third on two under par 282, just a shot better than Zambia’s Dayne Moore, who carded level par 71 for one under par 283. He made a total of six birdies against one bogey, to take the third cash prize of Sh80,000 and 45 points towards the “Road to Karen”. The action now shifts to Karen Country Club for the final leg of the series which will determine the top 12 Kenyans and the three visiting players for the Kenya Open.
