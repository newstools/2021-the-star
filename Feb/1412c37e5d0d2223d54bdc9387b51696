Karen MCA David Mberia has been barred from holding public office following his conviction for receiving a bribe of Sh1.7 million. Milimani chief magistrate Thomas Nzioki ruled that Mberia was not fit to hold or access his office as an MCA. "The accused is barred from holding a public office and accessing his office. This order is directed to be transferred to speaker county assembly for the record," the magistrate ruled. On Thursday, Mberia was sentenced to serve three years in jail or pay a fine of Sh700,000 for soliciting and receiving the bribe from a private school. The magistrate said the charge was proved through the testimony of the investigating officer. The court also noted that Mberia was found with treated money and dismissed his allegations of being framed. The court observed that he was a first offender and a leader. Through his lawyers, Mberia pleaded for lenient sentencing saying he was a family man and the sole breadwinner. The prosecution said being an MCA, he failed the integrity test by committing the offence. He is a state officer and he is mandated to observe integrity under the Constitution. The court, however, acquitted Mberia's co-accused MCAs Jared Okode (Mathare) and Abraham Mwangi (Woodley). The magistrate said the prosecution failed to provide enough evidence against Okode and Mwangi. According to the prosecution the offence was committed between April 8 and 25, 2019 within Nairobi county. The MCAs were to allegedly influence the outcome of an inquiry carried out by the Culture and Social Services Committee. The committee had probed the ownership of the land on which Kiragu Waichahi School is constructed. The court heard from EACC investigator Martin Ongara that the MCAs were arrested after pocketing a Sh200,000 treated bribe from the school's proprietor Edited by Henry Makori
