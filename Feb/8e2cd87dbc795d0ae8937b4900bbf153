The court has directed the former legal team representing ex-governor Mike Sonko in the Sh10 million Web Tribe bribery case to hand over all documentary evidence adduced to them by the state to the new legal team within 48 hours. Sonko appeared on Wednesday before Anti-corruption Magistrate Douglas Ogoti Ogoti after firing his team of advocates. He is now represented by Lawyer John Khaminwa, Assa Nyakundi and Wilfred Nyamu. His initial team was led by Cecil Miller and George Kithi. In the case before the court, Sonko was accused of demanding Sh10 million bribe from Web Tribe Ltd through ROG Security Limited as an inducement to facilitate payments by the county government. Web Tribe Ltd had been contracted by the Nairobi City County Government six years ago to collect revenue. The governor is said to have committed the offence between January 10 and 19, 2019 within the city. The matter has been proceeding with 10 protected witnessed having testified so far. The DPP had lined up 28 witnesses in the case. Sonko's new team is seeking all witness statements and documentary evidence the state will be relying on to prosecute the case. Sonko had also filed a separate application seeking the withdrawal of Ogoti from handling the case.
