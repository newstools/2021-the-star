Jubilee party disciplinary Committee has summoned nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura over alleged violation of party Constitution. In a charge sheet released on Monday, the party accused the senator of pledging allegiance to another political party contrary to Jubilee's code of conduct. "On December 31, 2020,in Msambweni Constituency, Senator Isaac Mwaura Maigua, acted contrary to the conduct expected of a Jubilee member when he publicly announced his new-found political allegiance to the United Democratic Alliance party during the homecoming party of the newly-elected Msambweni legislator Feisal Bader," the charge sheet read. The party also faulted Mwaura for wearing another party's branding material other than that of Jubilee. In a complaint lodged by Jubilee Chairman Nelson Dzuya, the party is seeking a disciplinary action against Mwaura for alleged procaiming that the party is 'dead' through Kenya Diaspora Media USA, his Twitter handle and during an interview on Citizen TV. The legislator is accused of acting and making public statements that have demonstrated disloyalty to the party. This is an about-turn from a previous statement of the party denying intensions to take disciplinary action on Mwaura. On January 5, Jubilee Party dismissed claims that the senator had been summoned by the party's disciplinary committee over similar charges. This was after a notice made rounds on social media claiming that the senator had been summoned to appear before the committee on January 18 over a number of complaints.
