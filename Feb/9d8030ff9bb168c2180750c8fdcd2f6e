Anglican Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit has called for urgent measures to end increasing school violence and arson. "The school fires caused by students are too alarming and the damages may completely disable learning in institutions if not addressed promptly and necessary action taken," Sapit said on Friday. He spoke at Mwaani ACK Church in Makueni county during a pastoral visit. The archbishop urged all stakeholders, including parents, teachers and clergy, to provide psychosocial supports to students to help restore order and discipline. "As the ACK Church, we mean well for all learners. That's why we are moving to different parts of the country to speak and encourage them to take great care of their schools for a better tomorrow," Sapit said. He urged parents to be closer to their children during vacations to instil good behaviour in them. The archbishop urged leaders to be good role models, saying public confrontations, especially among the political class, were sending the wrong message to learners.
