More than 63 women and youth groups in Kaloleni ward, Voi constituency have received Sh2.5 million in grants for their table banking activities. Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja said on Thursday the cash will boost the livelihoods of the women, youth and people with disabilities. The county chief called for responsible use of the grant for sustainable wealth creation. “My administration is committed to economically empowering existing women and youth groups. We are creating good grounds for self-employment,” Samboja said. He said the cash given would go a long way to promote financial inclusion as this targets those at the grassroots level. Samboja pointed out that all beneficiaries shall be monitored to ensure prudent use of the fund. Kaloleni MCA Ahmed Omar said the initiative would help cushion businesses and households from the disruptive effects of the coronavirus. “Many businesses are staggering as a result of the pandemic. This funding will help groups re-establish themselves,” Omar noted. He said the grant is a way to teach the youth how to fish, rather than giving them a catch of fish. Meanwhile, the governor's wife Stella Samboja said the administration has strived towards gender equity and inclusion. “Empowering a wide pool of people is a vital element of sustainable development. Involving women, youths and PWDs is important as these demographics are crucial pillars in the society,” she stated. The grant comes barely a week after the 2021 Youth Business Summit where over 500 youths were mentored by billionaire and Forbes-listed tycoon Narendra Raval Guru. The summit was meant to empower the youth with thriving entrepreneurial ideas.
