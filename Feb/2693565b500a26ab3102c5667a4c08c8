Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba will be sidelined for a few weeks due to a thigh injury he sustained during Saturday’s 3-3 draw with Everton, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said on Monday. The 27-year-old France international limped off in the first half at Old Trafford and was replaced by Fred. He missed Tuesday’s FA Cup fifth-round clash against West Ham United and will also sit out of Premier League games against West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United and Europa League ties against Real Sociedad. “It’s an injury that will take a few weeks to heal,” Solskjaer told MUTV. “He’s just started his recovery, working with the medical staff and we’ll get him back as soon and as safely as we can. “Paul has been very important for us and we’re not going to take any risks. A few weeks definitely. You never want to be injured and, especially, now Paul was really finding his form. We’ve been very healthy and strong for a long period so we can’t moan too much.” Meanwhile, Solskjaer said defender Eric Bailly, who has missed United’s last five games in all competitions due to injury, is closing in on a return.
