The government has warned communities living along the Kenya-Tanzania border in Lunga-Lunga to be vigilant and adhere to all Covid-19 health directives. The directive follows a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths in Tanzania.  The magnitude of the disease in the country is unknown because it has not kept official records. Kwale county commissioner Joseph Kanyiri said the government has heightened the border patrols and mass testing at the entry and exit points. He said the spike in Covid-19 cases in Tanzania poses a great threat to the communities who have intermarried and trade with each other. Kanyiri said efforts are in place to control movement along the borders. He asked residents to cooperate with authorities. “Kenya is doing what it takes to fight the pandemic but it would be great if the residents take their own initiative in combating the disease,” he said. Kanyiri said the move is to ensure safety of the community and prevent the spread of the virus. He said security officers have been deployed to man the illegal routes to neutralise visitors who will decide to get into the country illegally. The administrator urged both visitors and residents to use the legal routes and comply with the laid down travel and Covid-19 public health rules and regulations. “We have advised that anyone found trying to access Kenya through the unknown routes apart from the gazetted ones should be arrested and charged in court,” he said. Kanyiri said it is a legal requirement for all visitors to be tested and strictly adhere to the guidelines before being allowed to cross the Kenyan borders. He said the government is still assessing the level of preparedness along its borders, especially in countries that have recorded a surge in the virus. Kanyiri said they will engage the County Covid-19 emergency and Response Committee to involve the neighbouring communities in tackling the virus.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
