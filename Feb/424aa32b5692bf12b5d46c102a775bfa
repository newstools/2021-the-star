Posta Rangers assistant captain Joseph Mbugi is likely to be rested when the mailmen tackle Bidco United today at the Moi Stadium,Kasarani. Rangers will be seeking their second win in the 2020-2021 Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Premier League season when they play the debutants in a battle which coach Sammy ‘Pamzo’ Omollo anticipates will be close to call. Pamzo revealed his intentions to overlook the defensive midfielder whom he noted was fatigued having been deployed to shield the defence in the previous ten rounds. The tactician alleged that the tired legs in his camp were as a result of playing league matches both in the weekends and mid-week hence the need to ring changes in the starting team. “I expect the match to be tough and thus I have to make a handful of changes from the team which played AFC Leopards last weekend. Mbugi is among the players I will rest as fatigue is slowly creeping in the team thanks to playing every weekend and midweek. The fresh legs will play a significant role in annihilating Bidco who I reckon will come out guns blazing for the three points,” he disclosed With the three points at stake, Pamzo will be banking on their preparations to bag them and scale three places in the log. Rangers are currently placed 12th with ten points,two ahead of their match day opponents who are ranked 15th. Should the league newbies who will also be gunning for their second win of the season floor Rangers, they will similarly climb three places high. “We played well against Leopards especially in the second half and I have challenged my players to pick from where we left. The match will be won by the team which will approach it with a winning mentality and I have been preparing my boys to have the right mindset and have their eyes on the three points,” he expressed In the meantime, Pamzo said the decision to part ways with the trio of Bill Oporia, Collins Okumu and Salim Odeka was meant to create room for the incoming forwards. The three were the first casualties to be axed following the opening of the local transfer window. “It was a tough decision to drop them but we needed room for the new recruits. We have been doing well defensively and we have to add more punch upfront by signing new strikers,” he added.        ,
