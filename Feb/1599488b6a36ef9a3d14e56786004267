A CCTV security system will be installed at the Busia  county government headquarters, officials said on Monday. Chief officer in the governor's office Lydia Nabwire made the disclosure after   signing a contract with Denca Ltd for the installation of a CCTV system at the county headquarters. Nabwire said the decision to install new CCTV surveillance system followed destruction of a previous one by a fire. Technical operations manager at Denca Eric Nderitu said  the CCTV system to be installed will be hacker-proof with 20 cameras strategically positioned to detect motion. "The PTZ cameras are autospan that rotate at 360 degrees, giving sharp and clean objects with no risk of interference," he said, adding that they will monitor the safety of staff and property.
