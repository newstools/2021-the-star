A magistrate's court has reviewed bail terms issued to a transgender woman charged with obtaining credit by false pretences. Magistrate Martha Mutuku reduced the bail granted to Katie Antonina Wanjiku, alias Stephen Kamotho, from Sh200,000 to Sh50,000. The bail was reviewed after an assessment report was filed in court by probation officer Consolota Makori. The magistrate had demanded the report after Wanjiku told court she could not meet the bail terms. The purpose of the report was to gather information about the accused person's family, personal circumstances and economic means to consequently guide the court in a review of bail terms. Wanjiku, 41, was born male. She is single and has no children. The report indicates she has a strained relationship with most family members who are in denial of her gender identity. They have not accepted him to date. She also told the officer that she suffers from a major depressive disorder. “The gender crisis and low self-esteem have been the major contributors to mental illness. In addition, the lack of acceptance by her family members and society at large makes matters worse. Discrimination in the job market has also been a major contributor to the deterioration of her mental illness,” the report reads. The report also indicates that she does not have any savings or assets that can be used to secure her release as she lives hand-to-mouth. It adds that she was genuinely concerned about her safety if remanded. “I feared harassment and victimisation. That's why I prayed that the court reduces my bail to Sh30,000, an amount I will loan from my friend Beatrice Chepchirchir. She is willing to be sworn in as my personal guarantor," she said. Wanjiku was charged on Monday. It is alleged that between December 16 last year and February 3 at Marble Arch Hotel Limited, she obtained Sh488,510 by false pretence. She denied the charge.
