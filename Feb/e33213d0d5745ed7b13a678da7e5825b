Embu assembly Majority leader Michael Njeru has urged MCAs to pay back President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s Sh2 million car grant by passing the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Speaking when the Bill was tabled for debate, Njeru urged Jubilee MCAs to support the changes because it is party policy. He said the Bill promises several goodies to the Mt Kenya region and all Jubilee MCAs are expected to vigorously push its agenda. Deputy speaker Steve Simba had asked the Majority leader to update the assembly on the status of the Bill. Njeru confirmed that plans to pass the Bill were on course, saying many MCAs had pledged to throw their weight behind the constitutional amendment drive. He said the assembly will hold public participation forums across the county on Wednesday next week. Adequate copies of the BBI document would be reproduced to help sensitise the public to its contents. The Kithimu MCA said massive misinformation had been peddled by opponents of the Bill. Ward reps would now take it upon themselves to conduct civic education on the positive aspects of the BBI, he said. Njeru said the Bill brings an extra constituency, ward development fund and better funding for Embu county. He thanked Uhuru for giving ward reps car grants and assured his colleagues that the cash would be deposited into their accounts soon. Njeru said the assembly administration is finalising the modalities to implement the car grant circular issued by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission.
