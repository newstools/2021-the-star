The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has summoned 18 members from Baringo county over the misconduct during the BBI Amendment Bill 2020 debate on Thursday last week. In a statement released on Thursday by the commission’s South Rift Regional Office, the 18 members have been asked to appear before the commission for interrogation. They have been asked to appear in person at the regional office in Nakuru from Monday. The Assembly has been asked to furnish the commission with the personal files of the two MCAs Charles Kosgei and Ernest Kibet. Also, the commission has asked for the Hansard dated February 11; a report taken so far regarding the incident as well as any other information relating to the matter. The commission’s investigators Roselyne Omondi and Erick Kirui said they will be available to collect the documents, interview, and record the statements. The Assembly’s Principal Sergeant at Arms David Ngeno, and Sergeant at Arms Amos Kiprob Cherangony and Tobole Sumokwo Logorio are among the 18. The twelve MCAs include Silas Tochim, Maria Losile, Solomon Makal, Caroline Kessei, Betty Birchogo, Shadrack Mailuk, Lawi Kipchumba, Lourien Sam, Daniel Tuwit, and Reuben Chepsongol. Also, Assembly Speaker David Kiplagat, his deputy Jacob Cheboiwo and the county Clerk Richard Koech have been summoned. During the chaotic debate, riot police were called to intervene. Teargas was thrown into the chamber by police just before the speaker declared 30 MCAs had rejected the Bill while 11 had voted in favour. Up to date, Baringo County Assembly is the only one that has rejected the Bill, while twelve counties have passed it. A section of Baringo MCAs on Monday sought to block the rejection of the Bill. Through lawyer Gordon Ogola, they petitioned the High Court in Kabarnet. “My clients are contesting the shambolic process, acrimony, and the harassment against them during the process. We pray that the judge will give a fair judgment to their plea,” Ogola said.
