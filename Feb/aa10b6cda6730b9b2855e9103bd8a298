Until March 14, motorists will pay Sh115.18 for a litre of petrol in Nairobi, Sh101.91 for diesel and Sh92.44 for a litre of kerosene.

Diesel increases from  Sh96.40 a litre while Kerosene, used for lighting and cooking by poor households, has increased from Sh87.12 a litre. Acting Director General Daniel Kiptoo in a statement said the changes in this month’s prices are as a result of the average landed cost of imported super petrol increasing by 20.93 per cent from $323.52 per cubic meter in December 2020 to $391.24 per cubic meter in January 2021. “Diesel increasing by 13.64 per cent from $322.22 to $377.55 per cubic meter and Kerosene increasing by 14.60 per cent from $302.97 per cubic meter to $347.19 per cubic meter,” Kiptoo said.
