Controversial singer Willy Paul has taken the legal route in defending himself against defamation of his character and brand. On Monday, Willy Paul went to the Central police station and reported a young female fan by the name Ruth, who claimed she got pregnant after a steamy night with the 'Liar' hitmaker. The report was made early this month even before the matter went public on February 3. The police put down the offence on the occurrence book as “defamation”. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, Ruth admitted to have been arrested but later released. "The arrest started as a set-up. I was told to go for an Interview in one of the leading TV stations for a lifestyle show. I trusted them, so when I went for 'shooting' at TRM, that's where I was arrested." She says she was put behind bars for more than eight hours. "Willy Paul was not with the police, he came later at the station," she said. "They wanted cash bail, I didn't have money, so I don't know why I was released because it got to a point I was released." Willy Paul on the other hand says he took the legal action to clear his name. "At the station, the girl mentioned everyone that sent her to ruin my name. It is some upcoming producers," the singer told Word Is.
