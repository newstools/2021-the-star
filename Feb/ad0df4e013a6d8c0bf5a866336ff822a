The ICT ministry will this month launch a digital programme to empower scouts with skills for logical thinking. The initiative targets 1,000 Chipukizi (youthful) scouts. It will be first rolled out in  Nairobi, Machakos, Nyeri and Embu counties before being taken to other regions. The programme dubbed ‘CS First Unplugged’ will be implemented in partnership with Google East Africa. ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru announced the new programme on Friday at the Rowallan Scouts Camp in Nairobi where he was crowned head of the Kenyan chapter of the global movement. Mucheru’s admission into the scout's family was presided over by the Kenya Scouts Association chief commissioner and board chairman Victor Radido. The CS was adorned in the Scouts uniform during the colourful ceremony. He was given a world badge enlisting him as a member of the global movement. Rowallan's membership in Kenya stands at 2.1 million. The KSA is part of the global scouting movement, a voluntary non -political and educational movement for young people of all gender, race, tribe or creed. It was founded by Lord Baden Powell in 1907. Mucheru said the ministry will leverage its activities to ensure KSA realises its objectives of moulding the youth into responsible citizens who are physically, intellectually, socially, spiritually and emotionally developed.
