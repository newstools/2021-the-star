A Sh6 million twin workshop building is set to be built at Sabrina Vocational Training Centre in Matuga to enhance learning of practical classes. Governor Salim Mvurya said the facility will be ready in less than 11 months. Mvurya said the building will provide youth with an opportunity to learn a wide variety of job skills. "It is my great expectation that this facility will be a game-changer for the young lives pursuing practical courses, " he said. Mvurya said the skills will empower youth to compete effectively and secure jobs in and out of the county. He spoke on Saturday in an interview in Kwale headquarters in Matuga. Over 34 vocational training centres have so far been built in Kwale. Mvurya said his government is committed to enhancing literacy levels and fight poverty through education. He asked the residents to take advantage of the Technical and Vocational Training Center to amass knowledge. The county chief said to effectively beat the unemployment crisis, youth need to be equipped with skills that promote creativity and innovation. "We are working hard to unveil more job opportunities but the focus is to also empower young lives to come up with self-employment undertakings, " he said. The governor said his administration has worked tirelessly in sponsoring talented youths, offering school bursaries to the needy and empowering locals through various livelihood projects. In 2013, the county launched the Elimu Ni Sasa Foundation where over 4,000 students in national schools and 2,000 in universities are under full sponsorship. The county normally allocates Sh400 million to support the bursary and sponsorship programme. Mvurya, however, warned the contractor against doing shoddy and substandard work.
