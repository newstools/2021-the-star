This is a message to Senator Ledama Olekina, a keen advocate of legalising marijuana. Nothing is as demoralising as having bad teeth. The tar that comes from smoking marijuana or cigarettes discolours and weakens teeth. I say this because smoking is the most common way of consuming bhang in Kenya. However, this is a flimsy reason to argue against legalising marijuana. I would implore you to divest yourself of the notion that legalising smoking of marijuana is good for the country’s socioeconomic wellbeing. No amount of legislation, however good, would change a morally rotten society. This is because man is so ferocious and avaricious that every conceivable law has been passed to safeguard him from his fellow man. Don’t you then think that legalising smoking of marijuana would aggravate our problems rather than solve them and negate our aspirations of a sane society? You may want to visit Lwanda market in Vihiga county in order to appreciate the havoc wreaked by the reckless use of marijuana. Your call to legalise marijuana smoking could be construed as seeking cheap popularity for political mileage among the youth. Otherwise you would have worked with professionals for better advice on the same. A well meaning leader would have advocated the legalisation of the use (note I have advertently used the word “use” not smoke) of marijuana in institutions. This is because marijuana as a plant is not as useless as people would think.
