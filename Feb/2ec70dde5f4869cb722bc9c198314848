Kenya is increasingly becoming a dangerous place to live in. I’m not exaggerating. Picture this, it’s just a few minutes past 7pm. People are walking home from work, children and adults are standing outside a row of shops making purchases for supper and the next day’s breakfast. A Probox and a motorcycle are driven and parked in front of the shops. No one pays attention. The shops are along a tarmacked, well-lit busy road in Nairobi. Suddenly the people, children included, outside the shops are accosted by thieves and ordered to hand over all their money. The shopkeepers are not left out. They have more money after all. Unsuspecting pedestrians are also accosted, their bags snatched and thrown into the Probox. After their rampage, the thieves drive away. All these took place some metres away from the area police station, towards the end of last year. Just this week a guard was attacked by metal vandals as he was heading to work. The thugs set upon him, stabbing him and slashing him simply for being a security guard. If we were to ask around, the tales of mugging, either to oneself or people we know, would fill an entire library. So my question is, what is the government doing to protect us? Frankly, I’m feeling scared and I know many other Kenyans can relate. I’m a Christian and will say my security is in God’s hands, but that does not mean government doesn’t have a responsibility to keep all citizens safe. It’s their God-given duty.
