The Lamu Water and Sewerage Company has asked residents to sparingly use their reserves because rationing is imminent as the county's reservoirs are drying up. Water sources have dwindled following a drought that began in January. Lamu’s fresh water supply comes from wells situated inside dunes located in the Shella area. They are almost depleted. Speaking in Lamu on Wednesday, Lawasco managing director Kimani Wainaina urged resident to save water as much as they can to reduce over-dependence on the little available in the wells. The plan is to prevent the reservoirs from drying up. Wainaina advised residents to limit water consumption and wastage by switching off toilet cisterns among other things. Three major wells have dried up and the remaining have little left as the drought persists. “There is a reduced water supply and from the look of things, the shortage is not ending any time soon. Let us utilise the water we have because no one knows when the taps might run dry‚” Wainaina said. Residents of Mokowe, Manda, Kiangwe and other parts of Lamu town have raised concerns about water shortages on several occasions. Last week, Manda airport was in the news over an acute water shortage, a situation that threatened to destabilise activities at the airport. Staff and passenger toilets had to be shut down due to the water shortage. Labourers at the airport have been forced to fetch water using boats from Shella, 10 kilometres away.
