Traders in Naivasha are selling students cakes and sweets laced with drugs, contributing to school unrest and arson. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mutua Kisilu said on Wednesday students are buying sweets and cakes containing drugs, which he did not identify. A popular donut known as 'KDF' commonly contains drugs, authorities said. Members of the area security committee said informal structures around schools were the main source of drugs. Since schools reopened in January, 31 fires, mostly caused by arson, have broken out, as of Tuesday. Naivasha High School was closed for two weeks after students rioted and torched one dormitory that was severely damaged. Five students were arrested. Commissioner Kisilu said in his office that a fight between students in Forms 4 and 5 over control and sale of the donuts led to the arson attack. “In the case of Naivasha High School, we discovered the KDF cake was laced with drugs and we are after those involved in this illegal trade,” he said. Kisilu warned students, saying anyone involved in the arson attacks would have to face the law, regardless of their age. “The parents will have to pay for the losses incurred by the students who will have to stay at home or in remand until their cases are heard by the courts and determined,” he said. Earlier, Naivasha principal magistrate Joseph Karanja directed the court to provide a lawyer for the five students charged with burning the school. A court-ordered age assessment determined the students were all minors, aged 17. They are accused of jointly torching a dorm on January 28. The destroyed property was valued at Sh2.4 million. The magistrate directed the probation office to supply the court with a social behaviour report on the students and ordered that they be held at Naivasha police station awaiting to be charged.
