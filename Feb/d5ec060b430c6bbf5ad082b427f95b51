The roadmap for the Competency Based Curriculum was unveiled on Tuesday. It is now clear that the pioneers of the system, Grade 4 pupils, have clear career pathways. The system advocates learning to learn and more emphasis is put on core competencies that are instrumental for the holistic growth and development of a child. CBC will provide solutions to some of the problems ailing our society, such as indiscipline and general lack of moral values. The remedy for student unrest, for instance, lies with the CBC. The curriculum underscores the important role that parents play in a child’s upbringing. Parents and guardians are the first and continuing educators. School administrators should involve parents in the running of the institutions since they have a shared responsibility in providing a conducive environment for learners to achieve their full potential. There is a great need to build effective partnerships between parents, the community and schools. CBC is not exam-oriented, therefore, learners will not be in panic mode when exams are around the corner. Exams have been blamed for student unrest. From the adopted task force’s report on curriculum reforms implementation, a national exam will be administered to Grade 9 learners by the Kenya National Examination Council to give them a chance to be placed in various pathways stipulated in the Basic Education Curriculum Framework 2017. The pathways are Arts and Sports, Social Sciences, and Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Another exam will be administered at Grade 12 to to place learners in technical colleges and universities. Continuous assessment tests will account for 60 per cent of the total marks.
