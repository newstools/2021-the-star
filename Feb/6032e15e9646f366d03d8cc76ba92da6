Mr. Michaels is a large man and I suspect he displays the kind of character that, in a school playground, would have fellow students eyeing him nervously. But in the world of work, in Africa just as much as anywhere else, I can see the age of the school bully coming to an end. For a couple of good reasons. First, and most important is that the younger generation of employees simply will not put up with being bullied. They will vote with their feet and, as they leave an employer, they will lay a trail on social media or employee review sites like Glass Door for potential employees to read. Second, the rise of women to senior positions in the African workplace. Generally we observe that women bring a higher degree of empathy and encourage greater levels of responsibility and discretionary effort from employees. Women also tend to be better at displaying their own moral compass as a reference point for staff to copy. Chris Harrison leads The Brand Inside in Africa www.thebrandinsideafrica.com
