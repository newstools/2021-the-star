TV show 'Foods of Kenya' is back. Hosted by Mwaniki Mageria, the show explores the traditional culinary history and cooking methods of different Kenyan communities handed down along the ages. "At the onset of another great season of Foods of Kenya, we are excited to document healthy foods and recipes from way back and at the same time enjoy culture as it evolves in this modern-day, while holding on to some other things that our forefathers taught us," Mageria said. Show creator Eugene Mbugua said the show took a break in 2020, which allowed them to put in more work into their production quality and overall style of storytelling. "We hope that these improvements will be a gift to our audiences new and old," Mbugua said.
