Despite beating Kisumu All Starlets 3-0, Vihiga Queens coach Alex Alumira insists they will have to be clinical in front of goal when they take on Trans-Nzoia Falcons this weekend. The routine victory saw Queens open a three-point gap at the top of the table with 16 points after Trans-Nzoia Falcons (13 points)were held to a 1-1 draw by Oserian. Trans-Nzoia have 13. Queens' striker Tereza Engesha took her season tally to 10 in six matches following her double with Faith Marende also on the scoresheet. Alumira was pleased with the clean sheet but wants his charges to be ruthless in the opposition's goal. He said they would have won by a bigger margin had it not been for the wastefulness of his strikers. "Players played according to instructions and the three points is deserved. However, our attack still needs to convert one-on-one chances. We missed some five big chances that would have completely changed the scoreline," said the three-time title-winning coach. His opposite number, Juma Saidi, bemoaned the manner in which his side gave away easy goals while losing the midfield battle. Saidi expects his players back to the training camp on Tuesday. He said financial problems have hit the team while lack of personnel is also derailing their title ambitions. "Our preparations for the week were not good. We only have one goalkeeper who was forced to play without fully recovering and had not trained," said Saidi. "Our midfield was overrun and we conceded some easy goals. Financial challenges have adversely affected us but we will bounce back stronger." Meanwhile, second-half goals from Yvonne Ogada and Monica Naswa powered SEP Oyugis to a 2-1Â  victory against Eldoret Falcons. Falcons recorded their sixth consecutive loss of the season in the league. Wadadia beat Nakuru West 3-1. Elsewhere in Zone 'A', leaders Thika Queens hammered Kibera Soccer 8-1 while Zetech Sparks beat Mathare United 3-1 and Kayole hit Makolanders 2-0.
