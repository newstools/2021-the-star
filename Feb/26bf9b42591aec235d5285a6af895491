Police on Saturday recovered the body of an unidentified man suspected to be in his late 20s in Mavoko, Machakos county. Athi River subcounty police commander George Kashimiri said the body was discovered by residents of Acre Fund village in Kamulu at around 2pm. They reported the matter to Joska police station. Detectives from the Homicide Department visited the scene. Police removed the body to the City Mortuary for an autopsy. Kashimiri said the deceased could be part of a gang and his killers might have turned their guns on one of their own following a disagreement. The deceased wasn’t known to the locals. “The boda boda operator was ferrying his clients who turned out to be thugs. They shot him dead and stole the motorbike which they used to speed off thereby escaping from the murder scene. It is suspected that all of them could be thugs who killed one of their own in what looks like a disagreement over something or a deal gone sour,” the police boss told the Star by phone on Sunday. He said the deceased didn’t have any identification document when the body was being removed from the scene. “Nobody from the area knew him .He wasn’t immediately identified. That’s the reason body was moved to the City Mortuary where the identification can be done by experts,” Kashimiri said. He said there was no arrest yet, though police had launched investigations into the matter. Kashimiri called on the public to volunteer information on the incidednt to help in the probe and arrest of suspects involved in the murder.
