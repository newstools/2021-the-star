Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga has rubbished claims he is pushing for BBI to ascend to the presidency. Raila on Friday said that his handshake with President Uhuru Kenya was meant to address a myriad of challenges facing the country. He said it is Kenyans who will make a decision to elect a president of their choice. Raila spoke at Kisii during the funeral service for former Bonchari MP Oroo Oiyoka. The MP died on February 15, at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Kisumu where he was undergoing treatment. Meanwhile, speaking at a separate function, DP William Ruto said he is comfortable under any constitutional dispensation. Ruto added he had no problem with either the current or amendments under the BBI. He spoke at the new Kamarich Tea factory in Aldai constituency when he commissioned the facility owned by Sireet Tea empowerment company, a firm owned by small-scale tea growers. The BBI secretariat on Wednesday announced it will officially start campaigns to popularise the initiative next week. Co-chair Junet Mohammed said the secretariat will form committees to spearhead the campaigns. "We shall start the campaigns on March 1 and we shall have 10 committees that will spearhead the exercise across the country," Junet said. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila will be leading the BBI popularisation exercise in all the regions. More to follow...
