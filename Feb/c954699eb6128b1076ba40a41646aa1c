Police are investigating claims of sexual assault and harassment at the Ministry of Lands headquarters at Ardhi House in Nairobi. Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers launched the probe after female staff took to social media to express their frustrations at the hands of some senior officials. The staffers said they are being subjected to unwanted sexual overtures at night. The detectives have appealed to the victims to come forward and record statements with them. The matter was reported internally, leading to last week's cancellation of night shifts at the registry. Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri declined to comment on the matter. “There is nothing I can say about those claims,” he said. The night shift was started to help clear backlog of files but the office could now be faced with delays in the issuance of land titles. The Star has also learnt that the Human Resource Department at Ardhi House is also seized of the matter, with investigations already underway.
