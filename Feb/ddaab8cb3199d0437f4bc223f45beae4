Verification was completed on February 18. Twenty-four assemblies are needed to pass the Bill for a referendum to happen. Twelve have passed it so far. Counties that have passed the Bill are Samburu, Nairobi, Vihiga, Laikipia, Kisii, Siaya, Kisumu, Kajiado, West Pokot, Busia, Trans Nzoia and Homa Bay.
