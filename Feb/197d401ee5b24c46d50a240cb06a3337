The Busia government is training county enforcement officers on the contents of the County Trade Act 2017. Trade executive Judith Maketso said the intention of the meeting is to help the officers understand their roles in the Act to avoid cases where enforcement officers are found handling duties meant for finance and trade officers. She spoke during the opening of a two-day workshop for officials from the department of Trade Investment, Industry and Cooperatives. Chief officer Nelson Kwamini encouraged the officers to brainstorm on the best way to implement the Act as they get to understand their roles. "Trade department cannot implement the Act without the support of the enforcement department, so let's understand what the Act is all about to help us realise its intended purpose," he said. County attorney Justice Anyara Emukule said the Act requires them to facilitate and promote trade to enable traders to grow. "A fundamental change in the 2010 Constitution authorises county officers to work under the county trade Act which is within the law," he said. But in the event a trader persistently denies the officers access to his/her premises, the law allows them to seek a search warrant from the magistrate.
