Kisii County Assembly on Thursday became the eighth county to pass the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment), Bill 2020. The 68 MCAs present during the morning session unanimously voted to pass the Bill. Nominated MCA Eric Janganya said the MCAs passed the Bill after extensive public participation across the county. Kisii Governor James Ongwae said he was excited and proud of the MCAs for passing the Bill. He said Kisii leaders will continue to sensitize the people on the Bill ahead of the referendum. He asked Kenyans to ignore propaganda and innuendoes by those opposed to the Bill.  “We have taken up the task to mobilize registered voters throughout the county to help actualize the constitutional amendment in the forthcoming Referendum,” said Ogugu. Other counties that have passed the Bill include Siaya, Kisumu, Kajiado, West Pokot, Busia, Trans Nzoia and Homa Bay. So far, only Barongo County has rejected the Bill. Twenty-four out of 47 counties are required to pass the Bill
