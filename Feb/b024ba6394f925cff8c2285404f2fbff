Members of the County Government Workers Union Embu chapter on Tuesday voted out almost all their officials and elected new ones. Only secretary Benson Njeru, vice-treasurer Edward Mugambi and vice-woman rep Mwajuma Salim were spared. The election took place at the Embu town social hall. Counting of votes ended at 8pm. Outgoing chairman Ephantus Mwaniki, who has led the union for over 15 years, was floored by Cosmas Nyaga.  Nyaga is the outgoing youth leader. Mwaniki garnered 72 votes against Nyaga's 272 votes. Charles Mugambi was elected vice-chairman, Alosius Mwangangi (vice-secretary), Dorcas Kanampiu (treasurer), Denis Muchangi (youth representative) and Jane Wanjiru (Woman representative). Njeru said the union’s operations were not running smoothly owing to lack of funds. This, he said, is due to a failure by the county government to deduct members’ contributions from their salaries and remit them to the union. He said they struggled to organise the elections and are looking for ways to solve the problem with the county government to resume the deductions and remit them to the union to sustain its activities. Elections committee member Abdullahi Salat said the union's aim is not to fight the government but to seek better working conditions for its members.
