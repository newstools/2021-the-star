Kenya National Rally Championship defending champion Baldev Singh Chager has predicted an eventful season upon return to action from a Covid-19 enforced break. Chager said many drivers are eager for the season to commence and will give their best to wrestle the crown from him when the action goes down at the season opener in Nakuru this weekend. "I have been in the sport for many many years and it has come to a point where we seek to do our best. So it's all or nothing. We are just eager to get behind the wheel and see how rusty we may have become over the Covid-19 break," Chager said. Chager, alongside co-driver Ravi Soni,  said he is looking to get himself in the best position for back-to-back titles. "At the recent autocross event, it was quite interesting being behind the wheel and in speed after a very long lay-off. Our last rally was in Nyahururu on March 8 last year. It took quite a few kilometres trying to settle back to the feeling of driving. It went quite well and I am looking forward to Nakuru this weekend," Chager added. The defending champion has been undertaking last-minute finishes on his Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 10. He has been on a comprehensive test drive with his Kabras Sugar Racing teammates Onkar and Tejveer Rai, who also tested their identical VW Polo R5 cars. "The  Kabras cars have been ready for a while now and we were overly excited with a test session last week. A few more kilometres and we should be good to go," he said. The KCB Nakuru Rally 2021 will start and end at Soysambu ranch, featuring 175Km total mileage. The event will also feature a three-stage loop, which will be repeated for a total competitive distance of 141km making up 80 per cent of the rally.
