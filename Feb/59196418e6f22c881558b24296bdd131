Nairobi City Stars have signed Kenyan international left-back Balton Omwenga from Tanzania’s Vodacom Premier League side Biashara United Mara. Omwenga, who previously played for KCB, Nzoia Sugar and Kariobangi Sharks signed a one and half year contract for Simba wa Nairobi. The five-foot-six left-footer, capped twice by Kenya and four times for the U23 Emerging Stars, was philosophical upon his arrival. “It’s an honour to be part of Nairobi City Stars. Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress and working together is a success. Together as a team and with good effort, we will get good results,” he told the club’s official website. Head coach Sanjin Alagic stated: “Balton has rare qualities as a player and has a very good experience. I have no doubt he will be of great value to City Stars.” Omwenga adds onto City Stars left-foot department that also has Herit Mungai Atariza, Wesley Onguso, John Kamau and fullback utility Calvin Masawa, the team’s overall skipper. He will don jersey no. 17 His International Transfer Certificate (ITC) has already been issued by the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) and its only a matter of time before he makes his debut for Simba wa Nairobi. He joined the Mwanza-based side, which is being handled by former Kenyan international Francis Baraza, at the beginning of the season. Meanwhile, Nigerian Michael Karamor is among several players who have signed for Western Stima. Unfortunately, Karamor arrived at a time when the club is rocked by match-fixing scandals with club chairman Laban Jobita threatening to sack all his 28 players and recruit afresh. Others who have signed for the Kisumu-based side are Ugandans Martin Mpuuga and Isaac Doka. Stima played to a 1-1 draw against Mathare United in new coach Abdallah Juma’s first match. Juma took over from Paul Ogai, who parted ways with the club on Tuesday.
