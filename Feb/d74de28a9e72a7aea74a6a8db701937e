Ugandan political activist, Stella Nyanzi, has fled to Kenya. According to a report by Ugandan media Daily Monitor, Nyanzi's lawyer George Luchiri Wajackoyah confirmed the news citing political persecution by President Yoweri Museveni's government. Nyanzi, a former research fellow at Makerere University who ran for Kampala Woman MP seat in last month’s general election, allegedly arrived in Nairobi by bus on Saturday. According to her lawyer,  Nyanzi is seeking political asylum in Kenya. “The abductions and detentions of political actors were getting closer to me, my children have been targets of police trailing, I just left prison in February last year and I don’t want to go back,” Nyanzi told Nation.Africa in a telephone interview. She reportedly crossed the Uganda-Kenya border “in disguise” to avoid detection by security agents. Her children are also “in a safe house” in Nairobi. The Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) candidate came third in the January 14, parliamentary elections. She has been vocal over her will to call for accountability, fight against corruption and oppression of minorities.
