Nominated MP Isaac Mwaura has termed his disciplinary process as a 'witch hunt' because of his support for the Deputy President William Ruto. The lawmaker claimed disciplinary committee has a formed opinion to have him expelled. He said both Jubilee Chairman Nelson Nzuiya and Vice Chairman David Murathe have publicly vouched for his removal. The second term MP said he has no faith in the committee. "You already have a determined position. David Murathe has actually said am going to be expelled and he has also declared he will support Raila Amollo Odinga for president, this meeting is just pure witch hunt," Mwaura said. The MP however said he is a loyal party member who has never gone against party position at the senate. "I am a paid up members of Jubilee Party. I pay Sh20,000 every month. I have never voted against any Jubilee party position. I have strongly defended the party position even when the party position is not clear to anyone," he said. The lawmaker is appearing before the Jubilee Disciplinary committee chaired by lawyer Muchai Lumatete. "Maina Kamanda another nominated members has been openly campaign for ODM candidate in Kibra. Why didn't you summon him. That to me , it is discrimination. You are implying partiality"
