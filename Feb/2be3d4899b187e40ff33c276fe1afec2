The Uhuru succession debate has gripped the nation. And is expected of any politician worth their salt, every key gathering has been converted to a stomping ground for self-serving promises. In their toxic whistle-stop rallies, vulgar politicians target their rivals with very crass and emotive language. The net effect is to ratchet up political tensions at a time Kenyans are still grappling with devastating economic and social effects of Covid-19. Large swathes of the population are struggling to meet their basic needs. But the ever selfish politicians are oblivious to citizens' real needs. One would imagine the most important thing the politicians ought to concentrate on right now is pursuing development agendas as opposed to endless political one-upmanship. The frenetic political activity ought to be brought down. This is not the route the country wants to go having learnt a painful lesson in the 2007 post-election violence where lives were lost, homes destroyed and businesses ruined. It is time the Church, as a neutral institution, stood up as the voice of reason and led the nation into peaceful 2022 election. The state needs to monitor the political rallies keenly with an aim of cracking down on incitement so it does not snowball out of control. Kenyans too have a part to play by rejecting divisive and inciting messages and maintaining peace because a politically charged unstable environment is dangerous for all.
