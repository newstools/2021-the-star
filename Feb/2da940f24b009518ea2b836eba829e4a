The Sh1.86 billion Thika bypass project is set to be completed in July. According to the Kenya Urban Roads Authority, the 21km project is currently at 72 per cent complete. As indicated in a statement released on Tuesday by the authority,  the bypass WILL help to ease congestion on the South Eastern and Northern part of the Town and connects Muranga Road to Garissa Road as well as diverts traffic from Garissa away from the CBD. "Thika Town is one of the urban towns that has greatly benefitted from road linkages upgraded in the last five years. It includes the near completion of Thika Bypass that has eased traffic gridlock ". In June 2019, Kura started  the tarmacking of Phase 1 of the Thika bypass from BAT to Kiganjo and later extension to Athena-Witeithie-Thika Superhighway. Phase 2  involves the construction of the 15-kilometre Thika-Kenol Highway with link roads to Kenyatta Highway-Munene Industries, UTI-Pilot-Umoja, and Kenyatta Leather-Garissa Road. At the same time, Kura has awarded a contract for the rehabilitation and upgrade of roads within Juja and Thika towns. Interests Works Ltd has been awarded the contract for the 24km project that will see the Road from Gatuanyaga-Munyu- Githima- Kisii Road tarmacked as well as rehabilitation of Kwame Nkurumah Street, Uhuru Street and Mama Ngina Drive in the CBD. All these road network will restore Thika town as a major modern industrial hub and create employment for youths. JKUAT is set to benefit from the project as Kura will be constructing walkways and cycle paths around the institution. "This will improve security and dignity within the institution and its surroundings as well as its environs and will serve the huge population residing and working in both towns," reads the statement.
