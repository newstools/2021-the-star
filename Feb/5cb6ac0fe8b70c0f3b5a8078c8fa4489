Kirinyaga county will build a factory using husks and other agricultural waste to produce furniture boards. The factory, a major value-addition plants in the county, will be funded by the British Government's UKAID-funded Sustainable Urban Economic Development Programme (Sued). Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru praised the British government for partnering with her county in socio-economic development. She spoke during a meeting with governors of the Central Region Economic Bloc counties. UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott attended. Waiguru said Kirinyaga will be putting up a husks' factory in which the byproducts of coffee, cassava and rice will be made into furniture boards. It will provide jobs, improve livelihoods, provide extra income for farmers and promote the county's development agenda. Through Sued, the county is developing an Urban Economic Plan for the Kerugoya/Kutus municipality, expected to be completed by August. Waiguru said the plan will promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth through integrated projects. It aims to make the county an investment hub. She urged the UK to extend similar economic empowerment programmes to other counties in the bloc. Only Kirinyaga and Tharaka Nithi among the 10 bloc counties qualified for the Sued programme. High Commissioner Marriott said the UK and Kenya have cordial relations and Britain is willing to extend development programmes to more counties in the Central region. The counties in the bloc are Kirinyaga, Embu, Kiambu, Murangâ€™a, Laikipia, Meru, Nakuru, Nyandarua, Nyeri and Tharaka Nithi. (Edited by V. Graham)
