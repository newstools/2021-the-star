A Kiambu lobby group has raised concerns over beatings, deliberate starvation, denial of conjugal rights and eviction of men from their homes in the county. Voice of Men and Children lobby says the trend is worrying since most men remain silent about what their wives are doing to them at home. Vomec chairman Bishop James Njenga said victims fear disclosing their maltreatment because they do not want to be seen as cowards and being controlled by women. Bishop Njenga said that some few report these cases at chiefs offices seeking instructions regarding their property. "Some feel they are being mistreated because of their property and money and hence a few report to chief's or assistant chief's offices. However, when men turn on their wives, they are reported at police stations and men are arrested and taken to court where they are charge," he said. The chairman who is also the Bishop of Compassion Revival Church advised couples to talk about their differences with a close friend who can help them, a pastor or look for marriage counsellors. "Disagreements in marriage are common. The most important thing is to share what one is going through with a person who will help them handle them such as a close pastor or a professional marriage counsellor," he said. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
