Angry residents on Monday brought down posters advertising the services of astrologers and witchdoctors in Nyeri town, saying they don't believe in witchcraft. The posters were plucked out of electricity posts, trees and walls of buildings. The residents were led by Rware MCA Paul Kanyari. Kanyari said he had received several complaints of residents who are furious with the mushrooming of the posters and signboards in the town. He said he will mobilise traders, residents, the church and county government officials to help in bringing the posters down. “I am planning to have all of them removed. They should be brought down and burnt because Nyeri people are God-fearing and will not entertain witchcraft,” Kanyari said. The ward representative said the posters are often put up at night by thugs masquerading as witchdoctors. Their intention is to con people, he said. “They are not witchdoctors but con artists who are after fleecing residents. That is unacceptable,” Kanyari said. People claiming to be witchdoctors and astrologers have been advertising their services claiming they can cure all problems from exorcising demons, making stubborn debtors pay up, solving divorce issues, relationships breakdowns, low libido in men, financial difficulties, alcohol addiction and infertility among others. They often indicate their mobile phone numbers on the posters so clients can reach out to them. County government officials said they were aware of the posters but were not told they would be pulled down. Executives Beth Karimi (environment) and Robert Thuo (Finance) said they were not aware of the step taken by the residents. Resident Eliud Mwaura said the posters are put up at night and that no one had ever seen those behind them. "You wake up and find a poster on the wall," Mwaura said. Peninah Njoki said the posters had created a feeling of superstition in the area.  Edited by P.O
