Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has intensified Building Bridges Initiative popularisation campaigns. This came barely three days after the Machakos county assembly unanimously passed the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. It was the 21st assembly to do so. The Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader and presidential aspirant on Thursday hit the ground running, urging those opposed to the bill to stop misleading Kenyans. Mutua dismissed those opposed to the initiative as prophets of doom. He was at the same time on a development tour of Mwala. He said the Constitution is not being replaced as claimed by some leaders. It is only being amended to improve governance and service to the people, he said. The county boss further said no new positions will be created. He said the total number of Cabinet members will remain the same.Â He said the proposed changes will increase funds devolved to the counties for the benefit of citizens. He urged the remaining counties to pass the Bill so that it can be forwarded to Wananchi for voting. Only Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet and Mandera have yet to vote. The minimum 24-assembly threshold has, however, been met and the bill now proceed to a referendum via Parliament. The national BBI steering committee has scheduled the official launch of nationwide BBI campaigns for Monday.
