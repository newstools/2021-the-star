On his tour within the outskirts of Nairobi, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised youths the return of Kazi Mtaani initiative, which I think is an irony to the young people of Kenya. Youths always complain on social media about lack of jobs and opportunities. At the time they were being promised the slasher and shovel jobs by the President, former Nairobi Speaker Beatrice Elachi had been appointed a CAS. She was among changes the President effected in hi government, where retirees and relatives were rewarded with state jobs. Elachi's appointment, among others, is not good news to unemployed youths of Kenya. Not long ago, former Vice President Moody Awori, who is now 92, was appointed to the Board of Sports, Arts and Social Development Fund. Is the government really sincere to our youths? Most of those who were promised Kazi Mtaani have good qualifications, some more than Elachi and other appointees. I am urging the government to consider youths when making state appointments not remembering them when it wants them to clean the streets. Abel Arimba-Nyamira
