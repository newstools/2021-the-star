Deputy President William Ruto has asked politicians not to diminish President Uhuru Kenyatta’s profile to that of a Mt Kenya leader. He said it was unfortunate that a section of leaders were branding the President a tribal leader. Ruto noted that Uhuru was elected by Kenyans from every part of the country to be a symbol of national unity. “If you say President Kenyatta is the leader of this (Central) region, then who is our leader?” he posed. Speaking during the burial of Thika MP Patrick Wainaina's mother in Mang'u, Kiambu County,  Ruto said he has never considered himself as a the leader of Rift Valley but a servant of all Kenyans. He asked leaders to shun tribal politics and serve Kenyans irrespective of their ethnicity. "When we plan for the country's development? let us plan for every single Kenyan," he said. The Deputy President asked leaders to team up and work towards a peaceful, prosperous and united country. “We cannot allow the country to go back to the politics of tribalism; we want to work together and move the country forward.” Present were Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, MPs Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Anne Wanjiku (Gatundu South, Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), Kimani Ichung'wa (Kikuyu), Jude Njomo (Kiambu town) and Jonah Mburu (Lari). Others were Martha Wangari (Gilgil), Sabina Chege (Murang'a County), Kanini Kega (Kieni), Gichimu Githinji (Gichugu), Nganga Kinga'ra (Ruiru) and Githua Wamacukuru (Kabete).
