Usaid has donated mosquito nets worth Sh175 million to the County Government of Busia. The donation, consisting of 600,000 nets, was delivered at the Busia County Referral Hospital by the Usaid/Kemsa medical commodities programme team and received by Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi. Mulomi appreciated the support provided to residents of Busia, adding that the nets will be distributed to the intended persons. He was accompanied by chief officer, public health, Jonathan Ino; preventive and promotive director Dr Melsah Lutomia and Busia malaria coordinator Dr Oluoch Onyango. Mulomi noted that there’s a malaria mortality rate of two per cent and a prevalence rate of 26 per cent in the county. He said measures are being put in place jointly with other partners to improve the usage of nets and to address misuse where some residents have resorted to using them in taking care of vegetable gardens, besides collecting ants. “The objective is to ensure those who get mosquito nets including expectant mothers put them into proper use, to help prevent malaria which remains a killer disease,” said the DG. He challenged residents to observe the preventive measures among them maintaining high standards of cleanliness to control malaria. The Usaid/Kemsa medical commodities program team leader Dr Peter Mwangi said Busia, being an endemic zone, needs to channel more efforts towards the control of malaria. “Now that we have delivered the nets from the national level, there will be mass distribution to all households in Busia County to ensure everyone sleeps under the net for purposes of achieving that protection,” he said. Over 180,000 households in the seven sub-counties of County are set to benefit from the donation, distributed in 34 centers.
