Zetech University Sparks coach Maurice Obilo plans to work on the team’s physical and mental toughness once the Kenya Basketball Federation league resumes. The tactician, who is targeting a top-three finish in the women’s Premier League, remains convinced that this is the only missing part of the puzzle. “Individually, the team is good. What I will focus on once we resume action is the physical and mental toughness,” he said. “We had played two matches and my observation was that they were good at some point but were doing badly in the two aspects of the game.” Zetech succumbed 69-55 to Kenya Ports Authority in their season opener but recovered to pip University of Nairobi Dynamites 40-37. Obilo said they learnt a lot from the two matches and was already working on their weaknesses before sports activities were halted by President Uhuru Kenyatta in a move aimed at curbing the spread of coronavirus. He revealed that he follows his players every day and provides online training to keep them in focus especially on defence. He attributed the defeat to a few mistakes that will be sorted out as the team trains for their coming games. “Since this was only our early games, I got to know what to correct going forward. We learnt a lot and will gradually pick up,” he said. He said the team’s endurance was wanting especially in the last quarters and that is the main reason they lost the KPA duel.
