Outgoing Kenya 2WD navigators champion Wayne Fernandes says it will be nice to feel the Safari Rally route and the pace in a setting that will host the world rally teams. "What I've noted in the past is that the route always has something new, thanks to our weather here in Kenya. "We have done Soysambu at least four times in the past 3 years and it always provides a  different thing along the way—be it a new mud hole, a tree stump, or a hairpin. "So yes, I'm sure between ARC and WRC, there will be something new along the way. "The uniqueness and toughness of Kenyan routes also add a little zest to the Equator Rally," Fernandes said. KMSF Chairman and Safari Rally CEO Phineas Kimathi said: "The route for Equator Rally is both scenic and very challenging. The idea of the Safari is to live our long-term reputation of being the toughest rally in the world. The Equator will act as a dry run for the Safari and will give officials an opportunity to assess their preparedness well in time." The first run on Saturday will be the  14.67km  Elementaita stage, which is using tracks from the old Safari Rally expansive Soysambu Conservancy on the Delamere Estate. Soysambu is a 20.33km stage while Sleeping Warrior ( 30.98km) is the longest run on Saturday. The stage is located in the shadow of a hill that resembles a Masai Sleeping Warrior and criss-crosses the natural plain before a rocky finish. ARC Equator Rally Kenya has Safari Rally's long-standing reputation of toughness and will serve as a precursor to Safari Rally in June. The event was flagged off on Friday by Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed at Kenya Wildlife Institute grounds in Naivasha town after an early morning free practice, Qualifying Stage, and shakedown at Loldia.
