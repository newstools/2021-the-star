Members of the Kenya Railways Retirement Pension Scheme are now appealing to President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene over delayed compensation. Almost five years ago, the pensioners their land was acquired for the construction of the Nairobi Expressway. In a letter released this week but dated March 18, 2021, Kenya Railway Workers Association Nairobi secretary Joab Kidaha says the delay was occasioned by the unavailability of a certificate of search for the land that had yet to be given. “The first instalment of the Sh1.2 billion had been released on February 23, 2021. However, the funds cannot be released by the National Land Commission as the Ministry of Lands has not provided the certificate of search for the piece of land,” he said. The association further explained that the pensioners needed the funds urgently for medical purposes, adding that most of them were elderly and required the money. "We have been visiting these offices. They have been taking us in circles. What he has been telling us is that there is an important document that needs to be perused and finally signed, but it seems there is a shirking of duties of sorts ostensibly to frustrate us," Kidaha said. Some of the pensioners receive Sh3,000 monthly, which, by local standards, is a measly sum. Some get Sh45,000. During a meeting with the Senate Labour and Social Welfare committee early this month, NLC chairman Gershom Otachi said the commission had finalised all plans to ensure the pensioners have their money. “We have been in this matter for some time now, but we are happy to see that we are making some progress. As we have agreed, by tomorrow, we expect that NLC will start to pay Sh1.2 billion,” Otachi said. In September last year, traders within Nairobi Railways Club premises witnessed their business structures flattened. The demolitions were to pave the way for the expressway project.
