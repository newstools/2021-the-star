The past few weeks have served a cocktail of emotions for Kenyan sprint sensation, Ferdinand Omanyala. From the highs of running the fastest time by a Kenyan over 100m (10.01) to Athletics Kenya refusing to recognise his efforts in Nigeria as a national record, Omanyala has gone through an emotional roller-coaster. Yesterday, it was the sprinter’s time to smile again as betting firm Odibets chipped in with a Sh1.5 million motivational cheque as he continues his preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics rescheduled for July. “I feel good that Odibets came in to support me. It gives me hope for a brighter future,” said Omanyala, while disclosing that the deal with the betting firm was not a formal one yet. “It's like a gesture of support.  Supporting talent at all levels.” The AK rejected Omanyala's 10.01  record after receiving a letter from the Director-General of Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) claiming that the 3rd MoC Grand Prix held on March 30 and 31 was not sanctioned by the Athletics Federation of Nigeria. However, the organisers of Making of Champions Relays, in a statement, said they have been in partnership with the AFN since the first edition of the event in 2018. “All the results from every edition of the MoC Grand Prix, including the third edition on  30th–31st March 2021, were valid and legitimate, and it can easily be verified online that all the results have long since been ratified by World Athletics." "Within Nigeria, only the AFN can ratify and send results to World Athletics, which has clearly been the case with the MoC  Grand Prix. AFN has not suddenly ‘un-sanctioned’ the MoC Grand Prix,” the MoC organisers states.
