Evans Karani, a suspect in the murder of Catherine Nyokabi, will be detained for 14 days to allow police to finish their investigations. He was on Monday virtually presented in a Thika court where magistrate Oscar Wanyaga allowed police to detain him at Juja Police Station. The suspect asked the magistrate to expedite his sentencing. The case will come up for mention on May 3. Karani was arrested on April 16 after the body of his estranged lover was discovered 50 metres from his car in the Ndarugu area of Juja, Kiambu county. Police believe the woman was killed on April 14. Detectives believe his Karani's car was stuck in the mud when he dumped the body, forcing him to abandon it at the scene. He was arrested at Githurai Kimbo after locals alerted police. Police searched his car and found weapons that are believed to have been used in the murder. He told police he loved the woman and could not allow her to see someone else. Nyokabi had gone to meet him for reconciliation talks before the event turned tragic. Her family is seeking justice for her death. Her father, Gitonga Njogu, said Karani was well known to the family and that the two had been in a relationship for two years. “He had come to our home on several occasions but we didn’t know he was married to a different woman and had five children,” Njogu said. He said the issue came out two weeks ago, after which the family disapproved of the relationship. This prompted the failed reconciliation talks. Njogu suspects Karani was angry after learning Nyokabi planned to move on with her life. Authorities said the suspect confessed to killing Nyokabi, a hotel worker in Kahawa Wendani, following a bitter conflict, which they had been embroiled in for the past two weeks.
