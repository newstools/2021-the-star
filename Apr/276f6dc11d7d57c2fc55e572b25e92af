Youthful KCB defender Brian Wepo believes time is on his side to follow in the footsteps of teammates Nahashon Alemba and goalkeeper Joseph Okoth as he seeks to become a Harambee Stars regular. Defender Alemba featured in the 2-1 away win against the Sparrow Hawks, earning his first international cap while Okoth was an unused sub. "God's time is the best so I always work hard to be ready and I believe my time will come," remarked Wepo. Though the FKF Premier League season was suspended following a government directive, Wepo revealed he is not resting on the laurels despite the football season being in limbo. "Football  is my job. I do eat, pay rent, save some money and help my family. It is therefore a must for me to train daily to remain fit," said the right-back. The bankers remain among the strong contenders for this year's Premier League title and Wepo disclosed that coach Zedekiah Otieno and his technical bench are not leaving anything to chance even with team training sessions suspended. Wepo reckons that the suspension will affect all teams involved. "I can say maybe the suspension may affect everyone but as a team, we all know what is happening so our technical bench usually make sure every week we do something to better our fitness," he said. With a game in hand, the bankers have 30 points from 15 matches—six less than league leaders Tusker.
