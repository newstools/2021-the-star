Nairobi City Stars head coach Sanjin Alagic is back in the country and ready to continue with his club's push for a strong finish on their return to the Premier League. Alagic left the country in late March for a scheduled week-long rest and recuperation. He was, however, focused to extend his stay after sports in the country were suspended following a spike in the Covid-19 situation. “Following the recent vaccination process on Premier League players, I was hoping to return to prepare the team for immediate league resumption,” Alagic said. “But I am informed that the game is still suspended and we can’t even assemble for training. That’s a little strange but we can't do much but wait for things to normalise,” he added. City Stars sit 10th on the log with 20 points and any lingering fears of being dragged into a relegation scrap have been erased with each passing match day. With no end in sight to the global pandemic and a swift return to normalcy, Alajic compared the situation back home and in Kenya. “Bosnia is also under lockdown due to a rise in coronavirus cases. However, sports have not been affected and the league is still on. It is, therefore, my hope that, just like Bosnia, our league will resume in due course,” he said.
