Wazito head coach Francis Kimanzi says he believes his players possess the capacity and the required mental maturity to train on their own without being monitored. Unlike at other clubs where players have been placed on individual training programs, Kimanzi said Wazito players have been left to design their own sessions. “I know many teams have resorted to individual training programs, but just how effective are they? Personally, I don’t think they bring out the desired results,” said Kimanzi. “I believe my players understand quite clearly what is required of them and they know we expect them to perform and as such, I don’t think they would decide to sit on their laurels.” The 44-year-old tactician, who penned a deal with the Moneybags at the beginning of the season, said he is not yet in a position to determine if he is actually on the way to achieving his objectives given he has only been in charge for a short time. “We had set our objectives at the beginning of the season but it’s still too early to appraise my performance as a coach. I have only been in charge of a few matches to date,” said Kimanzi. He has transformed the side to a winning team since their opening 4-0 defeat to Kariobangi Sharks at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Kimanzi said he still doesn’t know when he’ll be reassembling his charges following the government’s decision to stop sporting activities almost a month ago. “We tried to find out if we will be resuming action soon but we were told we might still have to wait a little bit longer because there is still a second round of (Covid-19) vaccination coming,” he said. Wazito are currently sixth on the FKF-PL log with 26 points.
