A man has been freed by a court after he was accused of stealing a phone worth Sh5500 in Kawangware on April 10. Christopher David narrated to the court on Tuesday that he had bought the said phone from a friend. Speaking before senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki, David said after buying the phone he realised there was a contact on it. It is at this point that David tried to call the number to inquire more about it. According to the charge sheet, David traced the owner on social media and asked him to go and pick his phone. Instead, the owner came for his phone in the company police who arrested the suspect. He pleaded with court to forgive him saying that the complainant was ready to withdraw the case. Magistrate Mwaniki gave him a free bond.
