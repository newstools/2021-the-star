Kanu officials in Homa Bay and Migori counties have urged residents to support the party and restore its lost glory now enjoyed by ODM. Nyanza is considered ODM leader Raila Odinga's turf but Kanu has launched a national popularisation drive. Officials said Kanu was started with contributions from prominent leaders from Nyanza, notably Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and Tom Mboya. Kanu executive in charge of South Nyanza Onam Ogada and Karachuonyo youth leader Elvis Ochieng said the party has become vibrant again. They called on people who left it for other parties to return. “Kanu was started by our great sons from this region. There is no reason why residents should shy away from joining Kanu and I urge them to come back," Otieno said. Ogada said they are committed to strengthening Kanu in Nyanza. The politicians nominated the party co-coordinator in Nyanza Tom Ojanga to be the first vice chairman of Kanu. Ojanga replaces former Kura MP Shadrack Manga who was buried last week. Addressing journalists in Homa Bay town Saturday, Ogada said electing Ojanga will increase Kanu's vigour. Ochieng’ said joining Kanu should not be perceived as rebellion against any political leader in Nyanza, a reference to Raila. “Let our people join Kanu because it is our original political party. All prominent politicians  trace their roots to Kanu," Ochieng’ said. Ojanga is expected to compete with candidates from other counties. Kanu used to have prominent politicians in the region such as former Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno, Okiki Amayo and Akech Chieng’ in the 1990s. Otieno defected to ODM. (Edited by V. Graham)
