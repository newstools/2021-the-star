The Council of Governors has received a boost in its push to have the National Treasury release more than Sh85.2 billion for the months of January, February March and April. Governors say they have been facing many problems in their efforts to take care of Covid patients and the hospitals to which they are admitted. And weighing in on the issue, Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi on Tuesday urged the Treasury to have a "human heart" and consider that the county governments serve many people in need of devolved services. Wamatangi praised the counties for remaining firm and continuing to serve Kenyans despite their financial crises. “The county governments have been working so hard. None has neglected its duties because there is no money, but we should know they are facing challenges and the Treasury must come in and release the funds,” he said. Speaking last Friday, Kiambu Governor James Nyoro said their debts were still increasing as no service had been stopped. Nyoro said the Treasury owes his county more than Sh2 billion and the money should be disbursed as they have to pay workers and buy medicines and medical  equipment. “We have a very hardworking team of health workers whom we have not paid since January simply because our money is lying somewhere in the Treasury” the county chief said. Nyoro said if the debts continue to rise, the county could suffer more as it handles cases of Covid-19. “We are not alone, nearly all counties in this country are having this challenge,” he said. Wamatangi said senators will continue with their oversight role to ensure the funds released to the counties are spent well, not misappropriated. The Majority chief whip said they will follow up on expenditures.
