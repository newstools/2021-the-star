ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi should work with ODM leader Raila Odinga if he wants to become the President, Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi has said. He said the One Kenya Alliance cannot propel ANC leader Mudavadi to the country's top seat. The deputy governor told the Star on the phone that Mudavadi being in One Kenya Alliance is a waste of time. The alliance brings together Mudavadi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetang'ula of Ford Kenya and Gideon Moi of Kanu. Saisi said Mudavadi would be safer in a coalition with ODM, which is more vibrant and has a national outlook that could easily market him for the top seat. “Ford Kenya is only known in Bungoma and Trans Nzoia, Wiper and Kanu are in the same group,” Saisi said. “Gideon Moi was not able to deliver for BBI in Baringo, how he will deliver for Musalia to become the president?” Saisi said Wetang’ula’s party is under siege over the leadership squabbles. Saisi further said Wiper is competing with Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu Narc and Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua's Maendeleo Chap Chap for Ukambani votes. “With all those parties, Kalonzo will have nothing to deliver for Mudavadi,” he said. Earlier, ANC nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi had said ANC should nationalise the party. “ANC must have what we call grassroots elections countrywide to strengthen the party and be ready for new ideologies,” he said.
