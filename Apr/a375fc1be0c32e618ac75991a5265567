Harambee Stars climbed two places up to place 102 in the latest Fifa rankings released on Thursday. The development comes a fortnight after their emphatic 2-0 away win over Togo and a satisfactory one-all draw against Egypt during their African Cup of Nations qualifiers in Lome and Nairobi respectively. Stars also put up an impressive display in their international friendly matches against Tanzania and South Sudan whom they beat 2-1 and 1-0 respectively, although the results bore no relevance to the rankings. Continentally, Kenya is ranked 15th whereas only Uganda (84th) are the only better-ranked team than the local lads. Rwanda, another one of Kenya's Group 'E' rivals in the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers,  are ranked  129th. Senegal, who maintained an unbeaten run in the qualifiers, are the best-ranked African nation followed by Tunisia, Nigeria, Algeria, and Morocco, in that order. Belgium have maintained the bragging rights as the world's finest with France, Brazil, England and Portugal wrapping up the top five slots. Mozambique experienced the biggest slump in the rankings that saw them drop 11 places to 117th. Guinea-Bissau are the most improved nation having scaled 11 places to 108th while Denmark have made a grand return to the top ten.
