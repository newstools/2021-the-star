Hip hop artiste Erick Kinuthia, alias 1Chain, says Juliana's music inspired him musically. 1Chain started singing back in high school in music events, where he mostly ventured into rap and hip hop music. He has done 'Chorea' featuring Alko de Bragar, and a remix of Sauti Sol's 'Suzanna'. The biggest challenges he has faced as an upcoming artiste are finances and marketing of his songs. However, he is hopeful of making it in the industry. "I am eyeing some big collabos now that I'm done with school and I can concentrate on music," he told Word Is. "My wish is to work with singer Nadia Mukami and Darassa from Tanzania. I like how they compose and deliver their lyrics, it is always magical."
