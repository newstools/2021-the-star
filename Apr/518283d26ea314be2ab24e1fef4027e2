The late Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso's son Marco was Team Forward's presidential candidate for the Daystar University Student Council. He won after garnering delegates' 33 votes against his opponent, who got two votes. Speaking to Word Is, Marco said what set him apart is that he had a strong manifesto and went on the ground for his campaign. "Coming from a well-known family made me get a lot of criticism," he said. "I have even been labelled a dynasty and told that I do not understand the hardship students go through." He had to plead with them and they eventually accepted him after showing that he could work. Though widely known as the son of Laboso, the late governor just adopted him and his sister Mina from her late sister Lorna, who died in a plane crash. "As a leader, Governor Laboso was someone who had high integrity, and that is something I want to use even in my leadership," Marco said.
