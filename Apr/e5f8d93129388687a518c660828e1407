The Kenya Editors Guild has organised safety training for journalists in Africa amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In a statement on Tuesday, President Churchill Otieno said the aim of the training is to equip journalists with tools to enable quality accessible information on Covid-19. "...and to sensitize them on importance of verification and checking of facts before posting and to sensitise journalists on safety guidelines and mechanisms with good practices for covering Covid-19," he said. The Editorsâ€™ Guild will do this in collaboration with Unesco. The training will also center on reporting on Covid-19 vaccine and what journalists should know. "The expected outcome is that journalists will have the capacity to address disinformation on COVID- 19, while government will benefit through fostering media relations in public interests," Otieno said. The discussion will be held virtually on April 14,15 and 16 ,19 from 8am. (EastAfrica Time). The virtual training will be attended by journalists drawn from various media associations, media houses across the country, including freelancers.
