Two men and a woman died in the wee hours of Sunday morning following a road accident involving two trailers along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road. One truck driver died on the spot while the other two victims were confirmed dead on arrival at Naivasha subcounty hospital. Two other people were seriously injured. A witness said the driver of the trailer heading towards Naivasha was trying to overtake a fleet of vehicles when it rammed onto an oncoming truck. Joseph Njoroge who was at the scene said four victims of the accident were rushed to various hospitals. The accident caused a major traffic snarl-up along the busy road before police towed away the wrecks. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said the bodies had been taken to the mortuary while the wrecks were at Mai Mahiu police station. “Initial investigations indicate that the overtaking trailer caused the accident and our traffic officers have opened an inquest file,” he said. Meanwhile, police in Naivasha have recovered the body of an unidentified man that was dumped off the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road. “Our officers have collected fingerprints as part of the process of identifying it,” Waweru said.
