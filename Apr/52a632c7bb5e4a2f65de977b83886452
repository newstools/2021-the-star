General service Unit came from a set down to beat Nigeria Customs 3-1 and claim their first win at the African Club Championship in Tunisia this afternoon. The paramilitary side recovered from a 23-25 first-set loss to win the next three 25-16, 25-22, 25-18. The former champions had lost their opening match 3-0 on Sunday against Zamalek, putting pressure on coach Gideon Tarus, before bouncing back in style. GSU will play Rwanda's Espoir tomorrow in the last match of Pool 'D', a match that will determine if they will move into the quarter finals slated for Thursday and Friday. Nigeria Customs, on the other hand, tackle Zamalek. Meanwhile, six-time African champions Kenya Pipeline held their first training session on Monday at Tarzaka Indoor Arena as the women's version serves off on Wednesday in Kelibia. The draw for the ladies will be held tomorrow. The oil merchants are keen to end their 16-year wait for the elusive title they last won in 2005. The Paul Gitau-tutored side have been runners up eight times and finished third in 2019.
