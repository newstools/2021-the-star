A man has been charged with working as an engineer without a valid licence. Ferdinand Wamalwa, 36, is alleged to have passed himself off as the director of Starlem International Limited and as a registered engineer. According to the police report, he signed a tender contract between Starlem International Limited and Kamuriai Secondary School on February 18, 2018. On February 14, 2021, Wamalwa is said to have written to the school accepting the tender and proposed supply of labour for the construction. He was paid Sh500,000 to start the construction, which was to cost Sh700,000 As construction was ongoing the real owner of Starlem International Limited, Levi Okubasu, got information that his company had won a tender in the said school. He reported the matter to the DCI, who wrote to the Engineers Board of Kenya to find out whether Wamalwa was a registered engineer. They said he is not registered with them. Wamalwa, who was presented in court on Thursday, denied the charges before Milimani senior resident magistrate David Ndungi and was released on Sh100,000 bail or Sh400,000 bond. The case will be mentioned after two weeks.
