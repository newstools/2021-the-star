The Media Council of Kenya has criticised DCI boss George Kinoti following his statement hitting out at Citizen TV for its expose detailing how police hire out guns to criminals. In a statement on Tuesday, MCK said," While the council recoginises the role of the DCI, it expects that the process is geared towards investigating the matter and not violating freedom of expression, press freedom and access to information as provided for in the Constitution." Kinoti earlier held a live demonstration broadcast on TV in a bid to save his neck after an exposé showing how rogue officers hire out guns to criminals. The top cop dismissed reports that the police hire guns out to criminals, adding that none of the firearms shown in the exposé belong to the Kenya police. A Citizen TV exposé revealed how rogue police officers promote crime by hiring out their police operating gears: guns, uniforms, bulletproof vests, and handcuffs to criminals for as low as Sh1,000. The exposé caused an uproar. “The allegations are extremely serious. We shall be asking the editorial director, and other relevant reporters to come and give us more insights to this report in pursuit of criminals harbouring the weapons,” Kinoti said. "The report seemed to be a malicious attempt to discredit the National Police Service; we can only conclude that it was aimed at creating public pandemonium over the management of the security sector." Kinoti said the entire story says it was the police who were culpable.
