Charismatic Harambee Stars centre back Joash Onyango is the new darling of Simba SC fans after stealing their hearts with his exceptional exploits on the pitch in the month of March. The Tanzanian Premiership club confirmed this morning that the 26-year-old, who joined them from Kenyan champions Gor Mahia, had scooped the highest number of votes in the race for the Emirates Aluminium Simba Fans Player of the Month for March award. Onyango garnered a whopping 20,288 (79 per cent) of the total 25,719 votes cast. His closest rival Aishi Manula came a distant second with 4, 673 votes (18 per cent) while Luis Miquissone gleaned a paltry 758 (two per cent). Onyango is set to take home a TSh1,000,000 (Sh46,000) in prize money. Contestants are usually picked through a robust selection process that involves five players identified by the club's board before they are shortlisted to three finalists who are subjected to a popular online voteÂ by the fans. He dethrones Mozambique international Miquissone, who bagged the maiden edition in February. Onyango is back in Tanzania after turning out for Harambee Stars in their African Cup of Nations qualifier against Egypt that ended in a one-all draw at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. He was conspicuously absent though when Kenya beat Togo 2-0 in Lome last Monday after the Togolese federation Covid-19 report indicated he had tested positive.
