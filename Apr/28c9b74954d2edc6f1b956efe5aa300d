Vera Sidika has warned women to stop dating married men, saying it slows down one's progress in life. During a Q&A session with her followers on Instagram, a fan asked her what she can do to stop seeing her lover, who's married. The fan wrote, "I'm someone's side chick. I like him so much and I find it hard to leave him." Responding to the fan, Vera told her despite her fear of losing him, the man wasn't afraid to because he will always have as many women as he can. "Then you'll forever be a side chick. Once a man can eat his cake and have it, he doesn't need to try so hard. Even when he breaks up with his girlfriend, he will most likely start dating someone else as you remain a side chick. This is because he already has you and is not afraid of losing you."
