The international friendly match between Harambee Starlets and Copper Queens of Zambia earlier scheduled for April 24 in Lusaka has now been called off. Confirming the new development on Sunday, Football Kenya Federation attributed the decision to the Covid-19 pandemic. "Due to the rising cases of Covid-19 cases worldwide, both federations reached a decision to postpone the match," said an FKF spokesperson. Both teams were keen on using the match to gauge their level of preparedness ahead of crucial international assignments. The Copper Queens will be the only African representatives at the forthcoming Tokyo Olympics and the Zambian Football Association had indicated the game would form part of their preparation for the games. Starlets were supposed to pitch camp last week under the newly appointed coach Charles Okere after Football Kenya Federation dispatched letters to local clubs requesting them to release the selected players. The plans were, however, dealt a major blow following the government's decision to halt all sporting activities in the country in a move aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
