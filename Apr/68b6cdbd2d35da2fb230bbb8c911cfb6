Minti Motorsport's Carl ‘Flash’ Tundo holds the overnight lead after an energy-sapping first day on the Africa Rally Championship (ARC) Equator Rally. Tundo was peerless on the day's run, winning all the six stages to close Day One on a cumulative total of 1:39:14.4 hours. The five-time Safari Rally winner has a comfortable 7:15.1 minutes lead over compatriot Tejveer Rai going into the last day stages at Malewa, Kedong, and Loldia. “We took it fairly easy in the second loop when we saw Boldy (Baldev Chager) and Onkar (Rai) out. The last 5-km of Sleeping Warrior was a Rhino Charge rather than rallying. But at the end of the day, we came through clean. We have done Day 1 and we await a fresh challenge on Day 2 tomorrow (Sunday),” said Tundo. Tundo was happy with the handling of his new VW Polo R5, saying he is looking forward to running it on WRC Safari Rally in June. “The new car (VW Polo) is all good. I’m driving it to my ability but the car definitely has more and it's certainly better than the Evo 10 as it’s a purpose-built rally car and state-of-the-art machine. The Mitsubishi is a road car.” The day’s action claimed a number of frontrunners including Baldev Chager, Onkar Rai, Karan Patel, Ugandan duo Duncan Mubiru, Ronald Ssebuguzi, and Jas Mangat. Other casualties were Waita Nzioka, Isa Amwari, John Nganga, Ugandan Rajiv Ruparelia, Amaanraj, and Peiro Canobbio. Ian Duncan was also a casualty of the day but will rejoin the event tomorrow on the Super Rally rule. The opening day consisted of two passes through Lake Elmenteita whose shores host zebras, gazelles, warthogs, and diverse species of birds.  LEG 1 RESULTS-SATURDAY 1.
