Police in Kongoni Naivasha are investigating the hacking to death of an 18-year-old girl by unknown persons. The teenager's mutilated body was found in her house in Kosovo village, which has recorded cases of murder and violent robberies. Some residents accused the boyfriend of the crime as police moved in to collect the body. Neighbour Joseph Kamau said she may have been killed at night during a heavy downpour in the village that borders Eburru forest. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said the body had been collected and an inquest file opened. Meanwhile, operations at Naivasha Medium Prison were disrupted after a junior officer shot at his senior and seriously injured him. The constable shot the corporal on the shoulder after a disagreement on deployment before he was disarmed by fellow officers. Warders and inmates in the prison that also hosts female prisoners scampered for safety during the morning incident. The victim who was bleeding profusely was rushed to Naivasha subcounty hospital as the suspect was whisked to Naivasha police station. A source at the prison said that trouble started the previous day after the suspect was accused of leaving his work station without permission. And as they collected their arms ready for the day's shift on Monday, the officer using his G3 rifle shot the corporal on the shoulder. “The suspect went to where the victim was lying and warned that he would kill him next time before he was disarmed by fellow officers and taken to the police station,” the source said. Waweru said the suspect was in custody and would be charged in court on Tuesday. “The officer who was shot on the upper arm is recuperating at the subcounty hospital while the suspect has recorded a statement awaiting to be charged in court,” he said.
