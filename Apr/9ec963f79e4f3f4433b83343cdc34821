Prime Bank has expanded its local network by venturing into the North Rift region with the opening of a branch in Kitale town, Trans Nzoia County. The new outlet is located in the robust Mount Elgon Road at the Khetia Supermarket Gigamart. As part of the lender’s local expansion plan, the move aims to increase the bank’s customer base in the farming and agribusiness sectors by tapping into the country's breadbasket, management has said. Prime Bank managing director Bharat Jani said the bank has embarked on an elaborate programme to support farming and agribusiness sectors through tailor-made products and services complemented with a well-covered network of branches. “The opening of the branch in Kitale is a clear indication that our programme to support farming and agri-businesses sectors in value chain is on course since agriculture accounts for over 50 per cent of the Kenyan economy,” Jani said. The bank’s Director of Business Development Vijay Kantaria said despite the current Covid – 19 pandemic, the lender remains resilient and on course in its expansion plan. "The new branch takes us closer to our farmer and all agribusiness customers in the Kitale area, complemented by the ongoing digitization of our services to put the bank in every customer's hand," Kantaria said. The new branch will complement the already existing branch in Uasin Gishu County, Eldoret town. Prime Bank prides itself as being one of the leading private banks in Kenya, founded in 1992, and currently with a network of 21 branches. The Bank has business interests in other African countries such as Malawi, Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia, and in Zimbabwe where it recently acquired Barclays Bank of Zimbabwe through its associate bank First Capital Bank.
