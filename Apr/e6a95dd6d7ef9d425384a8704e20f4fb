One fine afternoon, I drove into the park from the East gate and then turned down the track that leads to the Eland valley dam. As I drove down, a group of ostrich appeared, so I switched off the vehicle and just watched them. They are the largest birds in the world, and they cannot fly due to size and weight. To compensate for the inability to fly, they can run quite fast and if threatened will turn sharply and twist at full speed. The males look majestic with their black feathers and white undercarriage, while the females are a drab grey, just imagine if women in our world all looked drab, and did not care for fashion? They also regularly swallow stones to help the digestion process. It’s no wonder they can’t fly with that extra weight! The species in the Nairobi park are the southern sub-species with pink/reddish legs, Kenya is also one of the few places where the rarer northern (Somali ostrich) sub-species with its blue legs is also found. Ostriches can grow to be about nine feet tall, and can also weigh up to more than 300lbs on average! They can also withstand not having to drink water for days at a time. This means that they are ideal for withstanding the heat. As well as being the biggest birds on the planet, they naturally lay the biggest eggs! I always enjoy the time of year in the park when the chicks hatch as it is quite a sight to see over twenty small fluffballs following the adults. Unfortunately, the chick mortality is high due to predation, however, a healthy population of more than 150 ostrich live in the Nairobi park. So bring the family and spend the day in the park, go birdwatching, and you will be surprised at how many animals can also be seen if you slow down to the pace of nature.
