Nine people were on Thursday charged before a Nairobi court with demanding Sh300,000 with threats from city lawyer George Kithi. Onyango Jackson Kotato, Fidel Castro Oywaya, Linda Akinyi Ochieng, Virginia Achieng Ouma, Tabitha Mugure Ndegwa and Grace Achieng Onditi among others also faced two counts of creating a disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace. The prosecution alleged that on April 13, 2021 at Kithi and Company Advocates offices, located at Maendeleo House in Nairobi, the accused persons jointly with others not before court demanded cash Sh300,000 from George Kithi with intent to steal. They were also accused of creating a disturbance by shouting, banging tables, threatening to harm, breaking down Kithi's office and shutting down operations of the day while demanding Sh850,000. The nine appeared before Milimani senior principal magistrate Bernard Ochoi and were each released on a bail of Sh200,000 pending the mention of the case on April 21. Meanwhile, in the same court Captain Ondabu Kiage was charged with conspiracy to defraud CIC General Insurance Ltd of Sh209,866. The money was for medical bill settlement in respect to the treatment of an alleged principal member, namely Grace Wanjiku Kinuthia, and her dependent Beatrice Wanjiru Wanjiku. He allegedly fraudulently added them as beneficiaries of the Kenya police Sacco Medical Scheme with CIC Insurance. Kiage is also accused of conspiring to defraud the same insurance firm of Sh93,511 and a further Sh1,430,100 being medical bill settlements in respect to treatment of the alleged members. He denied the charges and was released on a bail of Sh 100,000 pending mention of the case on April 28. Edited by Henry Makori
