Former Citizen TV anchor Janet Mbugua says she invested in three suits and an expensive pair of shoes for her first job as a news anchor. Janet, who was speaking to Azziad on her show 'Shoe Game', said the investment was expensive but paid off in the long run. "One of the first pairs of shoes I ever wore as a news anchor in 2007, was worth Sh11,000. I kept them for a really long time but they served the purpose of news. They were really high heels, good quality and they helped with the posture." Janet added that she was not earning much at the time. "It was a painful experience because I wasn't making that much money, but I had to invest in suits and shoes, three suits and that pair, but I kept them for like three or four years. So it paid off."
