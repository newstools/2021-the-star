Director of Youth Affairs Walter Mong'are Snr, alias Nyambane, says he will vie for the presidency next year. Speaking in an interview with Churchill 'Journey Series' edition, Nyambane, who acted in the famous 'Redycyluss' TV programme, said his dreams are valid. "I used to imitate presidents and you know, you can act something until you become. I think I faked it and I am hopeful to make it some day," he said. "My President understands what is happening on the ground. Elections are coming in 2022 and our President has done what he needed to do within the abilities and the capability he had, so we are coming in in 2022. "We are giving Kenyans another opportunity for them to choose someone else to proceed. At this time, I do not know who is going to be the President, but I can't rule even myself out. Dreams are valid." Speaking about his responsibilities as a Deputy Director in the Youth Programme, Nyambane said he watches out for the young people in the country and also offers an advisory to the President on matters to do with youths. "I ensure that everything that is put out there targeting the young people has the intended impact. It pains to see the desperation that has been created in our youth. In a country where we enjoy relative stability." During the interview, the former comedian said he dropped the stage name 'Nyambane', which he earned from the popular comedy show Redykyulass, after he was appointed Director of Youth Affairs in 2017. "It just reminded me that when God needed to bless Abraham, he changed his name first. It's a blessing and I believe it is God who put me here." His message to young musicians is that they need to think about their trade 20 years from now. "I will always be an ambassador of clean content. What content you are putting out on the digital platforms, remember the Internet never forgets. Twenty years from now, would you be proud of it? The message is: think about the impact you have with your brand." Edited by T Jalio
