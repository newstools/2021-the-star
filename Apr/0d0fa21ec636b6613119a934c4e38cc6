A former Ajab employee captured on camera allegedly torturing a suspected thief has been released on Sh50,000 bail. Swabir Mohammed was charged with assaulting Evans Odhiambo and causing him bodily harm on September 14, 2020, in Shimanzi, Mombasa county. He pleaded not guilty. The prosecution objected to Mohammed's release on bond, terming him a risk to the victim. State counsel Ogega Bosibori told the court the accused is likely to tamper with the witness and compromise him. She said the accused might easily reach out to the victim and pay him out before he testifies in court yet he is the key witness. Bosibori further told the court that the safety of the victim is not guaranteed since he does not have a home. She said the prosecution plans to put Odhiambo on witness protection. But Mohammed said the prosecution's reasons were not sufficient to deny him bail. Mombasa resident magistrate Vincent Adet agreed with the defence. He ordered the case mentioned on April 26 for pre-trial. Mohammed was arrested on Monday after a video of someone torturing another person circulated on social media. He was arraigned on Wednesday and the court gave the police two days to complete investigations The police, through state counsel Alex Gituma, had asked for 14 days. Gituma said the police were yet to identify the victim. He said the police needed more time to search for him and thereafter conduct an identification parade before recording his statement. The prosecutor also told the court that the investigating officers were seeking to establish whether the alleged theft was reported to any police station or if the victim was handed over to any police officers.
