Beatrice Nthenya who was killed over a week ago by her lover will be buried on Saturday as police contemplate charging the suspect with murder. Nthenya, 19, was a KCSE candidate at Kilinyaa Mixed Secondary School in Kitui. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Mbusyani chief Maluki Mumo in whose jurisdiction the killing happened, said the girl will be buried at her parents’ home. According to the police, Nthenya was staying in a rented house at Mbusyani market with other female candidates from where they walked to the exam centre every day until when her boyfriend Michael Nguu Musyoka allegedly murdered her. On Wednesday, the chief said the girl was to be buried on Thursday this week but some logistical issues and undisclosed family reasons pushed the burial to the weekend. At the same time, Kisasi subcounty police commander Micheal Ndonga said on Wednesday that the suspected murderer is recuperating from serious injuries he had inflicted on himself in an attempted suicide. He will be charged with murder and attempted suicide. “The young man is responding well to treatment at the Kitui County Referral Hospital where he is admitted but under police guard. Once he is strong enough and back to his feet, we will immediately charge him,” Ndonga said. Nthenya was allegedly stabbed to death at around 7.30 pm on Monday last week. She lost her life after being stabbed twice with a penknife by her boyfriend following a disagreement. “The candidate succumbed to two stabs in the chest and the neck. The attacker is a student at Wote Technical College in Makueni and both of them hail from Mbusyani location of Kisasi ward in Kitui Rural constituency,” Ndonga said. He said after stabbing Nthenya to death, the assailant attempted to take his own life by stabbing himself two times in the chest and neck. He survived.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
