A 15-year-old minor has been arrested after procuring an abortion in Kabartonjo in Baringo county. DCI director George Kinoti said detectives rescued the foetus from the verge of death after the minor threw it in the toilet. The officers who were acting on a report hastily demolished the pit latrine in a bid to retrieve it. "... only to discover that there were two fetuses immersed in the sludge of human waste," Kinoti said. The infants were rushed to Bartabwa Health Centre in Kabartonjo, where one was declared dead, while the other one was referred to Baringo County Referral Hospital for specialized treatment. The suspect will be processed for her crime. According to the constitution, every person has the right to life and that the life of a person begins at conception. (3) A person shall not be deprived of life intentionally, except to the extent authorised by this Constitution or other written law. (4) Abortion is not permitted unless, in the opinion of a trained health professional, there is need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law. According to WHO, recent evidence has shown that too many women and girls continue to suffer and die due to a lack of access to safe abortion and post-abortion care. Approximately 25 million unsafe abortions took place every year between 2010 and 2014. Between 2015 and 2019, on average, 73.3 million induced (safe and unsafe) abortions occurred worldwide each year. There were 39 induced abortions per 1000 women aged between 15–49 years. 3 out of 4 abortions that occurred in Africa and Latin America were unsafe. The risk of dying from an unsafe abortion was the highest in Africa
