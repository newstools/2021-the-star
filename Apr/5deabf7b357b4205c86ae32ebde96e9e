A clash over a Sh70 million car grant and Sh160 million for personal emoluments has stalled approval of the supplementary budget in Bomet, the Star has established. The supplementary budget was to be tabled in the house a month ago but the contention between MCAs and the executive has slowed down the process. While the ward reps insist on having their funds factored in the budget, the executive has rejected a decision by the assembly to reduce the amount set aside for employee salaries. The MCAs question why personal emoluments are still high yet some of the employees had been relieved of their duties. Budget and Appropriations committee chairperson Haron Kirui dismissed reports of a stalemate as untrue. “As far as I am concerned, we do not have any issue with the executive. The supplementary budget is before my committee and it might be tabled in the floor of the house this or next week,” he said. Kirui said the only bone of contention with the executive was personal emoluments, which he stated were unjustifiable. “What we know is that most of the employees were dismissed when the current administration came in but we are surprised that the county wage bill has ballooned and that is why we are asking the executive to explain to us the bit,” said Kirui. The MCAs went on a retreat to Kisumu last week as they tried to iron out the issue and agree on the contentious points before approving the budget. Reliable sources have confided to the Star that they are yet to arrive at a consensus and that the MCAs were to meet the governor this week. But even as the push and pull between the two arms continues, it is evident that the assembly exhausted has its budgetary allocation. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission recently approved the Sh2 million car grant for each of the MCAs across the 47 counties. Edited by Henry Makori
