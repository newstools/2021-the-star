Water supply to the entire Central Business District has been shut down due to a pipe damage, Nairobi water has said. In a notice on Wednesday, the Water company said the damage of the pipes was done by the Express Way Contractor. "The line has been shut to pave way for repairs. Bear with us as we work to restore supply in the shortest time possible," they said. The ongoing construction of the Sh62 billion Nairobi Expressway which has gained pace has in the past interrupted the water supply in Nairobi. The tunnel alone is being constructed for Sh6.8 billion, the treatment plant at Sh6.5 billion, while the pipeline will cost Sh4.6 billion. The tunnel starts at Ichichi in the Kangema sub-county, runs through Kigumo before joining the Ndaka-ini dam in the Gatanga sub-county. It is projected to channel 140,000 cubic meters of water to the reservoir every day. More to follow
