Police in Homa Bay town have arrested six suspected burglars in connection with the theft of goods from shops. On Wednesday last week, traders complained about losing goods worth Sh12 million in a period of two weeks after their supermarkets and shops were broken into. The goods were stolen from Somali-owned Nusra and Taqwa supermarkets, Dawa Fashion and Baraka Shoe shops in Homa Bay town. And in an operation by Arujo senior chief Bob Lang’o and the police, some of the stolen goods were recovered in Pedo village. They included music systems, woofers, television sets, lamps, Zuku discs, solar battery, a generator and mobile phones. The items were confiscated and taken to the Homa Bay police station. Speaking to journalists in his office, Homa Bay OCPD Sammy Koskey said they arrested three suspects on Wednesday morning who, in turn, led them to his two  accomplices. The suspects, a woman and five men, are aged between 26 and 37. Koskey said the six were being interrogated to help police with more information. They will be arraigned once investigations are completed. “We have not recovered all the goods that were stolen, but our officers are  following up on some crucial leads,” Koskey said. The police boss said they had intensified patrols in the area to prevent a repeat of such incidents. Last week, a number of Somali businessmen led by Mohammed Eden appealed to police to protect their businesses.  They complained that some people were taking advantage of the curfew to break into their outlets and steal goods. -Edited by SKanyara
