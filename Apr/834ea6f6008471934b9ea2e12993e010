West Pokot county targets to plant 3.6 million tree seedlings during this rainy season. The trees will be distributed in all 20 wards of the county. The administration has partnered with Equity Bank and the Kenya Forest Services to distribute seedlings across the county. Governor John Lonyangapuo said that the drive is aimed at increasing forest cover in the region to over 10 per cent. He spoke on Tuesday during tree planting at Kamatira Forest. “I warn those encroaching and destroying government forests to desist from the vice and instead plant trees in their farms to increase forest cover in order to contribute in the conservation of environment and generate income,” he said. Lonyangapuo said university students, farmers and landowners will be given seedlings to plant in school compounds, farms, hilly areas and in government forests. “My government wants to inculcate the culture of tree planting and conservation among our youth and population,” he said. Equity Bank's Kapenguria branch distributed 46,000 tree seedlings that were planted at Kamatira Forest. The governor thanked the bank for supporting residents to improve standards of living through its financial services. Bank branch manager James Biwot asked residents to plant trees to help reduce the effects of soil erosion. Biwot also asked residents to stop engaging in charcoal burning since it had exposed the area to adverse weather changes. Last year, the county planted over 100,000 trees in areas that were affected by landslides.  (edited by o. owino)
