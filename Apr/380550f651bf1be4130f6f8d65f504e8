Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has reiterated that only a maximum of 15 people are allowed in areas of worship for recording purposes within the five counties put under one restricted zone due to high Covid-19 cases. The counties are Nairobi, Kajiado, Kiambu, Machakos, and Nakuru. The restrictions were imposed for an initial 30 days. In-person worship was banned by the Inter-Faith Council on March 26 following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directives to curb the spread of the coronavirus. “Therefore, in the areas where the total restriction has been imposed, we will revert to online worship. This will mean that each faith community will organize to have their worship relayed online for the benefit of the congregants,” the council’s earlier statement read. On Friday, Matiang’i reiterated that a maximum of 15 people are allowed in places of worship "for the purposes of recording live transmission services within the zoned areas with full adherence to the Covid protocols". The CS added that counties outside the disease infected area are allowed to have one-third capacity in house worship with strict adherence to the restrictions issued by the Ministry of Health. The Inter-Faith Council had earlier said services should not exceed one hour for the weekly day of worship as well as daily transmission of services. All other gatherings of worshippers stand suspended.
