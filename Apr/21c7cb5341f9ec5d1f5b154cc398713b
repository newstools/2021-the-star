As Vihiga Queens forward Jentrix Shikangwa prepares to fully focus on football after completing her 'O' Level examinations, coach Alex Alumira has called for caution. Shikangwa has not played consistently in an on and off season due to Covid-19 as she concentrated on her final year at Wiyeta Girls but she's now expected to fight for her spot in the county-sponsored team's star-studded attack. Queens are spoilt for choice in the goal-scoring department with the impressive Tereza Engesha and evergreen Topista Situma shouldering the burden to great effect. Engesha is the current league top scorer with 14 goals, one ahead ofÂ  Mwanahalima Adam who plies her trade with the Cyrus Kanyi-tutored Thika Queens. Wadadia hotshot Ruth Chebungei is third with 12 strikes. "Shikangwa guarantees goals but we have to be patient with her. She's been away for a while and her lack of action means she needs to be slowly integrated into the team. If she gives us her best, it will be a bonus but I don't expect her to hit the ground running immediately," Alumira said. "She gives us a new dimension in attack, which is a plus. But in her absence, our attack has been a bit different but combined to a good effect." In the meantime, Alumira believes newly appointed Harambee Starlets coach Charles Okere has time to assess the players before the next assignment following the cancellation of the friendly match against the Copper Queens of Zambia. Queens had four players in the squad that was to face Zambia. "Okere now has time on his side to assess the players ahead of the upcoming assignment. It may or may not be a complete overhaul of the squad but it all depends on the prerogative of the coach," said Alumira.
