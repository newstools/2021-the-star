Panic has gripped property owners on Migosi estate, Kisumu, after city manager Abala Wanga ordered immediate destruction of buildings on sewer lines. On Wednesday, Wanga issued a notice to the owners of the properties, including business premises and homes, to remove the structures immediately or they be demolished by city authorities at the owners' expense. The notice affects 30 building—some of them multi-storey buildings—occupied mainly by the middle-income earners. In the notice, Abala noted that due to unpredictable weather patterns and the long rains, the city has experienced major flooding challenges on the streets and estates. "One of the major affected estates is Migosi where drainage and sewer networks have completely collapsed," the notice reads. According to Abala, this is due to illegal encroachment on the drainage and sewer land, a situation that has interfered with sewage and water flow. "Exercising the power conferred upon the county government of Kisumu, notice is hereby issued to those with illegal structures in the utility spaces to remove them," it further reads. Kisumu has experienced major drainage challenges even within the CBD each time it rains. On Monday, city authorities, in collaboration with the engineers from Kisumu Urban Project that is carrying out ongoing beautification of the city and the contractor from non-motorised transport, conducted a technical assessment of the storm floods within the CBD. A raft of measures recommended by the team included a directive to the contractor to fast-track completion of drainage works along An'gawa, Oginga Odinga and Kenyatta roads. The contractor was further directed to destroy all the ramps along the affected roads and redesign them to avoid obstruction of storm water along the drainage channels. On the other hand, the city officers were mandated to unblock and open up the drainage.
