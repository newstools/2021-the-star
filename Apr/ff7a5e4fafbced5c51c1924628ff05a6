Kariobangi Sharks and Harambee Stars defender Samuel Olwande is on the recovery path after successfully undergoing an ankle operation at the AIC Kijabe Hospital on Friday. Olwande suffered a torn cartilage in Sharks' opening Football Kenya Federation Premier League encounter against Wazito at Moi Stadium, Kasarani which they won 4-0. The 32-year-old linked up with Sharks in 2019 after a stint with Mathare United. He was handed his maiden senior call-up in the same year following an outstanding season. This is the second time in three years the defender is being rendered inactive by injury. In December 2018, he stayed out of action for five months after undergoing surgery on his right knee to correct a third-degree meniscus tear suffered in October last year. Other than Sharks and Mathare, the towering defender previously played for Oserian Fastac, Chemelil Sugar, and Tusker FC.
