The National Environmental Management Authority has ordered the closure of unlicensed quarries and rehabilitation of abandoned pits in Kwale. The new development comes months after the environment board closed Maweni and a few other mining sites in Ukunda for safety of miners. Nema county director Godfrey Wafula said due to the expected heavy rainy season the unregulated mining activities pose great danger to the miners and residents living around. "The rains have started and there are big holes that are not only an eyesore, but harmful to human life," he said. Wafula said small scale miners have not been adhering to the environmental law causing massive land degradation hence raising safety concerns. The officer said appropriate measures must be first laid down and legal assessment conducted on the quarries before they resume normal operations. The county has had major incidents where many people have lost lives while harvesting sand and stones. The accidents happen most in rainy seasons. Last year in October two people were buried alive and several others badly wounded after a quarry collapsed in Msambweni. A woman also died on the spot while crushing stones at the quarry. Wafula directed mining site owners to ensure quarries are safe. "Those who run the sites, make sure the exhausted ones are refilled and safety be the utmost priority," he said. He said both people's lives and the environment must be protected. However, residents who solely depend on the quarries for livelihood opposed the directive. Many families in Kwale depend on the mines especially those who reside along the Indian Ocean belt. Baraka Faki said Covid-19 has affected jobs and closing the mines amid the economic constraints will cause further suffering. The director, however, warned of stern action against those who will go against the law. He said they also are investigating the licensed ones to ensure compliance. -Edited by SKanyara
