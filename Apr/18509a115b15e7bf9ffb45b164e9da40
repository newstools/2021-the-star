Ugandan comedian Anne Kansiime and her fiancee Skylanta are expecting their firstborn baby. The comedian announced the news on Instagram withÂ a photo of her holding her baby bump. "I have been looking for the perfect way to break it to you my dearest Ninjas that soon, my Kantu @skylantagram and I shall have a little Ninja added on to our family, and I thought and thought, what better way?!!" The couple met in a club. Speaking in a past interview, Skylanta said he met her in a bar and that night, she was buying alcohol. Kansiime said she had come to the club to meet her sister but the sister came with Sky, whom she used to do music with. They have been dating after Kansiime's relationship with ex-husband Gerald Ojok collapsed in mid-2017 amid infidelity claims.
