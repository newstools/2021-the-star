The government has asked residents of Kiambaa constituency in Kiambu county not to be incited by politicians as they warm up to start campaigns for a by-election. Politicians have already started declaring their interest to take over from where former legislator Paul Koinange left after he died of Covid-19 complications two weeks ago. They are waiting for National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to declare the seat vacant and ask the IEBC to conduct a by-election. Area deputy county commissioner Peter Maina on Friday asked the politicians to conduct their campaigns in a peaceful way that will attract voters to listen to them. “We are very alert not to see or witness chaos like the ones we have seen before. We want everyone to control themselves. Let your speeches pull people to listen to you, not cause chaos because we shall be with you,” Maina warned. Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi urged locals to pay attention and listen to all the aspirants so that they can make informed choices. Wamatangi advised locals not to accept to cause chaos since they will suffer the losses, injuries and leave a bad name for aspirants and themselves. “We would not want to hear chaos in Kiambaa that will leave injuries, destruction of property and any other loss,” the senator advised. Speaking on Saturday, Wamatangi urged the leader who will take over to try and finish projects started by Koinange. Aspirant Damaris Waiganjo urged the youths and women to be alert since they are the targeted voters by all aspirants who keep saying they are normally used by politicians to sail through an election. “As we listen to politicians we shall support, let us remember what happened yesterday and put into consideration that there is a tomorrow and we shall need each other. Let us embrace peace,” she said. Edited by Henry Makori
