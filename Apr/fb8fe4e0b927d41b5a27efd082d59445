Landslides in Old Kijabe town and its environs will end once trees planted in Kijabe forest have grown, the Kenya Forest Service says. Whenever it rains, locals move away to safe grounds as landslides and mass soil erosion are experienced. The region has low forest cover after most trees were felled and sold by illegal loggers years ago. Most areas are left bare and earthen materials are easily worn away. On Friday, KFS partnered with the Kenya Defence Forces to plant 25,000 indigenous trees in the sloppy region to fix the problem. Tree roots will hold the soil firmly, thus preventing landslides. Kiambu ecosystem conservator Paul Karanja last Wednesday said the trees will benefit residents, even though the exercise is also part of the initiative to help Kenya achieve 10 per cent forest cover by next year. Karanja said the soldiers involved—who were from Kahawa Barracks—led them and the Community Forest Association in afforesting 200-hectare land. “This area experiences landslides, soil erosion, and once these trees grow, these cases will be controlled,” he said. He was accompanied by Central highlands conservancy conservator Samuel Ihure, Kinale forester Simon Mwema and Kenya Army Lt Col Joseph Yatol. Ihure said a Kijabe forester is in charge of the forest. He urged Kinale CFA members to protect the trees and ensure they mature. “We thank our CFA for working hard in partnership with our officers on the ground to ensure what has been planted has grown. This is very important so that we achieve the 10 per cent forest cover by 2022,” he said.
