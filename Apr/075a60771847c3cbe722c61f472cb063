A civil society group has gone to court to stop the Homa Bay County Public Service Board from hiring law enforcement officers. Interface Community Help Desk says that the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kisumu had barred the board from hiring workers because it is not properly constituted. The board is fully constituted when it has seven members. Currently, the board has four members after some were suspended. The county assembly recommended that Governor Cyprian Awiti suspends the three members for misconduct. ICHD chairman Evans Oloo  and member Michael Kojo said allowing the board to continue with recruitment will be a breach of the court order. The members who were suspended from office said the board is underrepresented and cannot make decision on any matter. Awiti’s administration has never hired law enforcement officers since the inception of devolution. Due to the absence of the officers, Homa Bay has been experiencing low revenue collection. There are also cases where some people collect tax but do not submit to the county treasury. Absence of county askaris has also led to increased cases of vandalism of county property. In 2019, MCAs passed a bill to compel the executive to recruit law enforcement officers. MCAs argued that the government was registering low revenue collection because some individuals who were tasked to do the work disappear with proceeds. The process of recruiting county askaris had begun after the public service board advertised for residents to apply. More than 200 people are expected to be hired in the recruitment. “We are asking residents of Homa Bay not to apply for the opportunities because the board is currently not mandated to undertake the recruitment,” Gor added. In the meantime, the county government has sought the service of some youths who are manning roads to collect revenue from public service motorists. Some of the officers are also collecting revenue from traders in markets. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
