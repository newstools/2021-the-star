The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Council has fined three nursing facilities Sh500,000 each over adverts claiming they could offer home-based ICU care. In the adverts, Apex Home Healthcare, Utunzaji Home and Nursing Care and Wholistic Nursing Care claimed to offer home-based ICU care for Covid-19 patients starting from Sh15,000. According to the Apex advert, the minimum number of days someone can have is 10. This means that if you are to pay Sh15,000 per day for a minimal 10 days, you will pay Sh1,500,000. The poster reads “Shortage of beds in hospitals for Covid patients. Don't panic, we will set up ICU at home” For the institution to set up the ICU facility, they will require ICU beds with flexible mattress, uninterrupted oxygen supply, ventilator and a blood gas analyser. Others include; patient monitor, infusion pumps, a defibrillator and trained critical care staff. But CEO Daniel Yumbya said the institutions are not registered to cater for such sensitive equipment to save lives. “They shall each pay a penalty fine of Sh500,000 each to the Council within 14days from today,” he said. Yumbya said Kenyans should take caution that the adverts are misleading and geared towards obtaining money by false pretence.
