Former Kameme TV presenter Wakarura Manyara is not coming back to the media again after being frustrated by her former bosses. Well known for her family shows at the station, Wakarura, who was speaking in a YouTube interview with 'Metha ya Kagoni', said she would wake up at 3 am and be in the office by 5am. Despite all that effort, she went for close to a year without pay. Her husband noted that she wasn't doing well. He took his laptop, wrote a resignation letter, encouraged her to send it and completely forget about the station. "Whether I was sick or not, I did my best for that show. I mean I had committed to it with all my heart. I remember during my child's birthday, I would celebrate while in the studio. I would even not catch up with some activities at home," she recounted. "In December 2019, before Christmas, there was a lot of hardship and nobody wanted to address it. One day my husband asked me what time the company picks me for work and what I needed from him before I leave the house." Wakarura would ask him for bus fare to come back home and money for lunch. "When it was enough for me, I also wrote on my Facebook account, but my heart was heavy when I left that media company," she said. "I had not been paid for almost a year. They were not even sorry. That made me swear never to go back to TV or ever work in any media house." She is currently working with her husband and also nurturing young couple in marriages.
