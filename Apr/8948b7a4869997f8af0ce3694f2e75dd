I am finally out! ODM party leader Raila has said as he talked of his Covid-19 infection. Speaking when he inspected projects in Nairobi accompanied by the president, Raila praised God for healing him. "Fellow Kenyans, I am out! God is good. Today, I  have had the opportunity to leave my house since I tested positive for Covid-19," he said in a hoarse voice. Standing side by side with President Uhuru Kenyatta, Raila said the disease left him critically ill. "For the past three weeks, I have been in a critical condition. The president called me here so that I can inspect projects with him," he said. "Thank you Uhuru for inviting me to get out, so that Kenyans can see my face. I am happy to see the progress at the Green Park terminus." Raila said the virus has claimed the lives of Kenya's loved ones, frontline soldiers and it is still knocking on our doors. "They doctors put me on some drugs for five days after i checked into the hospital. I then went back and they administered a mixture of drugs..," he said. He also noted that he was put on oxygen for a while when he had breathing difficulties. "I thank God for the healing, my medical team for their diligence and the ceaseless prayers from all of you," he said. "Mama Ida, my children and the larger Odinga family, I owe you! We should not give up! We are not about to give up! We shall overcome! God is faithful." The ODM party leader tested negative for Covid-19 on Wednesday. The party confirmed via Twitter that Raila was now out of danger of the virus and is focused on pending issues. He tested positive for the virus on March 11 when he checked into Nairobi Hospital  for a series of tests after complaining of fatigue when he returned from a grueling five-day tour of the Coast region where he had drummed up support for the Building Bridges Initiative.
