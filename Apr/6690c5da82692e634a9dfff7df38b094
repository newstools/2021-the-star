The Sh3.3 million equipment stolen from Emuhaya hospital on Saturday at dawn was an inside job, Vihiga Health executive Amos Kutwa has said. Some equipment was vandalised. “Though we have some security breaches, how the robbery occurred was totally an inside job,” he told the Star on the phone on Wednesday. He said a number of computers with crucial information were vandalised, including an Ottichilo Care programme computer. Medical genexpert machines and doctors’ computers were also destroyed. He said suspects have been suspended from duty as investigations continue. “My call is for the community to come out and help us flush out such people who vandalise public properties,” Kutwa said.
