Counties have been asked to work with education stakeholders so that performance in schools can be improved. Mining and Petroleum CAS John Mosonik wondered why some learning institutions had continually performed dismally in the national examinations with little being done by the stakeholders to address this. He said with leaders, parents, teachers and other stakeholders being brought on board, issues facing the schools and learners and which affects the performance can be checked and solution sought. Speaking when he monitored the opening and distribution of the ongoing KCSE examination materials at Mogogosiek in Konoin on Wednesday, the CAS cited Bomet as among the counties that have had poor results over the years. “We need to sit down as leaders and key stakeholders and discuss what to  improve on so that our schools can compete with the rest and produce good results. We do not want be sliding backwards each year yet we can find solutions to this problem,” said the CAS. Mosonik who was accompanied by county commissioner Susan Waweru and other education officials, however, expressed optimism that despite the challenges brought about by the coronavirus, candidates will record good results. He said the government has done its bit by ensuring all learners have good learning environments to enable them sit for the national examinations without any hitches and so there was no reason why they should not perform well. The official at the same time urged school heads to deal ruthlessly with indiscipline cases among learners as such, he noted, have contributed to poor results. The examination continued in the county with no hitches being reported so far. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
