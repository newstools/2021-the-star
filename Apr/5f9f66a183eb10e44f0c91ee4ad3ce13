One dead and several injured as an ongoing gate wall collapses in Vihiga, County Police Commander Benjamin Ong’ombe has confirmed to Star via the phone. A source on the ground told the Star that the gate slab went down due to weight. "They were removing shutters in that process due to weight of the slab and the workers on top of it, it carved in," source said. He said the incidence occurred at round 3pm this evening. “Those who were with manner injured were rushed to Mbale referral hospital, they have been treated and allowed to go home,” Ong’ombe said. He said for those who were involved most were workers on the site that is currently under construction. Speaking to CCEM for Health Amos Kutwa and his Chief Officer for Medical services Arnold Mamadi on phone both said they are yet to report on the site. “Please allow me to react on the site first so that when I give the information, I am giving the right information,” Mamadi said on the phone. CCEM Health Amos Kutwa said he will make clear communication while on the site. “Though I'm told it’s the gate wall that has gone down trapping some of the workers there though I am not yet there to confirm that,” he told the Star on the phone. The morgue that was launched by Governor Wilber Ottichilo some months back, was set to be finished by late May. Vihiga Governor, through the department of Communication, has expressed his sincere sorrow and condolence to the family of the deceased and commits to ensuring those injured receive medical attention.
