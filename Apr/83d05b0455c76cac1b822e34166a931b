Kabras RFC captain Dan Sikuta hopes the ongoing  vaccination drive in the sports circles will lead to resumption of activities across the country. Sikuta urged sportspersons countrywide not to rest on their laurels but to keep working on their fitness. “As a team, we were scheduled to receive our vaccines from Malava Sub-County hospital this week but we were made to wait for the restocking of the vaccines. This is a good indicator and pointer to the government’s willingness to open up sports activities again and give us another opportunity to exhibit our skills in the sport we are passionate about. It will also rescue careers of many talented youths," Sikuta said. The skipper said the current lull in sporting activities has not diverted the Enterprise Cup champions from their desire to lift this year's Kenya Cup trophy in which they have a 100 per cent winning record so far. "Our coach has come up with a program that sees five players undergo mandatory physical conditioning in the house and individual jogging  across the road. At the moment, we are not focusing on what other teams are doing but on what will help the team and enable us to settle down very fast once the suspension is lifted," he said. The Mzingaye Nyathi-coached side began their campaign on a high note, racking up huge wins in their first three matches against Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (Mmust), Harlequins and Strathmore University.  Regardless, Sikuta is careful not to pop the champagne yet. “We will continue taking each match as it comes. We know our targets and objectives and want to realise them. This will only be achieved through hard work and discipline among the playing unit.”
