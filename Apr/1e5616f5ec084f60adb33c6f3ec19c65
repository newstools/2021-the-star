ODM party leader Raila Odinga has joined Kenyans in mourning the death of State House Comptroller, Abraham Kiptanui, who passed away early Sunday morning. Raila described Kiptanui as someone who stood out as among the astute, firm, principled, and professional figures. "Abraham Kiptanui stood out as among the astute, firm, principled, and professional figures around former President Moi who helped the country stay on course amid many challenges," Raila said. "My thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time of grief. May His Soul Rest In Eternal Peace," he concluded. The former State House Comptroller passed away in the presence of his family at the Nairobi Hospital following a long illness. Kiptanui had been hospitalised for nearly a month. He served under the late President Moi's tenure and was a powerful figure during that regime. The family has since requested prayers and time to grieve during the period. The family said the funeral arrangements will be announced at a later date. Deputy President eulogised Kiptanui as an illustrious and hardworking public servant. "Abraham Kiptanui, the former Statehouse Comptroller, humbly served the country with dedication. He was a cause-driven and tireless administrator," he said.
