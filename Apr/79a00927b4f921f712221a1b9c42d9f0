Sleuths based in Mombasa have arrested a security guard in Mombasa manning Ajab Unga Factory in Shimanzi for torturing a suspected offender. Swabir Abdulrazaq Mohamed, 33, was captured in a widely circulated video clip torturing the victim for allegedly trespassing into the factory’s premises. The victim, said to be a street urchin who ekes his living through seeking alms in the streets of Mombasa was subjected to untold anguish through burning using the flaming drops of the mosquito net. The victim who was also whipped by the security guard using a plastic pipe is yet to be identified. His hands were tied and neck secured on an electricity pole using a rope, wailed in despair as he begged for mercy, from the visibly happy tormentor. The sleuths said that Abdulrazaq alleges to have handed over the victim to two police officers whom he cannot identify or remember the police stations where they are attached. According to the detectives, such report was not filled in any police station within Mombasa on the material day and that there is no a police station within the victim’s state that would have booked him before he was treated. The victim, whose hands were tied and neck secured on an electricity pole using a rope, wailed in despair as he begged for mercy, from the visibly happy tormentor. The incident happened as curious onlookers milled around appearing helpless, as some recorded the scene using their phones. The sleuths are currently looking for the victim to file his statement. Abdulrazaq will be arraigned on Tuesday to answer to charges of grievous harm, with charges of attempted murder also being considered. The police have lauded members of the public who gave a tip-off on Abdulrazaq whereabouts which led to his arrest.
