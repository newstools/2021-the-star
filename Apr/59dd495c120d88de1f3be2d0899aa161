Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has said the ongoing curfew will run until May 29, 2021. This is both for the disease infected zone and the rest of the country. The infected zones curfew run from 8pm to 4am while the rest of the country from 10pm to 4am. The president in his directives last month did not give a timeline for the curfews only noting that the restrictions will stay in place "until otherwise notified." In the Gazette Notice dated April 12, Matiang'i said the curfew will be in place for 60 days effective March 29, 2021. The initial Legal Notice issued on March 29 had indicated that the 8pm to 4am curfew would run across the country and would be in place for 30 days. Ban on all public gatherings was also extended to May 29 to curb the spread of Covid-19. In the revised Gazette Notice, the CS also included Advocates as among those who were left out in the initial one triggering a lawsuit by the Law Society of Kenya. Also included on the new exemption list are Children protection service providers and operators of safe shelters and safe spaces for sexual and gender-based violence survivors. President Uhuru Kenyatta also revoked all issued curfew passes and exemptions. "This is in light of the abuse of curfew passes and exemptions and its role in the steep increase in infections," Uhuru said. Uhuru further said that all physical/In-person and congregational worship in all places of worship in the Counties of Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and Nakuru stands suspended until otherwise notified. Following the sharp increase in Covid -19 ceases in the country, the President ordered all hospitals to limit the number of visitors for hospitalized patients to two visitors per patient. This comes as hospitals report inadequacy of space for patients and beds for critical cases.
