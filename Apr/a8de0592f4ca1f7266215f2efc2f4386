A clinic manager was charged on Tuesday with stealing Sh1.3 million from a company belonging to two doctors at Kenyatta National Hospital Doctors Plaza. Aisha Jemutai is accused of stealing the money from Gynacare Limited in Kilimani. The money is said to have come to her possession by virtue of her employment. She allegedly committed the offence between January 1, 2019 and February 28, 2021. The complainants, Dr Jane Machira and Dr Maureen Awiti, work at KNH Doctors Plaza and operate the clinic under Gynacare Health. In 2017, they registered a Safaricom line for M-Pesa payments to the clinic and entrusted Jemutai with receiving customer payments. In February 2021, they received a notification that the Sim card had been blacklisted by the Credit Reference Bureau because of non-payment of Mshwari mobile loan though they had never borrowed cash from the platform. They made enquiries from Safaricom and confirmed that the Sim card at the clinic had been used to borrow the loan. They further requested M-Pesa statements from Safaricom and found out that the clinic manager had used funds paid in by their clients. They discovered that more than Sh1 million had been transferred to Jemutai's personal M-Pesa line and Sh1.3 million had been sent to her husband's number and payment at supermarket and restaurants. She denied the charges before chief magistrate Martha Mutuku and was granted  a Sh500,000 bond and alternative Sh300,000 bail. The case will be mentioned on April 27. Meanwhile, in the same court two men were charged with forging a will. Geoffrey Kuria and David Njuge appeared before Mutuku and denied wrongdoing. The court was informed that on August 18, 2011, at unknown place and time within Kenya, they jointly with intent to deceive, forged the will of Esther Njeri purporting it to be a genuine and valid will signed by her. They faced a second charge of making a false document against the law. They were released on Sh200,000 bail each.
