Security officers in Transmara West have arrested a man and recovered an AK-47 and 10 bullets in Mashangwa area, Narok county. This brought to 115 the number of illegal guns recovered in two years in the area. Deputy county commissioner Mohamed Noor said the suspect was arrested after a tip-off from members of the public. “The members of the public informed us that there was a civilian they were suspecting had a gun. Security immediately swung into action and recovered the gun and 10 bullets,” he said. Noor said the suspect is being held at Kilgoris police station and will be taken to court once investigations are complete. The administrator praised residents for cooperating with the police. “We want Transmara West to be a gun-free area so that our people can carry out their businesses without fear of being attacked like it used to a few years ago,” Noor said. In 2018, the security team launched an operation to recover guns in the hands of civilians after 14 people were shot dead in prolonged clashes between the Siria and Uasin Gishu clans. The subcounty security agencies have been holding peace meetings in the affected areas to end hostilities and embrace long-lasting peace. The Siria and Uasin Gishu clans have been fighting over the common Nkararo-Enoretet border. Last Friday, the two communities started to receive the land titles as part of measures to restore peace among them. Also, the government constructed a murram road to act as a buffer zone between the two clans.
