A couple's squabble involving a Kenya Defense Forces Private turned lethal when his 27-year-old wife, armed with her teeth bit him to death. The 37-year-old Private, based at the Gilgil KDF Camp, died in his house at Kahawa Wendani in Kiambu's Ruiru sub-county, when the wifeÂ  cast her teeth through his thumb, chest and shoulder. An argument over an unestablished matter broke out into a major ding-dong at midnight on Sunday before the lady-Violet Asale-resorted to the unlikely weapon that cut short her husband's life. Realizing he had developed convulsions and was sliding into his death, Violet rushed her man to Kahawa Garrison health centre, but it was too late to save him. As the body awaits the autopsy, the woman remains in custody as a suspect of murder. Neighbours at the Makiwanga area of Kahawa Wendani said the deceased was last seen looking distressed and some late night commotion and screaming was heard from their house. The reason for the argument is yet to be established.
