A Kibera court has granted detectives seven days to detain a man linked to a series of break-ins in Nairobi's Kilimani and Kileleshwa estate. Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki ordered Kennedy Otieno Oyier alias 'Spiderman's' detention after police constable Stephen Kibei from Kilimani DCI offices made a successful miscellaneous application. Kibei told the court that the suspect was arrested on April 11 within Nairobi and booked at Kilimani police station. “The suspect was arrested following numerous reports of burglary, house break-ins and stealing within Kilimani , Kileleshwa and Capital Hill and booked at the Kilimani police station,” he told the court. The detective told the court that the suspect was arrested after various complaints were made at the police station. He also told the court that in some incidences, the suspect was captured on CCTV footage. “Preliminary investigations indicate the suspect was a notorious house breaker and who has the habit of terrorizing residents of Kilimani and in some incidences he was captured in CCTV footage,” he added. The detectives told the court that the suspect was arrested in Kawangware area along Kikuyu road. Kibei told the court during his arrest; 10 laptop bags, 20 flash disks, one television set, several motor vehicles parts, metal bars used to break into houses and assorted electronic cables were recovered. “During the time of the arrest one mobile phone which we believe contained important information which will assist in arresting his accomplices was recovered from the suspect,” the detectives told the court.
