Former Harambe Star striker Dennis Oliech has for the first time spoken about why he sold most of his prime properties and apartment. In the past, media reports claimed he was going broke, hence the move. In an interview with Mozzartbet, Oliech explained that he was doing this to treat his mother and late brother Kevin Oliech. “My mother’s hospital bill came to around Sh40 million and we had to pay around Sh84 million for Kevin’s bill. You cannot hold on to an asset and your relatives are ill and need your help.” Oliech says he should have asked for help. “The problem was maybe we did not appeal to the public to help us cushion the financial burdens.” Speaking about his entertainment and events promotion company, Fishborne Entertainment, Oliech recounted how it started and eventually died. “I loved reggae music and I still do. I figured out I could turn out my passion into a business since I had access and connections to high-profile reggae artistes, and that is how Fishborne was founded,” he said. “I paid a lot of money to bring artistes such as Richie Spice, Morgan Heritage among others to perform live in Kenya, but the business never broke even due to lack of sponsors and good partners.” He said back then, reggae music was associated with the ghetto youth and criminals, which was not good for business. But right now, reggae music is played in most entertainment joints daily. "It has become really huge, not just in the ghettos like before. So yeah, it was a brilliant idea, but wrong timing. I wish I did that now. That said, we enjoyed the special moments.”
