The Tax Appeal Tribunal has ordered Ruaraka Diversified Investments Limited to pay Sh672 million incorporation tax arising from the sale of land in 2013 and 2015. The said land was allegedly for the development of the Garden City project. The real estate company had argued that the gain realized on the sale was in the nature of capital gains and that they had written to Kenya Revenue Authority seeking guidance as to whether Capital Gains Tax or Corporation Tax should apply in the subject transaction. The company expected that only capital gains would be charged for the transaction. However, KRA noted that the gain realized from the transfer of land to Garden City Retail limited and Safaricom PLC was realized in the normal course of business operations of the real estate company and that the transaction was for the purpose of making profit, as such the proceeds of the sale of land was subject to Corporation Tax and not Capital Gains Tax. In a statement on Thursday, KRA Commissioner,Â  Legal Services and Board Coordination Paul Mutuku said the Tribunal found that the investment company had made substantive misrepresentations to the Authority when it sought for the private ruling as the transaction was not one-off and the nature of business of the company was developing and selling land hence no legitimate expectation could arise from the ruling. "The Tribunal further found that the action of holding property for a period forthe value to appreciate and thereafter selling with the aim of making profit constituted trade," Mutuku said.
