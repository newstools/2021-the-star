Kenya Sevens play-maker Sammy Oliech faces a race against time to be fit for the Tokyo Olympics after suffering an Achilles injury in Dubai. Oliech had just returned to the side after personal commitments ruled him out of the Madrid Sevens last month and hopes  his injury will heal in good time to make the selection for the Tokyo games in July. Team manager, Eric Ogweno said Oliech sustained the injury while in training and underwent surgery. "He is set to start the rehabilitation process when the team arrives in the country next week. He is disappointed to miss out on Dubai having trained well with the team," added Ogweno. He said Oliech's injury will open opportunities for the likes of Daniel Taabu, Eden Agero and Johnstone Olindi to step up in the position if he doesn't make the team. "We have options for the position and the technical bench will assess the players' form and training,” he added.  Oliech hopes to have recovered from the injury by the time the final pre-Olympic tournament in Los Angeles is played in late June. Elsewhere, Kenya Rugby Union have asked the government to reverse the suspension of sports in the country owing to the surge of Covid-19 cases. The union said they had put up protocols to mitigate against the virus,  including  testing of players and match officials and lack of spectators. The union said rugby being a contact sport, the levels of strength and conditioning take time to attain.  "After the long break, players had just started getting into shape.  With another possibly prolonged break, we will lose all the gains and ultimately be uncompetitive in the upcoming international assignments," said the statement.
