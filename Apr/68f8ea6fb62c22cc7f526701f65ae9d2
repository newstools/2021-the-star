Comedian Eric Omondi says marriage is currently not a priority in his life. Speaking to Word Is, the father of one said he will have more children but he is not keen on settling down with a wife. "My family is my son and my mum, but I will get more kids," he said. "Eric getting his wife and settling down, those things no longer work. All my friends and uncles who were married are all divorced. Something is wrong and I need to carry out research." In a recent interview, Eric had promised to get a wife this year. "My birthday will be on 9th March. I cannot go into 2022 without a wife and a child. The country cannot get a new president and I fail to get a wife, impossible," he said. He now says he is afraid of getting married. "The fact that I am 40 years, it is still not a priority. If you see people who are older than you divorcing or in unhappy marriages, just know there is a problem. I fear a failed marriage. Although I can make it work, I also need to know why for even those I MCed their weddings, most have failed," he said. "I do not want to be a commando and end up in a mess. My parents are even tired of waiting for me to settle down." Eric and Jacque Maribe have a son together, and Eric says he is taking care of him. In the past, Eric had promised to marry his Italian girlfriend Shantal after the public engagement. They dated for close to five years before publicly announcing their break up in 2018. "I knew she was the one, I knew we were going to marry for sure. But things happened and this wasnâ€™t to be. A relationship is a commitment, it needs sacrifices. You have to compromise a lot of things, especially for someone like me and what I do. We tried our best I believe, but maybe the efforts were just not enough."
