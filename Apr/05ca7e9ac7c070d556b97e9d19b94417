A new look awaits eight markets in Nairobi as they are set to be upgraded. The Nairobi Metropolitan Service has embarked on renovations work. The markets include Jericho, Wakulima, Landhies Road, Kariobangi South, Kayole Spine road, Embakasi, Uhuru and Muthurwa Market. NMS director general Mohammed Badi last month revealed that the markets will have different upgrade works. “NMS will upgrade the markets to modern ones and improve on ablution facilities where they lacked,” he said. NMS will also rehabilitate various roads linking to the markets to allow efficient flow of traffic. Badi said various parking spaces in the markets will be upgraded to ensure that there is enough capacity for farmers to deliver their produce. Already, a borehole has been drilled at Toi Market with the water reservoir being under fabrication. Markets with asbestos roofs will be removed and replaced with others. Perimeter walls and security lighting will be installed. It is expected that construction works will be completed next month. Asbestos is a hazardous material with extremely fine fibers and can remain suspended in the air for hours. If handled without caution, it may cause serious chronic health problems such as asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. In a 2017 City Hall report, out of the 43 markets in Nairobi, only 10 had asbestos roofs Residential estates such as Bahati, Kimathi and Ofafa Jericho have asbestos roofs that are used to collect drinking water for the residents. As a result, the members of Nairobi county assembly called upon City Hall to replace asbestos roofing in all residential houses. The MCAs specifically wanted the roofing of houses built in the 1950s and 1960s in Eastlands replaced because of cancer risk associated with asbestos. They claimed the use of asbestos was banned by the national government in 2006, but the order has never been effected. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
