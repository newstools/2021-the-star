KCPE examination results will be out in the next fortnight, Education CS George Magoha said. Magoha announced this on Monday in Kisumu saying they are on the right track with only the marking of Kiswahili Insha and English Composition currently ongoing. The CS said the invigilator in Kitui who sent away a pupil during the composition examination will be dealt with and will face the law. He however said the pupil will be graded minus the composition exam. Magoha told school heads and education officers to be extra careful because a few of them were 'playing' with the examination papers after taking them from the containers. Magoha noted that it was quite unfortunate that such people end up confusing the candidates undertaking the examinations. This is said was being done especially in the second paper. "I want to give you a heads up that there are few of us playing around with the examination papers after taking them from the examination containers and it's unfortunate," he said. He also expressed concerns over the circulation of fake examination papers by some group urging the invigilators to be extra careful. "You are aware of the circulation of fake papers by some group and these people you know them and should be ignored," the CS said. The CS was presiding over the opening and distribution of examination materials at Kisumu Central Container. He will then monitor the progress of the examination at various centres.
