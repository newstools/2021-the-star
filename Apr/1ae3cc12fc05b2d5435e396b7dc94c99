Municipal managers in Kwale county have been asked to ensure the construction of residential houses conforms to urban plans. County public health officer Saidi Mdune said most houses in the region, especially in Wayani village, Matuga, are concentrated in one place with no proper format. He said the congestion poses a great danger to people's health. "If houses are built close together like slums, it means sanitation will be compromised, threatening human life, " he said. The sanitation officer said the accumulating waste won't only become an eyesore but a health crisis. The garbage will be breeding grounds for mosquitos and flies that transmit bacterial diseases. Mdune said having houses that are aligned in a specific design will enhance safety, good hygiene and sanitation. He said in case of emergency of fire or sickness smooth and quick response can be activated. The officer encouraged residents to leave sanitary lanes about five feet apart while building settlements. The sanitary lanes are meant to provide leeway for service vehicles such as ambulances, fire extinguisher machines and garbage collection trucks to move in and out of an area. The spaces will also allow for drainage systems hence easy to access the waste for safe dumping. The Kwale county government is in the process of upgrading rural areas to major towns and urban centres. Currently, construction of roads, boreholes, dams, health care and learning facilities are ongoing in various parts of the region. According to Governor Salim Mvurya, the county aims to achieve equal development to improve locals' living standard and the economy. He said excessive developmentÂ will translate to more employment opportunities and expansive businesses activities. Mdune said there is a need for people to embrace change and adapt to the new mode of lifestyle. -Edited by SKanyara
