Wasafi signee Rayvanny has accused Harmonize of sending nude pictures to Paula Kajala, daughter of his ex-girlfriend Frida Kajala. In a long Insta Post, Rayvanny said it's shocking to see Harmonize seduce the young Paula just weeks after he lectured him (Rayvanny) for having an affair with her. Rayvanny went on to leak Harmonize’s private chats with Paula Kajala, advising him to ask for forgiveness from the public for embarrassing himself by sending nudes to Paula. He added that it's shameful to want to date Kajala and her daughter at the same time (mother and daughter). "Dunia inamaajabu yake lakini sijawahi ona mtu wa ajabu kama wewe, my bro @harmonize_tz," he wrote. "Ni binadamu wa aina gani wewe ambae unataka kua na mama na mtoto pia tena kwa nguvu zote na unatuma hadi utupu wako bila hata kuogopa nafasi ulionayo kwenye jamii kujidhalilisha kua kama ulivyozaliwa na angali wewe ni kioo cha jamii. "Ni roho ya ajabu sana ulionayo yani kila nikikuwaza sipati jibu ndugu yangu." In February, Harmonize also called out Rayvanny over his alleged relationship with Paula Kajala, daughter to his now ex-lover Frida Kajala. At that particular time, he said Rayvanny was out to ruin Paula’s life at the expense of his blossoming music career. He added that Vanny Boy opted to date Paula out of jealousy because he was dating her mother. Rayvanny apologised to Frida Kajala for over-involvement with her daughter Paula Kajala. Harmonize and actress Kajala have since broken up and the actress has deleted all photos with the singer. They started dating early this year.
