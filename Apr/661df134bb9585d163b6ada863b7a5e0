A widow was on Thursday charged in a Kakamega court with fraudulent transfer of her husband’s property. Zubeida Khasavuli was charged with fraudulently transferring a Mitsubishi lorry from her deceased husband Makokha Musindalo to herself at the Kakamega NTSA offices in March 2019. Appearing before resident magistrate Nolin Akee, Khasavuli denied the charge and was released on a Sh20,000 bond with a surety of Sh100,000. Her stepson Fami Idris is the complainant. Zubeida was accused of using the ID card and mobile phone of her deceased husband to transfer the lorry while acting as Musindalo. She is accused of having committed the offence on March 22, 2019. Akee set the case for mention on May 19 and the hearing to begin on June 21. Senior assistant director of public prosecution P.M. Gumo recommended her prosecution on April 9. Gumo said that succession cause No 13 of 2017 instituted by her was still pending at the time of the fraudulent transfer. Gumo said the accused deliberately omitted the said motor vehicle from the list of property belonging to the estate of the deceased that was earmarked for distribution for selfish reasons. “Given the foregoing, you are advised to proceed with prosecution of the accused on the recommended charges in the chief magistrate court in Kakamega,” Gumo wrote. Zubeidah is also facing another civil case filed by Fami at the Makadara law courts where she is charged with allegedly forging documents and purporting to be a director in a company, Idmus Trading Company Ltd left behind by her husband. The family has been embroiled in a succession battle involving Idmus Trading Company Ltd after the death of Makokha Musindalo on January 2, 2017. The matter was to be heard on April 15 but was pushed forward.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
