Nairobi residents have been urged not to be misled by negative propaganda about the Covid-19 vaccination and to get the jab as soon as possible. Negative reports cite terrible side effects. Some Muslims say the vaccine contains pork (not true) and others say the vaccine genetically alters those who receive it — also not true. Many people report no side effects or only mild, short-lasting side effects. Side effects include fever, dizziness, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. Jubilee politician Francis Mwangi said on Thursday it was unfortunate some people have been spreading falsehoods about the vaccine, especially on social media. Disinformation has discouraged some people from going for the jab, he said after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine at Mbagathi Hospital. “We should not listen to the negative propaganda being peddled. When we get vaccinated, the process of taking the country back to normalcy will resume," Mwangi said. "It is important we take this opportunity before things get out of hand." He said Covid-19 had spread throughout the city, so as many people as possible should get vaccinated. The Ministry of Health has said most side effects, if any, are mild to moderate and short-lasting. The benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any side efforts or contracting Covid-19. One 73-year-old woman said she felt fine after the jab and had no side effects. In Nairobi, the Ministry of Health has authorised 63 facilities to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine. They include 44 private hospitals, 10 public hospitals, and nine faith-based hospitals. Public hospitals include Kenyatta University, Mama Lucy, Mutuini Subdistrict, Mathari, Kenyatta National, Moi Air Base and Pumwani Maternity. Others are National Spinal Injury Hospital, Memorial Hospital and Mbagathi District Hospital. (Edited by V. Graham)
