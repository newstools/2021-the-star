The government has disbursed Sh15 million Youth Enterprise Development Fund to 150 youth groups in Karachuonyo, Homa Bay county. Karachuonyo MP Adipo Okuome said the money will help the young people start income-generating activities. “We want our youths to be self-reliant through empowering them economically and financially. We want to eradicate the culture of depending on handouts from politicians,” he said. Okuome advised the youth to prudently use the money to boost their businesses. “I want to urge beneficiaries to invest the money wisely if they want to reap from it and be able to repay the loan,” he said. He spoke at Alaw Rachuonyo in Kendu Bay as he disbursed funds to youth groups. The MP was accompanied by Homa Bay county youth director Elector Opar and Youth Enterprise Development Fund credit officer Judith Orero. Okuome said nobody is required to pay to access government loans, noting that approval is based on merit. The legislator asked the youth to form groups to increase their chances of securing huge amounts of money in the form of loans from the government. "We want our youths to be productive to keep them off criminal activities,” Okuome said. He said only youths in active groups will get loans. The MP further asked the government to increase loan allocation to the youth. He said the unemployment margin is big, making it difficult for the government to employ everybody. Opar asked beneficiaries not to squander the money and ensure they pay the loan. Orero said loans of Sh100,000 and Sh200,000 is payable in 12 and 18 months respectively. She said the loan uptake of youth groups in Karachuonyo stands at 95 per cent. Edited by A.N
