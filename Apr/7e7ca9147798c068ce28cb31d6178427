The body of a senior officer at the US embassy in Nairobi was found hanging in his hotel room in what appeared to be a suicide. Police and witnesses said the body of the official was found in his room hours after he had failed to report to work on Wednesday morning. Witnesses said a belt was used. The man was alone in his room at the hotel near the Village Market. “The body was found hanging near the room window. He seemed to have died long before security arrived there,” said a police officer who was at the scene. A US Embassy Nairobi spokesperson said, “We can confirm the death of a US government employee. US Embassy Nairobi extends its deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of the deceased." The man was supposed to relieve a colleague at the embassy but failed show up. Calls to his mobile phone were not being responded to, forcing the embassy staff to go check on him. Officials broke into the hotel room. A suicide note was found next to the bed. It will be subjected to examination to establish if he was the author. The body was moved to the mortuary as a probe was launched into the incident.
