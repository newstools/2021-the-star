The government will now use religious, political and business leaders to help address and boost Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy in areas that have recorded relatively low numbers. More than one month since the vaccination exercise commenced, counties especially in the Northern part of the country have continued to register low uptake mostly due to internet challenges. Data from the Ministry shows that by Friday, Marsabit county for instance had vaccinated just 465 people out of the 1,500 doses received. Tana River had vaccinated 643 people from the 1,300 doses received while Garissa had vaccinated 1,677 from the 4,100 doses received. “Some of the counties with the least uptake have informed us there have been internet challenges. The ministry has now given them gadgets and airtime so that they can transmit their information to us timely.” “So we may start seeing a little bit of more data coming in from them,” Vaccines deployment taskforce chair Willis Akhwale said. It is a prerequisite that all the data on vaccination is captured and transmitted through the Chanjo KE platform to facilitate the issuance of vaccination certificates as well as to help track doses at counties to ensure quick restocking on depletion. “Reasons dealing with hesitancy will be dealt with at the local level with the local county Covid taskforces. We have been in discussion with them so that they address hesitancy issues using their local mechanisms.” “That is the intervention that we will be following and we are hoping to see the uptake increasing,” Akhwale said. Other counties that have recorded low numbers since the exercise commenced last month include Mandera with 1,351 from the 5,800 doses received, Wajir with 1,897 from 6,000 doses. Turkana with 2,499 from the 8,500 doses received, Isiolo with 1,377 from 3,000 doses and West Pokot with 2,751 from 5,500 doses received and Samburu with 2,830 from 3,000 doses allocated. Lamu has the lowest number of those inoculated with just 461. The county received 1,500 doses. “The top five counties have taken 51 per cent of the total vaccinations and these are where the pandemic has hit hard. So it seems like when you are hit hard you know the value of why you need to be vaccinated.” They include Nairobi with 207,926, Nakuru 37,542, Uasin Gishu 33,101, Kiambu 32,920 and Nyeri with 23,733 people vaccinated. So far at least 651,650 Kenyans have received their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine against the June 30 target of 1.25 million. From the number, 365,178 are members of the public including those aged above 58 years, 136,084 are healthcare workers, 97,786 are teachers while 52,602 are security officers. The first consignment of 1.02 million doses is part of an initial allocation to Kenya of 3.56 million doses. Besides, UNICEF is providing 1,025,000 syringes and 10,250 safety boxes to Kenya, via a global stockpile funded and supported by Gavi. The second batch of vaccines is expected to arrive in the country in May amid supply chain uncertainties.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
