A lawyer on Thursday asked a Kibera magistrate to intervene and help mama mbogas to be listed among essential service providers. Lawyer Businge Robert while mitigating on behalf of a grocery seller charged with violating the curfew told senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto that the woman was doing an important job in society. She was arrested in Uthiru. “Your honour, before you is a mama mboga who was arrested while she was on her line of duty. She is remorseful and I pray this honourable court to have mercy on her. Forgiving her or a small fine will be of great help,” he told the court. The magistrate responded that the decision to change the curfew law or anything concerning essential services belonged to the Ministry of Interior. “Mr Businge we need to be realistic. I cannot just do that. I don’t have the mandate of changing the curfew laws; you know that this is not possible. If you want it to be changed you can get Matiang'i or move to the High Court,” he said. Kuto said lawyers moved to court so that they could be considered essential services providers and the court did just that. The magistrate ruled that he had considered the mitigation and ordered her to pay a fine of Sh2,000.
