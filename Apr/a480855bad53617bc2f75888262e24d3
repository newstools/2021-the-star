After ODM party leader Raila Odinga was discharged from the hospital, he has been receiving guests continuously. Raila, who was diagnosed with Covid-19, recovered from the disease early in the month. After a public appearance with the president, government officials have been paying him a courtesy call carrying gifts. On Saturday, Kiambu governor James Nyoro brought the AU envoy two goats. One white and the other a mix of brown and white. The two leaders were seen smiling as they posed for the camera while holding the two goats that were not photogenic. “Good seeing my friend the Governor of Kiambu Dr James Nyoro. Asante kwa kunitembelea na kuniletea zawadi. Nashkuru,” Raila said on his Twitter handle. Two days earlier, acting Nairobi governor Anne Kananu called on the Odinga family with two goats. Kananu dressed in kitenge regalia, took with her two white goats that she presented to Raila and his wife Ida. “Mama @IdaOdinga and I were pleased to host Nairobi Deputy Governor and acting Governor Ann Kananu Mwenda. Asante kwa zawadi ya mbuzi,” Raila said. Using her position to expand her network, Kananu said :”“Today ( Thursday)  I paid a courtesy call to Raila Odinga and Mama Ida at their home. I presented them with a gift of Mbuzi and wished the family good health and long life.” Kananu’s Karen ‘tour’ was not just a normal visit and it couldn’t be a coincidence looking at the flow of events at city hall this week. Her visit came two days after a section of ODM MCAs bashed her and Major General Mohamed Badi. Last year, Embakasi East MP Paul Ongili alias Babu Owino named his two goats after President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila. The two goats were gifted to him by a delegation from the Maasai Community for the good work he has been doing in regards to tutoring students online during this coronavirus season. "I named the goats Uhuru and Raila to honour the leaders for promoting peace and tranquillity in this country."
