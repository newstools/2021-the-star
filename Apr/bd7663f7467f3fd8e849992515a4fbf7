Thika Queens and Harambee Starlets midfielder Rachael Muema has urged local football enthusiasts to continue rallying behind the women leagues. Muema said she is impressed with the growing interest in the game across the country and went on to assure fans they won't be disappointed in the long run. “I would like to appreciate all those who usually attend our matches and those who continue pushing for the success of Kenya's Women Premier League. “Let's continue building football in the country and one day you won't regret your contributions when you eventually look back in the future,” said Muema. A seasoned national team player, Muema made the cut to the recently named Harambee Starlets squad named by immediate former head coach David Ouma for the forthcoming international friendly match against the Copper Queens of Zambia. She was part of the Harambee Starlets squad that won the 2019 Cecafa senior women in Tanzania as well as bronze at the Turkish Women’s Cup in Alanya, Turkey. She joined the KWPL straight from high school at a time it had just been established and struggling to stabilize. “I joined the KWPL as soon as I had completed school at Nginda High School in 2016 where I was the captain. The league was new at the time,” she said. She says she draws a lot of inspiration from Argentine football icon and Barcelona legend Lionel Messi.
