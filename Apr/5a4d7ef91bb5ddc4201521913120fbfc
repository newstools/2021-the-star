Deputy President William Ruto has defended the Hustler narrative saying those who fall in the category are the answer to the country's economic woes. Ruto said the bid to end the economic distress among the informs his 2022 bid. He said sorting the hustlers was the Jubilee second terms agenda citing an initial plan to create jobs for the group. "That is why we came up with the housing programme." Ruto on the other said he had at no point made reference to any group of people as dynasty. There was a recent attempt to legislate law banning such terms in political activities. Ruto in an interview with Citizen TV on Thursday dismissed assertions that his hustler polity was pointed to block the families that have held the reigns over time. Ruto defended his statement in reference to people who seek to block him from ascending to the presidency. The DP said Kenya's problem is the bad economy which can be fixed by a better leadership. "I believe with good leadership we can transform the hustlers...drive small micro enterprises..that is where mama mboga, boda boda... everyone talks about them because we have changed the conversation to be about ordinary people," he said in his defence of the slogan. Ruto said his plan is "to sort out people at the bottom of the pyramid. He said the housing programme can create four million jobs by a simple change of law to create a Housing Fund. "When we say bottom up, let's put money to that mama mboga making Sh200 a day. We will change the economy from the bottom." Ruto, saying he wouldn't want to discuss his boss, said he will change the economic model.
