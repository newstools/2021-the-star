A father in Mwingi has been accused of defiling his 15-year-old daughter. The girl said her mother had left home for her maternal place in preparation for her younger sister’s wedding. She said her father came home at around 10pm on April 10 and she served him food. After eating, he gave her his torch which she used for studying. “After I was done with my assignments, I returned the torch to him and it is at this point that he told me to spend the night with him. I refused and went to my bed,” the girl recalled amid tears. It is after retiring to her bed that the father allegedly defiled her at an unknown time. She ran to her neighbour’s house and called her mother informing her of what had happened. The mother came for her daughter and the other two children to her maternal home. “When I came home, I took my other children and went for my first-born daughter at my neighbour’s place and left his house to my parent’s house in Mwingi North,” the mother said. She said her husband has been calling, begging her to go back home but leave their daughter at her maternal place insisting the minor cannot come in between their marriage. “I am very bitter because of what he did to my daughter. I want the government to trace him and arrest him as he has since fled from home,” the woman said. Mwingi Central subcounty police commander Peter Mutuma said that efforts to arrest the perpetrator are ongoing and he would do everything possible to ensure the suspect is apprehended and charged with committing incest with a minor. The crime attracts a life sentence. Kitui Gender executive Hellena Ken said that such societal ills will not be tolerated and anyone found committing such acts will face the law. She urged mothers to report the perpetrators to end the alarming defilement cases in the county.
