The Judicial Service Commission has filed a notice of appeal against a decision that temporarily stopped it from deliberating on the choice and appointment of the next Chief Justice. A three-judge bench on Wednesday issued orders stopping the JSC from deliberating on the CJ post once the ongoing interviews are concluded on Friday. The bench comprising justices Anthony Mrima, Wilfrida Okwany and Reuben Nyakundi also stopped the commission from conducting the planned interviews for judge of the Supreme Court, pending the hearing and determination of cases challenging the constitutionality of the whole process. The orders were issued after petitioners Tolphin Nafula, Philip Muchiri, Damaris Wakiuru and Memba Ocharo challenged the constitutionality of the ongoing process.  The petitioners had filed their cases separately except for Muchiri and Wakiuru, but all matters were consolidated. Being dissatisfied with the decision, the JSC and Prof Olive Mugenda have since filed their notice and claim they intend to appeal against the whole ruling. The position of judge of the Supreme Court fell vacant following the retirement of Justice Jackton Ojwang in February 2020. Those that had been shortlisted for the Supreme Court judge position include justices Said Chitembwe, Martha Koome, M’inoti Kathurima, Nduma Nderi, Lumumba Nyaberi, William Ouko, Joseph Sergon and Alice Yano.
