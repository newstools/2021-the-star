Mt Kenya leaders have not created a list of demands to Deputy President William Ruto to support the DP, Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu has said. Wambugu said the purported list of demands was generated by Ruto's allies in the Tangatanga faction of Jubilee. He said he was astonished by the development because the MPs have committed themselves to Ruto and have been campaigning for him. “They have told us and everybody that as far as they are concerned, Ruto is the best candidate for 2022,” he said. The MP said creating a list of demands was taking the region’s people for a ride as there is no way one can give demands to someone they support. Wambugu was responding to media reports that Mt Kenya MPs had decided to open negotiations with DP Ruto in exchange for their political support ahead of the 2022 elections. “It is quite embarrassing for them to be out here telling us that they now want to negotiate. Who are they negotiating on behalf of?” Wambugu asked. “If Ruto for example refuses to listen to their demands, what are they going to do to him? Are they going to leave him?” He said the group may have realised that Ruto is not popular and are now looking for an exit strategy. “They did not need to negotiate as they believed that he already has the region’s support.” “If the region is firmly behind Ruto, what are they negotiating for? You only negotiate for something that you do not have,” he said. Wambugu said the way to go was to summarise the region’s needs then start looking for the person who would accommodate them. However, he said, one cannot start with identifying a candidate, pledge support to the aspirant, then present a list of demands to him or her.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
