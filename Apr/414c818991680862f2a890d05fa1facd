Football Kenya Federation President Nick Mwendwa has sent a message of condolence to the bereaved family and friends of the late FKF Kisumu branch chairman, Dickson Oruko. The curtains finally fell on Oruko at the Eldoret Referral Hospital on Wednesday after a long battle with diabetes. “I am saddened by the passing on of FKF Kisumu Branch Chairman, Dickson Oruko,” mourned Mwendwa. The FKF boss said death had robbed him of a self-driven and focused colleague who shared the vision of the national office at the grassroots. “Chair Oruko has not only supported my football development agenda, wholeheartedly, but has also been at the forefront in running our grass root football development programs in Kisumu. “Football has lost a self driven, purposeful and passionate leader. “My thoughts are with his friends and family, and all those he served under his administration. May you all find solace during these trying times,” said Mwendwa. Oruko was serving his first term in office, having previously occupied the FKF Nyanza North secretary seat before taking a stab at his new role. He beat Chemelil Sugar chairman Moses Adagala in the tense polls that were punctuated with chaos and protests following claims of irregularities. Oruko and Adagala squared up to each other in a heated disagreement over irregular ballot papers and police officers had to lob tear gas canisters in the air to disperse supporters of the two candidates who had begun disrupting counting of votes. By the time normalcy resumed, Oruko had amassed a staggering 36 votes against Adagala's five to run away with the seat.
