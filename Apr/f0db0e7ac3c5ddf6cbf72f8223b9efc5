Former Tusker midfielder Tom Adwar has penned a deal with US United Premier Soccer League Division One side, Texas Spurs. Adwar, 26, took to his Twitter account to announce he would be returning to football after being out of the pitch for a lengthy period of time. “Just ain’t done yet. Starting again!!” read the message. He had shoved his boots aside for a while since 2019 when he landed a four-year academic and soccer scholarship at the Murray State College in the US, where he is studying accounting. Other than Tusker, Adwar previously featured for Sofapaka, Mt. Kenya United, Kakamega Homeboyz, and Muhoroni Youth. His career took off in Kisumu where he initially turned out for Ramogi FC in Kisumu and later joined Palos before signing up for Agrochemicals in the National Super League.
