A Nairobi court has allowed police to continue holding two suspects accused of defrauding Kenyans using fake Kenya Defence Forces recruitment letters. Milimani senior principal magistrate Kenneth Cheruiyot allowed the DCI to detain Kenneth Jumbe Onsongo and Charles Kamau Kimani for seven days to enable the police to complete Investigations on alleged theft of money from innocent members of the public by giving them fake KDF recruitment papers. In an affidavit filed in court, Corporal Patrick Kibowen requested the two suspects be detained for a week to enable them to assist in the ongoing probe. The police revealed that the suspects are likely to be charged with forgery and obtaining money by false pretences. Kibowen told the court he was apprehensive that the two suspects might flee if released on bail. He added that the duo might also interfere with investigations and he had yet to forward the documents to KDF headquarters for verification purposes. The court heard that the fake recruitment letters were recovered from the complainants who were arrested at the Nairobi bus terminus while preparing to travel to Recruit Training School in Eldoret. Police say the two suspects have failed to refund the money they obtained from the complainants. The arrest of the suspects within Nairobi central business district came after three other suspects were arrested in Kasarani for presenting themselves as military officers capable of recruiting aspiring people into KDF. Elisha Onyango, Derrick Nyakundi and Amos Mutuku were arrested on Monday last week following complaints from members of the public. Further, the police report says the suspects obtained Sh350,000 from Mbabu John to have his son recruited into KDF and a fake recruitment letter to that effect was found in their possession.
