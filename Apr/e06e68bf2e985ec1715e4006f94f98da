Actress Brenda Wairimu says she hated her big lips while growing up. In an Instagram post, the mother of one shared a picture of the first paid advert she featured in, saying her lips came in handy. “I hated my big lips growing up, they ended up being the reason I got this gig... There is a lesson in there somewhere. Remember the beginning... Throwback to my first ever paid advert, years ago.” Commenting on her post, actress Nyce Wanjeri said she hated her big eyes growing up, and now they are her asset when it comes to acting. “I hated my eyes they are big and I was, aaah okey, I am still slender. Now they are my asset in acting 😍. Go girl thanks for this reminder.”
