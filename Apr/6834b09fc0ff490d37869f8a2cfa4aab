A record 32 county assemblies debated a BBI Bill containing errors, the joint committee considering the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 has confirmed. Speaking on Friday after week-long deliberation, the joint committee however downplayed the errors as minor and correctable. Joint chairs Muturi Kigano (Kangema MP) and Senator Okong'o Omogeni (Nyamira) told journalists that the report is now ready and will be sent to the two speakers. The leaders said the discrepancies are captured in the report that will be tabled in Parliament. "We have taken note and that affects 32 County Assemblies and that is captured in our report," Omogeni said. "There were no two copies of the Bill. There could be small errors here and there but that is correctable," added Kigano. Kigano said all the members of the joint team appended their signatures on the report except Murang'a Senator Irungu Kangata who abstained. This comes a day after the IEBC distanced itself from the confusion over the different versions of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2020. In a statement on Thursday, IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati said that the commission forwarded to counties the same copies of the document that it received from the BBI promoters. “The commission would like to state that on December 10, 2020, it received from BBI promoters six printed copies of the draft of the Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020 and supporters’ details,” Chebukati said. He added that after the verification exercise that concluded and ascertained one million supporters thresholds had been met, it requested BBI promoters for additional copies of the draft to send to the counties.
