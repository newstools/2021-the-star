The United Democratic Alliance has called on interested aspirants to register with the party. In a statement on Monday, the party's Secretary General Veronica Maina announced that UDA had established an Aspirants and Leadership Forum where those interested to run for elective posts through the party can register. "This forum will offer a platform for all aspirants and leaders who support UDA to engage on all matters and participate in the party activities to inform the party on decision making processes," Maina said. The party is charging Sh10,000 registration fee for governors, deputies and senators aspirants. Aspirants for the women Rep, Member of Parliament as well as those wishing to be party leaders are to part with Sh5,000 registration fee. Sh2,000 is the fee for anyone seeking to be an MCA with the UDA ticket. The forum is expected to hold its first meeting in 14 days where only fully paid up aspirants will be admitted. This comes weeks after Deputy President William Ruto's allies vowed to fuel UDA as his 2022 vehicle. Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and his Keiyo South counterpart Daniel Rono on Monday said they will never set foot in Jubilee offices instead, they will channel their money to UDA, which they said Ruto will use to  vie for President in 2022 “If there is anyone still in Jubilee, then it should be President Kenyatta and Ruto. The rest of us left long ago and we are now in UDA,” Sudi said during a media briefing at his home in Eldoret.
