Nairobians will not look at the Tom Mboya statue along Moi Avenue the same after a major refurbishment. The rehabilitation followed public outcry last year over its sorry state. The statue is stationed along Moi Avenue, Nairobi. It was erected in 2011 in honour of the Independence politician who was assassinated in 1969. It stands about 20 metres from where he was murdered. In September, the statue was pulled down and ferried to the National Museums of Kenya – the main custodian of all national monuments. According to museums director general Mzalendo Kibunjia, the contractors, Great levels Limited, was awarded Sh4 million by the Sports Fund for the facelift. The statue is now be surrounded by barriers that will prevent anybody from getting close to it. “It is designed in such a way that nobody can climb all the way up to the statue like before. We have put in place mechanisms and ensured that even if they jump in, they will not be able to climb up because of the slanting polished tiles that are three metres high,” Samson Malaki, an architect and designer with the National Museums, said. At the bottom of the statue, there are plaques on all four sides. To ensure security, a CCTV camera will be placed at the National Archives building. Security guards will also be at the site round the clock.
