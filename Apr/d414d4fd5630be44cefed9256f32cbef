A school principal has been arrested for alleged KCSE examinations theft in Machakos County. Betta Mutuku of ABC Kiseveni Secondary School within Machakos subcounty was nabbed by DCI sleuths on Tuesday morning. The detectives were led by Machakos subcounty Criminal Investigations Officer Rhoda Kanyi who said they acted on intelligence information. Kanyi said the principal is suspected to have taken a photo of today's KCSE Mathematics examinations paper and uploaded it on her WhatsApp status for candidates to study. She said Mutuku allegedly committed the crime last evening. The suspect was whisked to Machakos police station where she is currently being questioned by CID officers. "She had posted the examinations on her status for the candidates to study at night," Kanyi told reporters during the arrest. The principal's phone was confiscated by the police officers to aid in the investigations. The incident occurred barely a week since five candidates were arrested for allegedly stealing examinations last Thursday. The five from Alim Secondary School in Mavoko subcounty were arrested by DCI officers after they were done with the day's examinations. It is said that the suspects had written answers on their shirts. The DCI detectives acted on a tip-off that led to the raid. The school has been visited twice by Education CS George Magoha since this year's KCSE examinations began. They are expected to be arraigned in Machakos Law Courts this evening after they are done with today's exams.
