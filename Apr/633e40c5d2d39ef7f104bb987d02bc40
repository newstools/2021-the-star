Veteran journalist and former Sunday Nation columnist Philip Ochieng is dead. The family confirmed the veteran journalist succumbed to pneumonia at his Awendo home in  Migori. He had been admitted at the Ombo  mission hospital and was discharged last week. Ochieng previously served as an editor for Nation Media Group. Several people have taken to Twitter to eulogize the  long-serving columnist. Radio Africa Group Digital Editor Oliver Mathenge eulogized the late Ochieng as a man whose pen shaped many in the media industry. "The 5th columnist was a man full of knowledge & always eager to share. A man who told me I cannot say or write 'cant be able' some 13 years ago at Nation Centre," Mathenge said. Media personality and sports journalist Carol Radull said, "He was my "work Dad" at my very first real job at Camerapix when I was barely out of  school." ODM Communication Director Philip Etale said the media fraternity and the nation as a whole have lost a great writer and teacher. Head of Development and Learning for Nation Media Group said, "Here lies a giant! I first encountered him in ‘Tongue in Cheek’, then he stretched it all the way to ‘Fifth Columnist’. What a life in journalism. Go there well senior. Editors, journalists and the entire media fraternity wish you eternal peace."
