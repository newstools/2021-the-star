Kenya has suspended passenger flight from India to Kenya for the next 14 days, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has announced. The new directive will take effect in the next 72 hours. This follows a surge in Covid-19 cases in India. Kagwe however said cargo flights will continue upon adherence to the Coronavirus containment measurers. Those arriving in the country in the next 72 hours from India shall undertake mandatory testing. Those found positive for Covid-19 shall be isolated for 14 days at their own cost. Kagwe spoke on Wednesday at Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi, Taita Taveta County. Meanwhile, Indians struggled to register online for a mass vaccination drive set to begin next month as the countryâ€™s toll from the coronavirus surged past 200,000 on Wednesday, worsened by shortages of hospital beds and medical oxygen. The second wave of infections has seen at least 300,000 people test positive each day for the past week, overwhelming health facilities and crematoriums and fuelling an increasingly urgent response from allies overseas sending equipment. The last 24 hours brought 360,960 new cases for the world's largest single-day total, taking India's tally of infections to nearly 18 million. It was also the deadliest day so far, with 3,293 fatalities carrying the toll to 201,187. Experts believe the official tally vastly underestimates the actual toll in a nation of 1.35 billion, however.
