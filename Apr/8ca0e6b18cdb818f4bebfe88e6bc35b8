The Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya on Thursday organized a one-day virtual workshop for local athletes. The athletes drawn from different sport disciplines were taken through anti-doping topics by ADAK educators as per the requirement in the International Standard for Education. They included renowned middle-distance runner David Rudisha, Kenya national boxing team captain Nick Okoth and his counterpart Elizabeth Andiego. Speaking to the Star on Friday, Andiego said she benefited immensely from the workshop, adding the process would protect Kenyan athletes from falling victim to substance abuse in pursuit of fame and fortune. “We were asked to file our whereabouts consistently on a quarterly basis because doing so would make it easy for the ADAK officers to take our samples conveniently. “We were further warned that failure to follow the given guidelines for three consecutive times might result in a ban,” she added. “There are athletes who are placed in a pool and whose samples are taken consistently, but there are those whose samples might be taken randomly. It all depends on the status of the athlete,” said Andiego. Athletes at the highest level of their sport are selected for what is known as a Registered Testing Pool. RTP athletes are required to undergo training on all anti-doping topics. ADAK Education and Research team confirmed they had a fruitful anti-doping education session with the various athletes who are incorporated in the ADAK Registered Testing Pool (RTP).
