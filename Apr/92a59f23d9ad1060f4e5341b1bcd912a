Parents in Homa Bay have been asked to watch over their children as sexual predators are getting brazen. More than 12 girls have been defiled in Rangwe and Homa Bay Town constituencies between March and April. Majority were sexually abused by people close to them or relatives. On Wednesday, the Children Services department warned the number could be higher as some cases go unreported. “Many birthday parties and other celebrations which children attend turn into preying places where the vices and perpetrated,” said Children's officer Joseph Otieno. Homa Bay is one of the counties with a high number of teenage pregnancies resulting from defilement. It is ranked number two after Narok. Speaking to journalists in his office, Otieno said the closure of schools for the April holiday is likely to worsen matters. “Some people hide behind the myth that defiling children can cure an HIV-positive person. Let parents keenly watch their children,” he said. Otieno gave the example of a case at Rodi Kopany market where a man is accused of defiling his six-year-old niece. He blamed the girl’s parents for abandoned their role. “We have arrested the man and he will be charged. We’re soon beginning to charge parents for neglecting their children,” Otieno said. Last year Interior CS Fred Matiang’i visited Homa Bay and directed security officers to arrest and prosecute child defilers. He said they registered more than 7,000 cases of sexual molestations in Homa Bay in 2020 and some were done by people the children trusted.
