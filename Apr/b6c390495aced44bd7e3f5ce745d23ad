Morans will train at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani ahead of their FIBA Afro-Basket finals in Kigali, Rwanda, according to Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) secretary Ambrose Kisoi. Kisoi said they will secure Kasarani for the team’s trainings this time round since the complex meets the international standards. Previously, the national team held all their training sessions at the Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium. All seven foreign-based players are expected to report back later next month to start preparations for the August 24- September 5 continental show. “We have retained those who made the team last time and asked the technical bench to add a maximum of only two,” he disclosed. The diaspora players are—Tylor Ongwae, Preston Bungei (Denmark), Desmond Owili (Australia), Ronny Gundo (USA), Joel Awich (France), Ariel Okal (Gulf) and Tom Wamukota (Rwanda). After the 16-team continental festival, Kenya will shift their focus to the World Cup qualifiers set for November. On the national women’s team front, Kisoi said treasurer Peter Orero will chair a team that will name the coach and draw a road map to the up coming Afro-Basket Championships. “His team will name the coaches and pick the players to prepare for continental showpiece,” he added.
