Many cases of rape and defilement are not reported to the Nyamira children's office, an official has said. Billy Adera, a children officer in Nyamira South subcounty said more pregnancy cases were brought to their attention. “Our data may not coincide because most of these cases such as rape and defilement go unreported and therefore denying us the opportunity to have fully compiled data that may reflect the actual figures of those who go through these vices in society,” Adera said. He said only parents and guardians who are interested in the well-being of their children were willing to report incidents. Data shows that between July 2020 and March, Nyamira South had 116 neglect cases, 13 child pregnancies and 15 defilement cases. Some nine cases of child labour cases and four of marriage were reported. Nyamaiya, Keera and West Mugirango were most affected. “It seems to many rape or defilement is not a problem as much as pregnancy is and that is why they would rather rush to report a pregnancy case than a defilement case,” Adera said. The department of children services recently said children were being hired as bar maids and attendants. Adera called for intervention from both the public and the government to curb such cases. “Action has been taken against those employing young girls who are supposed to be in school. This is one of the reasons we need everyone who has reached the age of getting a national identification card to do so to help us identify the underage girls and boys who are engaging in illicit business,” Adera noted.
