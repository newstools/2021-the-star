The Kisumu teenager who decapitated his 70-year-old grandmother will remain in police cells until on Monday This is after a Kisumu court granted the Directorate of Criminal Investigations more time to complete investigations. They will also carry out mental examinations and establish whether there were other accomplices to the murder. On Monday, the 19-year-old suspect Kevin Okal Odhiambo walked to thepolice station with the head of the deceased. Police officers manning the station had initially thought he was at the station to see a relative or wanted to make a report. But they were shocked when the man asked the officers to check what he was carrying inside the bucket. The suspect was arrested locked up at the station. He later led the officers, led by the OCS central police station, to a tin-roofed semi-permanent house which he shared with the old lady at the Nyalenda Kilo estate. OCS Kisumu Central, OC crime, OC Nyalenda, DCI officers and scenes of crime personnel visited the scene and established that the suspect had murdered the deceased by use of a Jembe. The suspect had earlier been released from Shikutsa juvenile remand home for the offence of stealing. According to the police, his motive is believed to be family dispute. According to the neighbours, the suspect left the estate at around 2.55pm carrying a bag and two buckets. He then left the house using a motorbike but nobody had any idea what he had done. It would later emerge that what he was carrying in one of the buckets was her grandmother's head. The body is at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga teaching and referral hospital mortuary . Mention of the case will be on Monday 12. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
