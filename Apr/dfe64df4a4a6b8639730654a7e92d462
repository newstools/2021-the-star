South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has announced the suspension of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 jab to investigate a possible link with blood clots. Mkhize said the decision was a "precautionary suspension." Hours earlier US health authorities paused the use of the one dose jab after cases of extremely rare blood clotting. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said six cases in 6.8 million doses had been reported and it was acting "out of an abundance of caution". Johnson & Johnson said it was also delaying its vaccine rollout in Europe. The US move follows similar rare cases in the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has prompted some curbs in its use.
