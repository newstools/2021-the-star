Former Rangwe MP Philip Okundi has challenged Homa Bay politicians to develop ideas to improve the county’s economic status. Okundi said there are many youths who have acquired necessary skills and knowledge, who can easily get absorbed and help develop the county with such ideas. The former lawmaker, who is a commissioner at the National Cohesion and Integration Commission,  said Homa Bay has the potential to achieve its development goals should leaders tap in the resources it has. “Let Homa Bay politicians and leaders focus more on ideas that can transform the county. We should strive to create jobs for the youth,” Okundi said during the burial of the Janeiro Group of Schools proprietor Jim Akello at Ongeti village in Rangwe. Okundi also asked politicians to refrain from utterances that are against peace. He asked elected leaders concentrate on fulfilling their election pledges ahead 2022 polls. “I know we cannot fulfil all what we promise the electorate but it is better you try finish some than we see you engaging in premature politics,” he added. Present were county BBI coordinator Agutu Jakorayo, Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga, Kochia MCA Ojala Nyang’i and politicians Omburo Daje, Enosh Bolo among others. Jakorayo cautioned youths against being used by politicians to disrupt peace. “We’re asking our youths not to use social media to abuse elected leaders. You’ll waste a lot of your time when arrested and prosecuted,” Jakorayo told the youth. Wanga and Nyang’i described Akello as a humble man who helped transform lives of many youths through his love of education. Wanga said Akello spent most of resources in educating children. “We have lost a great man whose focus and interest were geared towards helping people. Akello is worth emulated,” Wanga said. Nyang’I called on the Kochia clan to unite and ensure they fulfil the dreams left behind by Akello. “Let’s not stop extending a helping hand to the youths so that we can all grow together,” he said.
