The ODM party has for a second time recommended another candidate for the position of deputy governor nominee for Nyamira county. In a letter that was sent to speaker Moffat Teya and governor Amos Nyaribo on Monday, the party recommended Charles Rigoro to be deputy governor nominee. “As communicated earlier in our letter dated January 20, signed by chairman John Mbadi, the party has recommended Charles Rigoro for the nomination to the position of deputy governor in line with an existing understanding with governor Amos Nyaribo,” read part of the letter. The statement further states; "The details of this understanding are well known by the parties and it is our expectation that the terms hereof will be honoured." When contacted, ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna verified the letter was authentic. The letter comes a second time as governor Nyaribo maintains he will stick to his choice, Dr James Gesami for the position of deputy governor. Gesami’s appointment was rejected by both the assembly’s appointment committee and the whole assembly in February, prompting Nyaribo to hold several meetings with MCAs, in a bid to convince them to approve his deputy governor nominee. The approval is yet to take place, since the debate on the approval that was supposed to happen last Friday never happened. Nyaribo cited political forces as being behind his disappointments but maintained that he will keep on working for the people of Nyamira county saying those who want to frustrate him do not have the people at heart.
