Labour Court Judge Nduma Nderi has said he is the person to unlock the stalemate over the appointment of the 41 judges to the Judiciary. Justice Nderi says he has done a lot of consensus-building and he will deal with the matter using his negotiations skills. Nderi is one of the 10 shortlisted candidates for the position of Kenya's next Chief Justice. Judge Nderi on Monday told the JSC panel that heads of state are too busy to deal with issues that have not been narrowed down. "I will engage some of the most senior officials even in this commission to help us unlock the stalemate. I believe that I will be able to unlock this issue," he said. Justice Nderi affirmed that he will deal with corruption in the Judiciary head-on. "Even one per cent of corruption in the Judiciary is unacceptable," he said. Justice Nderi said he agrees that the perception out there that the Judiciary corrupt is very strong. However, he says that the reports paint a totally different picture saying 70 per cent of people are happy with the fight against corruption by the Judiciary. Judge Nderi says in his tenure as CJ, he will not give up on the issue of corruption but will come up with measures to curb the vice. "I will use radio as a medium to communicate with Kenyans and create awareness on the issue of corruption," he said.
