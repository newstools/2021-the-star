West Bromwich Albion ensured they stayed alive in the battle for Premier League survival following Saturday’s 5-2 demolition of 10-man Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, manager Sam Allardyce said. Matheus Pereira and Callum Robinson scored twice each to hand Thomas Tuchel his first defeat as the Chelsea manager, ending the London club’s 14-match unbeaten run under the German. Second-bottom West Brom are on 21 points - seven points adrift of the safety zone with eight games to play. “It gives us hope,” Allardyce said. “Perhaps on the quality of the performance and the way we demolished Chelsea, a little bit more than hope. It keeps us alive. “They demolished a Chelsea with an undefeated record since the new manager arrived. That’s what the Premier League is about – teams at the bottom beating teams at the top.” Chelsea conceded eight goals in their two league games against West Brom this season — the most they have shipped against a team in a single campaign in the competition. “People cannot say Chelsea were under par. They were off form because we were so good,” Allardyce added. “We need five wins out of the last eight to give ourselves a chance. Still that might not be enough. Let’s start against Southampton (on Monday).”
