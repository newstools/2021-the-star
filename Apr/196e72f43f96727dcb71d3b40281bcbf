Anerlisa Muigai has urged men to keep off her direct message (DM) platform. In her Insta stories, the Keroche Breweries heiress said men have been on her case, asking for her hand in marriage. "The number of people always ready to take over somebody else's position is the reason why most relationships fail," she said. This comes after a Tanzanian blog reported that her singer husband Ben Pol has filed for divorce at a Tanzanian court. According to the blog, Millard Ayo, it is still not clear why the two are divorcing. "If you go through my DM, you would think I had a contest looking for a partner. It is disgusting to also see people offering to marry me yet you do not even know me personally," Anerlisa said. She went on to advise young men to stop lusting over her with hopes of making her their sponsor. "Reality is I am not looking for anybody and I am not free. And to the 80 per cent F boys in my DM, try to pull up your socks and start working hard for your money. Looking for independent women to take care of you is really short-term. Women also get tired of taking care of you. If you know, you know." Ben Pol and Anerlisa held a private wedding attended by close family members early last year. The two have since unfollowed each other on Instagram, where they used to share many details about their marriage. Anerlisa has also deleted all photos of Ben Pol from her page.
