Shujaa are keen to improve on skills, fitness and conditioning before the final pre-Olympic tournament slated for Los Angeles in June. Kenya Sevens skipper Andrew Amonde said with one event remaining before the Tokyo, there is time to work on the three facets. “I was playing for the first time in Sevens tournament  in a year and getting used to the rigours will take a while. We have one more event in the USA and we hope to be in peak condition by that time," he added. Shujaa had a mixed tournament in the Emirates invitational tournaments in Dubai, reaching the semifinal in the opener but suffered a shock 14-12 defeat to minnows Chile in the Cup quarterfinals in the second tournament which concluded on Friday. Innocent Simiyu's charges bounced back to beat Spain 27-15 and Uganda 36-5 in the classification matches to finish fifth. They, however, missed out on an opportunity to build on last weekend's performance, where they reached the semis. Shujaa had started the tournament well by winning their three preliminary matches, beating Uganda 28-10, Canada 21-10 and Spain 17-14 only to stumble in the quarters against the less fancied Chile.  Amonde said the event was an eye-opener for them considering they were competitive against the likes of  France and Canada. The team jetted back to the country on Saturday and will have one week break before heading to camp at Moi Stadium, Kasarani to start preparations for the final pre-Olympic warm up tournament. Head coach Innocent Simiyu saidplaymaker Sammy Oliech faces lengthy spells on the sidelines having suffered an Achilles injury in Dubai with the rest of the squad fit. The team will train in a bubble in accordance to the Covid -19 protocols and will get vaccinated in the next couple of days.
