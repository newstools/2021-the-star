Local retailer Tusker Mattresses Ltd is set to roll out an up to 90% Discount Sale this weekend at its flagship Tuskys T-Mall hypermarket location. The Up to 90% clearance sale, which kicks off on April 29, will feature a selection of household, furniture and clothing items and will be hosted in strict compliance with Covid-19 protocols. Tusker Mattresses interim CEO Chadwick Okumu said the sale will be staged at the T-Mall Parking Silo. "Proceeds will be ploughed back into the business to finance fast-moving lines in all active branches as a means of growing footfall further by expanding FMCG product ranges and subsequently enhancing customer satisfaction," he said. The subtle recovery plan, Okumu said, has seen the retailer nurse to life nine key branches in Nairobi, Machakos, Kajiado, Narok and Mombasa, with gradual but consistent growth in sales revenue being recorded over the last three months. The nine branches include Tuskys T-Mall, Tuskys Karasha (Kenyatta Avenue), Tuskys Imara (Tom Mboya Street), Tuskys Ongata Rongai, Tuskys Thigiri, Tuskys Ol-Talet, Tuskys Bandari, Tuskys Eastlands (Buruburu) with Tuskys Milele (Ngong) set to reopen within the next two weeks as the tenth operating branch. The Up to 90% Discount Sale, he added, will also provide an opportunity for bargain hunters to acquire quality retail items at rock bottom prices. “It is also an opportunity to liquidate stocks and generate much-needed cash to fund operations at the ten running branches,” Okumu said. Okumu explained that the firm would maintain a cash lite sales option with all payments to be settled via M-Pesa.
