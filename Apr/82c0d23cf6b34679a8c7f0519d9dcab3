The United Nations Security Council has said that its attention has been attracted by the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. In a statement on Thursday, the council said that the humanitarian challenges are still in the region despite the efforts by the government of Ethiopia to provide humanitarian assistance as well as increasing humanitarian access. The council has called for a scaled-up humanitarian response and unfettered humanitarian access to all people in need, including in the context of the food security situations. Members of the security council have called for a continuation of international relief efforts in a manner that is consistent with the UN guiding principles of humanitarian emergency assistance. UNSC has also said that the insecurity in the region constitutes an impediment to the ongoing humanitarian operations and has called for the restoration of normalcy. “The members of Security Council expressed their deep concern about allegations of human rights violations and abuses, including reports of sexual violence against women and girls in the Tigray region and called for investigations to find those responsible and bring them to justice,” part of UNSC statement reads. They also reiterated their strong support to regional and sub-regional efforts from African Union, IGAD as they continued with their engagement to bring normalcy to the volatile region. They further reaffirmed their strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity, and unity of Ethiopia.
