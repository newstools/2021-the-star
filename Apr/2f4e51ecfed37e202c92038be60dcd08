Unesco Director-General Audrey Azoulay has called on Kenya to investigate the murder of television journalist Betty Barasa. Barasa was shot dead at her home in Ngong on April 7. Police said the gunmen behind the murder of Betty Barasa were on an assassination mission. "I condemn the killing of Betty Barasa. I call on the authorities to investigate this crime and determine whether it was linked to Barasa’s profession as a journalist. Gunpoint censorship must not be allowed to undermine journalists’ ability to carry out their work," Azoulay said in a statement on Tuesday. Unesco promotes the safety of journalists through global awareness-raising, capacity building and a range of actions, notably in the framework of the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity. The well-known journalist died of a single wound to the face by an AK-47 or other combat rifle in Oloolua, Ngong. The day KBC journalist Betty Barasa was gunned down at her Ngong’ home, her husband had printed her final master's thesis for ready for submission. Geoffrey Namachanja said the brutal killing of his wife of 17 years in the presence of his three children had struck a blow against his family. "I was waiting for her to come and check the document and, if okay, submit to her lecturer so she could complete her course," he said, adding that he had secured some money to register Betty for a PhD programme. He spoke during a requiem mass for the murdered video editor at Montezuma Monalisa Funeral Home in Nairobi. And turning to the casket bearing the body of his wife, Geoffrey said; "Betty my wife, I'm sorry you have to go this way. I will take care of the children and sustain your life purpose."
