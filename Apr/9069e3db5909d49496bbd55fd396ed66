General Service Unit (GSU) coach Gideon Tarus says the absence of 14-time African Club Championship record winners Al Ahly in this year's edition will play in their favour. GSU, who won the title in 2018, are the only team to have stopped the Egyptian team from winning their fifth title in a row. Tarus said they have a chance of recapturing the title in the absence of Al Ahly and Smouha of Tunisia The paramilitary side will be banking on the services of international setter Brian Melly, centre player Simon Kipkorir and Cornelius Kiplagat who were part of the Kenya team during the 2019 Zone Five All Africa Games qualifiers. Naftali Chumba is also a key cog in the side. "We have a genuine chance to win the title. Al Ahly have been our biggest threat for a while now and they won't be there. Therefore, our stakes are high with regards to winning the title," said Tarus. GSU have put together a strong team of 14 players and three officials-namely, coach, assistant coach and one top official from GSU department who will leave for Tunisia on Friday (today). On arrival in Tunis, the team will hold a light training session on Friday evening to shake off the jet lag. The team will train again on Saturday ahead of the kick off on Sunday. The team will not have a doctor but will depend on the one from Confederation of African Volleyball (CAVB). "The one we have has not been been accredited until next year. My hope isÂ  that the players remain injury-free. I would also love to play my first match against an 'easy to beat' team in the pool," he said. Basics have been the team's biggest weakness and Tarus has been burning the midnight oil to correct the mess.
