Tusker's first choice custodian Robert Mboya is gearing up for training after recovering from a nasty injury that has kept him out of action for the better part of the season. The veteran keeper, who joined the brewers from Mathare United during the 2018 transfer window, was stretchered off and rushed to hospital after picking up a fracture on the arm during their league match against Kariobangi Sharks at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Mboya appeared comfortable at the club's gym in Ruaraka on Tuesday morning, where he was seen lifting weights effortlessly. "The pain has subsided and I think the arm will be strong enough to catch the ball as usual without strain by next week. I have been lifting weights in the gym without strain in the past one week," he said. Mboya has suffered a streak of injuries lately, having previously been substituted early in the game after suffering jaw injury in the brewers' 1-0 win over Vihiga United in December last year after he ran into a charging opponent while advancing to clear a looming danger. His return will be a shot in the arm of the Robert Matano-led charges who have exhibited every intent to run away with the title. They sit comfortably at the summit of the log after amassing 36 points from 16 matches this seasonâ€”six adrift of second-placed KCB and 14 clear of defending champions Gor Mahia who are rooted in seventh.
