Kiss FM co-host Jalang'o says his mother is struggling with her health. Jalang'o spoke during the morning Kiss during his birthday, saying for some time, many have been asking why he hasn't been posting his mother on social media. He said it is because she has not been feeling well. "I want to take this opportunity to thank my mom who even right now is bedridden and struggling so much with her health. Mommy has not been well for a very long time," he said. The presenter has many times confessed his undying love for his mother. "My mum is the most amazing woman on earth. She is the best woman," he said in a past interview. He is building her a mansion that is almost complete. Jalang'o's lost his father just hours after landing his first gig at Kiss 100 a few years ago.
