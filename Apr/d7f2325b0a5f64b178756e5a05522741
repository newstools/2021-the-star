Kwale Health executive Francis Gwama has urged those targeted in the first phase of Covid-19 vaccination drive to go for the jab. They included security officer, teachers, healthcare workers and the elderly. The county had targeted to vaccinate 3,000 security officers, 2,500 healthcare workers and over 500 teachers in the first phase. But by Thursday this week only 923 healthcare workers, 294 security officers, 458 teachers had received the jab. For residents aged above 58 years, only 860 have been vaccinated. The county has so far received 6,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine since the government rolled out the drive. About 10,000 doses are expected to be disbursed by the end of June. The Kwale government launched its first phase of vaccination in mid-March targeting high-risk groups. Gwama, who received his first dose of the vaccine in March, said the vaccine is safe and there is nothing to worry about. "Kindly ignore rumors, and go for vaccination, " he said. Gwama said the county has increased the number of vaccination centres in all the four subcounties of Matuga, Kinango, Msambweni and Lunga-Lunga. At least over 600 cases of the virus have been reported in Kwale since the pandemic started. Three Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment in Msambweni. The second phase of the vaccination drive will be in July.
