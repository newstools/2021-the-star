Chelsea vs Fulham, Saturday (19:30) Chelsea will be delighted to be playing at home against their local rivals Fulham between the two legs of their Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid. The hosts have a fantastic record against their guests and will probably risk resting a couple of key players during this match-up. Fulham arrive in the midst of a five-game win-less run. In addition to being unbeaten against Fulham in 20 competitive meetings, Chelsea have won all London derbies (of four) played in the league in 2021 alone. The last three saw them consistently win the first half to-nil.  April 2018 remains the last occasion on which Chelsea lost after scoring first in any Premier League London derby at home. Fulham are win-less in their last 23 top-flight London derby matches going back to 2014. Fulham have also taken no point from the last three H2Hs vs Chelsea and this has seen them trail at HT. Despite gaining neutral admirers in their last London derby, where they drew against Arsenal, Fulham still remain deep in relegation trouble. A goal affair may be a safe pick given Chelsea may rest key players.

Having beaten Leeds 1-0 in January, Graham Potter’s side will strive to snap a run of four games without a win, the last three of which saw them fail to score. Brighton have scored an average of just a goal-a-match here. Nonetheless, just two league losses over the last such eight at home means they could well extend their four-match winning streak here versus Leeds. Leeds come into this one with their eyes firmly on a top-half finish. Leeds have put together their longest unbeaten run of the campaign, extending their tally to six after a scoreless draw with Manchester United. Leeds are the only PL side yet to draw an away game, where they have won eight and lost eight, as they go in search of their first three-game winning streak on the road this season. Brighton are not an easy side to win against, and they will attack Leeds. The Whites showed remarkable defensive astuteness against United this past weekend, and given how good they are in creating chances and scoring goals, it is very likely that they will pick up all three points from the encounter.

With seven of their last nine SA matches witnessing over 4.5 goals, more action should be in store as they host Inter Milan. Although losing six of their last seven SA home games, Crotone have picked up more than half of their points this campaign on home ground. Close to winning their first league title in 11 years, Inter Milan arrive in southern Italy as heavy favourites. The champions-elect have been level at HT in six of their last nine SA games as they continue to struggle before the break. Unbeaten in nine of their last ten SA away games, Inter continue to dominate on the road. Both teams to score in this match up will definitely be a safe pick.
