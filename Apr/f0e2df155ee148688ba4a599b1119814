Runyenjes Law Courts in Embu County has been temporarily closed for a period of seven days. The move comes after eight out of the 18 court personnel tested positive for coronavirus. In a statement on Wednesday, Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu said that the court will be closed from today in order to allow fumigation to be carried out at the court’s premises. Mwilu said that the affected persons have immediately self-isolated pursuant to the Ministry of Health protocol. Health officers visited the court premises on Tuesday, April 6, and after the requisite assessment, recommended that the court premises be temporarily closed. They also recommended that all staff self-isolate within the period of closure, that all personnel undergo further screening for Covid19. “The closure will enable all personnel at the station to test for Covid-19 and self-isolate pursuant to Ministry of Health Covid-19 protocols, facilitate the required disinfection and fumigation exercise and contribute towards breaking the chain of transmission,” Mwilu said. She added that during the period of closure, all urgent matters for Runyenjes Law Courts will be directed to Embu and Kerugoya Law Courts. The closure comes barely a week after Karatina Law Courts in Nyeri County was temporarily closed for 10 days after one of the judiciary personnel tested positive for coronavirus. The staffer was among the 17 members in the court and was immediately isolated.
