Muslim faithful on Monday started preparations for the holy month of Ramadhan that is set to start on April 13 and will end on May 12. This comes at a time when President Uhuru Kenyatta announced a lockdown in five counties; Nairobi, Nakuru, Kiambu, Kajiado and Machakos, following high numbers of Covid-19 cases recorded. Uhuru suspended in person worship within the five counties, while for the rest of the counties, one-third of the capacity are allowed to attend. Ramadhan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting, prayer, reflection and community. A commemoration of Muhammad's first revelation, the annual observance of Ramadan is regarded as one of the five pillars of Islam and lasts 29 to 30 days, from one sighting of the crescent moon to the next. Last week, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i reiterated that only a maximum of 15 people are allowed in areas of worship for recording purposes within the five counties put under one restricted zone due to high Covid-19 cases. The restrictions were imposed for an initial 30 days. In-person worship was banned by the Inter-Faith Council on March 26 following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directives to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The Supreme Council of Muslims Kenya (SUPKEM) on Sunday asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to mobilise government resources and support the Muslim communities across the country during the holy month of Ramadhan. The Council’s acting national chairman Al Hajj Hassan ole Naado said the state, the private sector both local and international development partners of goodwill should support them especially this time the world facing the Covid-19 pandemic. Addressing the press in Narok town on Sunday, Naado expressed hopes that the government will find a way of assisting them.
