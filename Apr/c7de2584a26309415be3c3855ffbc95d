People living with HIV can breathe a sigh of relief after the government acquired ARVs following months of shortage. The Ministry of Health has confirmed that it has approved and cleared drugs from the country's suppliers and are expected to be distributed soon. In a statement on Wednesday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said the ministry has also received ARVs from other pipeline sources which are currently restocking heath facilities countrywide. "While the process is ongoing, patients will receive enough drugs for short periods at a time till regular supply is restocked," the CS said. The Ministry of Health had earlier said it directed Kenya Medical Supplies Authority to procure 1.4 million packs of ARVs which is enough to last three months for each person. The country is currently going through a distressing shortage of ARVs and most health facilities have enough drugs to last only one month. Most facilities have also run out of test kits for HIV including Dried Blood Spots (DBS) bundles, used to test for the virus in babies. The shortage particularly affects dolutegravir, the most powerful drug which Kenya adopted in 2019. Health PS Susan Mochache said ARV clinics should give clients a month's worth of ARVs until the situation normalises where patients can access three to six months' dosage.
