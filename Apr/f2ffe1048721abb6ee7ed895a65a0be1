Gor Mahia's defensive midfielder John Brystone Ochieng’ says he has now recovered fully from an ankle injury he sustained in a friendly match against Posta Rangers in November. Ochieng, who joined K'Ogalo from Chemelil during the first player transfer window, had hardly featured in any of the club's major assignments before the incident befell him. However, his fortunes appear to be on the rise given coach Vaz Pinto even included him in the matchday squad for their Football Kenya Federation Premier League encounter against Bidco United at Moi Stadium, Kasarani where they emerged a goal down to win 3-1. Ochieng’ rues having missed out on a lifetime opportunity to feature in the Caf Champions League due to the injury. “It was kind of a setback to me that I could not believe I missed Caf matches. It wasn’t my wish to stay out… I had a tough time during my injury and it was sad seeing my team struggle with different challenges but I promised never to quit,” he notes. However, he has vowed to put the setback well behind him and leave a lasting impression going forward. “My target is to make sure the club remains where it has been and I am ready to offer my very best to help the team do so.” And despite starting off the season on a torrid note, Ochieng is still convinced Gor have the potential to reclaim the title. “I see we have gelled and when the league resumes, we will surely make a massive comeback.” The 18-time FKF-PL champions are currently rooted in an unfamiliar seventh position on 22 points, 14 adrift of runaway leaders Tusker.
