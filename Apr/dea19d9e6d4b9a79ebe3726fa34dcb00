Mali diplomat Ambassador Boubacar Gaoussou Diarra, who served at the AU Special Representative for Somalia and head of Amisom from 2010-12 is dead. Maman Sambo Sidikou, the G5 Sahel executive secretary in his tribute, said Ambassador Diarra died from Covid-19 complications. In a statement on April 25, Amisom said it would remember Ambassador Diarra for working tirelessly to lay the foundation of peace, security, reconciliation and nation-building for Somalia. “It was during his tenure as head of AMISOM that Al-Shabaab was driven out of Mogadishu, and “Operation Free Shabelle” was undertaken to bring security and economic revival to greater Mogadishu and Lower Shabelle region,” Amisom said in the statement. Ambassador Francisco Madeira, the AU Special Representative for Somalia and head of Amisom, said Diarra’s footprint shall always be synonymous with counter terrorism, peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction across the continent, from Somalia to Burundi and to Mali. “We, the staff of AMISOM, honour his legacy and mourn the loss of this great son of Africa. We convey our deep-felt condolences to the family of Ambassador Diarra and the people and the government of Mali.” “Ambassador Diarra served with commitment and dedication to the AU effort in support of the people and government of Somalia and their profound aspiration for peace and security,” Ambassador Madeira said. After leaving Amisom, Diarra was appointed Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region and head of the AU Office in Bujumbura. He later went back home where he was Permanent Secretary of Central Mali’s Crisis Management Political Framework.
