Some Uasin Gishu leaders have complained that Moi University is indebted, cannot pay staff and remit deductions and want its finances investigated. The leaders said several projects to expand the university have stalled because of mismanagement and the institution is on the verge of collapse. Former Uasin Gishu assembly speaker Isaac Terer asked the government to investigate mismanagement claims at the university to save it from collapse. He spoke on behalf of the leaders. “If you look at that university in terms of structures, they are dilapidated and abandoned. Projects which were aimed at expanding facilities have stalled and if nothing is done then that institution is on the verge of collapse,” Terer said. Vice chancellor Isaac Kosgey did not pick calls or answer text messages on the issues raised about the university. Terer, a Moi University alumnus and resident of Kesses constituency where it is located, said staffers' salaries are always delayed. Casuals had not been paid for more than a year, he said. Youth leaders in Kesses led by James Kirui and Paul Bett said the university was facing serious problems. Terer said leaders in the region had supported Kosgey to take over from Professor Laban Ayiro who had steered the university in an acting capacity after Richard Mibey left. Prof Kosgey took over as VC in 2018 after some leaders in Uasin Gishu stormed the institution demanding the removal of Ayiro. The government had initially cancelled results of interviews in which Kosgey was picked over claims of graft and interference. Two weeks ago, students, accusing the university management of giving them a deaf year on important concerns, demonstrated to demand an audience with the bosses. (edited by o. owino)
