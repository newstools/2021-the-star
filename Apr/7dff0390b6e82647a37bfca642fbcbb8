All students who sat this year's KCPE exam will get their results, including those who were involved in irregularities, Education CS George Magoha has said. Speaking on Thursday during the release of KCPE results at the Knec headquarters in Nairobi, Magoha said President Uhuru Kenyatta intervened in the matter. Magoha said, "The ministry had initially decided not to release results for the involved students, but President Uhuru Kenyatta pronounced himself on the same." The CS said that five cases of impersonation were picked during the examination process, and seven candidates were found with prepared notes in exam rooms. He added that the staffers who were involved in cheating will be punished. "Centre managers, supervisors and invigilators who fiddled with administration of the exams will be punished." Magoha lauded the students for their excellent performance amid the coronavirus pandemic. He said that all the 1,179,192 students who sat for their exams will join secondary schools. Magoha said overall performance improved compared to 2019, although the mark of the highest candidate dropped from 440. The mean average performance and quality of grades for all candidates was, however, higher. In the results, female candidates performed slightly better than their male counterparts in English, Kiswahili, and Kenyan Sign Language. Male candidates performed slightly better than their female counterparts in Maths, Science, Social Studies, and Religious Education. He, however, noted that English Composition, Kiswahili Lugha, Kenyan Sign Language, Mathematics, and Religious Education recorded an improvement in performance in the year 2020 when compared to 2019.
