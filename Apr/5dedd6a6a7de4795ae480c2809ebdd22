The government through the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife has launched a nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive for frontline personnel in the Tourism and Hospitality sector. The launch which commences in Nairobi county was presided over by Tourism and Wildlife CS, Najib Balala in partnership with the Nairobi Metropolitan Services, Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers, Kenya Association of Tour Operators,  Pubs and Restaurants Association, among other stakeholders in the sector. Balala said the exercise is a major step towards the resumption of activities in the tourism sector which had been greatly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Hospitality facilities like restaurants, Hotels and Bars have been closed because of the risk posed by interaction. Therefore, this is an important step towards building confidence in the sector,” Balala said. The first phase of the program will see 5,000 workers in the hospitality sector in Nairobi County get vaccinated. Balala said the industry will be allocated a further 50,000 doses of the jab that will go into the programme. “Nairobi county has the highest number of facilities and more businesses have been affected here hence the need to first vaccinate workers," Balala said. The target personnel for the program will be those working in high contact establishments and services in the Tourism and Hospitality sector such as bars, restaurants, accommodation facilities and tour drivers. CS Balala further expressed optimism that the program is a step towards full resumption. “With this program and the continued adherence to the protocols by everyone, we can be assured that the sector will hopefully resume operations soon with minimum restrictions. This rollout of the vaccines should not be a reason to abandon the health protocols, prevention remains a critical component of the national response to the pandemic,” he said.
