A pharmacist at Rabuor hospital in Kisumu county has been arrested by the police over theft of drugs. Nyando subcounty police commander Muhanda Matete told the Star that the pharmacist was arrested on Thursday and taken to Rabuor police post. He said investigations were going on following a report that some drugs had gone missing at the facility. Last week Tuesday, Rabuor pharmacy was purportedly opened and drugs stolen. The theft mostly affected antimalarials drugs and antibiotics. The missing drugs were removed from the boxes from the hospital'sÂ  main store but there was no break in. However, a section of the staff who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity urged the police to cast their net wide, saying the drugs syndicate involves more people. Sources at the facility said some of the people in the syndicate own chemists near the hospital. "They sneak out the drugs supplied by the government to their chemists. Even bed nets given to the facility find their way to local trading centre where they are sold," the source said. The hospital's administrator, the pharmacy in charge and the county director of health Dr Fred Oluoch declined to comment on the matter. The subcounty police commander however told the Star that legal action will be taken against those involved in the drugs syndicate once investigations are complete. In 2019, the hospital is said to have approved construction of staff and patients toilets. Only one was constructed. "As we speak, there are only two toilets being shared by staff and patients, one of which is about to collapse," the source said. "The autoclave machine is not working, patients go hungry and the administration claims that there is no allocation for food," the source said.
