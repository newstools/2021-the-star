Sofapaka midfielder Mohamed Kilume has voiced his desire to wear the national colours and represent Kenya in international tournaments. “Every player always wants to play at the very top and the national team is one such level. I have been unlucky when it comes to the national team," he said. "I haven’t been able to represent the nation at any level. Nevertheless, it remains my one main target to achieve. Playing for the country comes with advantages. It builds one’s curriculum vitae and positions one to opportunities out of the country. "I hope to someday don the Harambee Stars' colours and demonstrate what I am capable of doing,” he said. Kilume recounted on the club's official portal his early career frustrations that drove him from the slums of Majengo, Nairobi to play football on the national stage. "Watching my former teammates making it through to higher levels made me rethink my decision on football," he said. The 23-year-old continued: "I wanted a good life and had hoped my talent would help me get a breakthrough. Sadly this wasn’t the case neither was it forthcoming. "This got me frustrated and I decided to quit football and shifted focus on other handy jobs to at least get some income. "After a while, I started noticing my former teammates making strides in the lower league and top-tier leagues. "They were beginning to make a living out of it and this made me have deep thoughts. I changed my perception and decided to struggle my way back humbly but so determined and focused to make it through." The Sofapaka vice-captain credits teammate Brian Magonya and former coach Sam Ssibwa for playing pivotal roles in his career thus far. This season 'Batoto Ba Mungu' have failed to live up to the expectations of many who saw them as a real contender for the Premier League title. Instead, they have fallen way out of the title race and were in 11th place before the topflight season was suspended.
