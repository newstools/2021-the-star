A man charged with assaulting his wife on Wednesday defended his actions saying the spouse had attempted to curse him. Collins Mudaida, who pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife for serving him too much sukuma wiki,  told Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto that he beat up Mercy Kegehi after she contravened the Luhya culture and cursed him and his generation. “She removed her clothes, then held my child on her laps and told me that I will never get a woman pregnant,” he said, adding: "She also sat on my bed and table naked saying that my generation was completely over." “I only beat her because she cursed my generation my honour, you know very well what the Luhya culture entails,” he added. But the magistrate told the suspect off and asked him to stop generalising the community in the case. “Mr accused just stop that, don’t say Luhyas in this matter because you are very wrong,” Kuto said. Court prosecutor Nancy Kerubo said the accused was angry after his wife questioned him about having another wife. She told the court that the accused had arrived home late that day before he was served ugali and Sukuma wiki. But he became quarrelsome asking why he has been served too much sukuma wiki before throwing the plate of food down. “He came home late and the complainant gave him food. He complained of being served with too much sukuma wiki and in response the wife told him he had not bought any food in the house,” Kerubo said. The charge sheet reads that the accused committed the offence on April 1 at about 9pm in Kangemi, Nairobi county. Kuto directed that the matter be mentioned on Friday for sentencing after the prosecution brings to court a probation report.  -Edited by SKanyara
