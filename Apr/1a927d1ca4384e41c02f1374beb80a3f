Education CS George Magoha on Wednesday launched  the marking of the KCSE examination papers after the last paper was done on Wednesday. During a press briefing at Nairobi School, he said this will be a meticulous process that will be conducted by experienced examiners. "We are all determined to ensure grades awarded to our learners are all merited and that our academic qualifications are beyond reproach," Magoha said. The CS said that over the examination period, the Ministry experienced a number of cases where examination officials attempted to open the papers with the intention of exposing them to candidates before the actual examinations started. "We thwarted these efforts in a few centres countrywide, some of which I released to you during my weekly briefs. In all, I can confidently announce to the country that none of the 2020 KCSE Examination papers was leaked, save for the unethical early exposure of questions, which was firmly dealt with and did not benefit any of the candidates," Magoha said. He also stated that a total of 27 officials were relieved of their various duties as center managers, supervisors or invigilators over allegations of violating regulations guiding the administration of examinations. Adding that as a Ministry, they we will be presenting the list of teachers believed to be behind some of the examination offences to the TSC for action. 37 civilians, including three university students and two businessmen, were arrested for attempting to engage (or assist) in examination irregularities. In terms of gadgets sneaked in school, 37 mobile phones were confiscated from candidates at examination rooms during the exercise. Magoha added that security agencies are busy conducting thorough forensic investigations to find out if the gadgets were used to aid any form of cheating.
