Communities living around Lake Naivasha have been urged to move to safer ground as the water body is likely to flood. The meteorological department has warned of heavy rain in the coming days The flood alert comes as families that had been displaced by rising waters in Kihoto estate return to their homes after the levels went down. The warning was issued by Kenya Red Cross and Lake Naivasha Water Resource Users Association. They warned that indications show the projected rains could cause floods. “This is to request you to move to higher grounds once the water levels start rising,” Red Cross said in a message put out in Kiswahili. LANAWRUA chairman Enock Kiminta said the lake’s levels had dropped from 1891.56m above sea level last year to 1891.10m. “When the water levels dropped some families whose houses had been flooded decided to return and we are worried by the move,” he said on Wednesday. Kiminta said going by the weatherman’s projections, the rains could be heavier and could cause more displacement than last year. “We have seen water levels in the lake drop sharply in the last three months but this should not be a reason for those displaced to return to their houses,” he said. Kiminta said the fuel pipeline in Kihoto had been flooded raising fears among residents and environmentalists. “Water from this lake is very corrosive and we fear that it might have effects on the metallic underground pipes that ferry millions of litres of fuel every day,” he said. However, a senior officer from Kenya Pipeline Company downplayed any leaking fears, saying the pipeline had been built to withstand weather changes. “It’s true the fuel pipeline is currently under water but studies indicate that it has a lifespan of over 20 years before the water can have any effects on the materials,” said the officer who declined to be named.
