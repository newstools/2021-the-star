Neither ODM leader Raila Odinga nor Deputy President William Ruto have plans of forming an alliance as 2022 politics hot up. “...we have never had and are not planning to have a conversation towards forming a political alliance with ODM... We in the hustler nation believe that the only credible competitor we have in the country is Raila Odinga,”  Elegeyo Marakwet Senator and Ruto's ally Kipchumba Murkomen said. He said Ruto was willing to work with those who will support his presidential bid. The senator spoke during an interview with Citizen TV on Tuesday night. ODM chairman John Mbadi echoed Murkomen's sentiments, saying, "We are not in any talks with anyone... Our focus is on BBI." Murkomen likened a collaboration between Raila and Ruto to that of the US's Democratic party partnering with the Republican party, saying it cannot work. The comments come as Ruto last month hinted at being willing to work with Raila. Ruto, in an interview with Radio Citizen, said he is ready and willing to work with all like-minded politicians who share his dream for the country. “Anybody who wants to join us to fight poverty and other things that ail the country is welcome,” Ruto stated. He added that if Raila agrees with his manifesto and his belief that poverty should be fought from the bottom to the top, they could work together. “We have our plans, if he believes in us, we will agree and work together,” the Deputy President added. However, Ruto has dismissed reports of ongoing talks between him and Raila to forge a pre-election deal. On Monday, Ruto's office said the DP has neither met Raila’s emissaries nor sent people to negotiate any political deal. Ruto’s director of communication Emmanuel Talam told the Star that the meeting between Ruto and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya had nothing to do with Raila.
