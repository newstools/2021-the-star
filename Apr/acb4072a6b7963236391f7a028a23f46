The Nyeri county government has waived levies paid by traders to cushion them from the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The move followed last week's lockdown imposed on five 'disease infested' counties of Kiambu, Nakuru, Kajiado, Machakos and Nairobi. Governor Mutahi Kahiga on Friday said the lockdown had limited trade in the Central Kenya county. He also extended deadlines for payment of other county charges. The transport industry is among the sectors that benefited from the waiver with Kahiga announcing a 50 pe rcent waiver on levies paid by public service vehicles. The waivers will remain in force until the lockdown is lifted. “We are also going to give a 50 per cent waiver of all monthly market banda fees up to April 30 and if this situation prevails, we shall continue looking at how to extend it,” Kahiga said. There will also a be 100 per cent waiver on all accrued penalties for owners of county government shops, stalls and houses. Also extended is the deadline for payment of all land rates and business permits up to April 30. A 25 per cent waiver was also announced for liquor license fees until June 30. Kahiga said the safety protocols issued by President Uhuru Kenyatta would adversely affect small traders and the transport industry. He urged for compliance with the protocols to curb the spread of Covid-19. “It is important that we also observe all public health guidelines on Covid-19 containment measures,” he said. The governor spoke at a press briefing at his residence in Nyeri town.  Edited by P.O
