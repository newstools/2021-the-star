Boxing Federation of Kenya have been exonerated from blame over the deplorable living conditions of former boxing stars. Speaking on Thursday, BFK communications director, Duncan Kuria lashed out at the former boxers for failing put their house in order when they had the  opportunity to do so. “Most of them failed to plan well enough for their lives after retirement. They got absorbed by fame but that gradually faded away leading them to depression and a host of social challenges. “We have engaged our current crop of boxers and impressed upon them to embrace education if they are to acquire some extra survival skills. "The federation has also decided to work closely with financial management specialists, therapists and psychologists going forward,” Kuria added. Kuria jumped to the defence of the federation, saying they have absolutely nothing to do with the challenges bedevilling the pugilists once they step out of the ring and hang their up gloves. Kuria said they were unfairly being criticised in instances where former boxers encounter difficulties in life after bowing out of the sport. “Some of them excelled as amateur boxers but experienced challenges when they turned professional. "There is very little we can do to salvage their situation given professional boxing is outside our mandate. “In professional boxing, boxers are handled by a boxing commission and only agents and promoters decide the competitions they will participate in.” Responding to claims BFK did very little or nothing at all to address the plight of ex-Kenyan boxers such as Ibrahim Bilali and Stephen Muchoki who are purportedly languishing in abject poverty, Kuria said BFK was being limited by financial constraints. “At the moment we have a big challenge in securing enough sponsors; you'll appreciate the fact that we can only deal with some of those cases effectively if we have enough money to support them financially," said Kuria.
