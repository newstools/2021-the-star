A body has been found dumped in Governor's camp near the Mai Mahiu IDP settlement—the sixth such discovery in two months. Residents, some of whom are former IDPs, said they were concerned that the area had been turned into a dump for bodies. Peter Musa said the body was disposed of at the scene in the wee hours of the morning. It was raining and the car that dropped it sped off. The body, dressed in smart clothing, had a deep wound in the back of the head. “We are now living in fear and are suspicious of any new car as this area has been turned into a dumping field for bodies murdered elsewhere,” he said. Naivasha division police boss Samuel Waweru said initial investigations indicated that the victim died from back-head injuries. “The body has been collected and taken to area mortuary awaiting identification and it’s obvious the murder was committed elsewhere,” Waweru said. Jikaze IDP camp chair Mohamed Maina said some of the bodies recovered in the past had decomposed. He termed it normal for them to stumble on bodies every month. “We believe these bodies are ferried from different locations in the country and dumped here, along this busy highway used by heavy commercial vehicles,” he said. Resident Christine Ndinda called on the government to investigate the incidents, saying many of the former IDPs were living in fear. “Most of these bodies are found by children going to school and this is traumatising and we should be told who is doing all this,” she said.
