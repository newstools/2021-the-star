The Kirinyaga government has extended the payment deadline for single business permits and liquor licences to May 15. This is in a bid to cushion the business community from the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. “This is due to the surge of the deadly Covid-19 and adverse effects the pandemic has had on the economy," Governor Anne Waiguru said. The county offered a 25 per cent waiver on single business permits and liquor licence fees for this year. In a statement released on Friday, it also included a 100 per cent waiver of fees for persons in the hospitality industry applying for medical certificates. Also wholly waived are accumulated interest and penalties on land rates and rent for 30 days starting from Thursday this week. The county also offered a 100 per cent waiver on matatu parking fees for the month of April for PSV operators registered with the county government. Market access fees have also been fully waived for 30 days starting Thursday this week. “The war against the coronavirus is still on, hence I urge all Kirinyaga residents to continue observing the safety measures laid down,” Waiguru said.
