The Court of Appeal will on Tuesday morning give its ruling on whether the Supreme Court judge Interviews will proceed or not. The three judges were expected to give the ruling at 3 pm on Monday, however, judge Roselyne Nambuye said it was not ready. The court had in the morning heard the appeal filed by the JSC and AG challenging the orders halting the Chief Justice recruitment. The appellate judges who heard the case are justices Nambuye, Patrick Kiage and Sankale Ole Kantai. The commission is seeking to suspend the orders issued by the High Court last week halting the recruitment. On Friday, JSC chair Prof Olive Mugenda said the commission would not conductÂ  interviews for Supreme Court judge that were scheduled for this week because of the orders. The commission has also been barred from deliberating on the suitability of the 10 candidates interviewed for CJ position. On Monday, justices Juma Chitembwe and Martha Koome were to be interviewed for the position Supreme Court judge. JSC argues that if the orders are not set aside there will be a legal vacuum especially on the process of recruiting the Chief Justice. The four petitioners on their part challenge Mugenda position as chair of the commission during the interview. They further claim that commissioner Paul Gichuhi retired from public service and is illegally sitting in the commission.
