Somali Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble has ordered all election stakeholders to prepare for a national election. In a statement seen by the Star, the Prime Minister said no one should attempt to jeopardize the efforts of setting up the elections. Somalia’s parliamentary and presidential elections have been held up for months because of disputes over the electoral process. The PM called on other Federal member states of Puntland, Jubbaland, Southwest and Banadir region to fully commit to a peaceful process in efforts to hold a free and inclusive election. He also welcomed the press statements made by Galmudug and Hirshabelle Federal Member States which also want polls to be conducted based on the 17th September agreement. "I call on the political opposition leaders to cease all hostilities and actions that can blunder this country into unintended consequences and to stay at their locations," Roble said. He also instructed all military to "duly submit themselves to their constitutional responsibilities and to safeguard the national security." "I instruct the force commanders to pull back forces to their locations and barracks," he said. Roble called upon Somali people to support peace-building and security efforts in the country. There have bee reports of overnight clashes in the capital between backers and opponents of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, known as “Farmajo.” Analysts worry the political stand-off over parliament’s term extension for Farmajo could quickly turn into an armed conflict. According to Somalia media, clashes were reported at the home of opposition Wadajir party leader Abdulrahman Abdishakur, and at the home of former President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.
