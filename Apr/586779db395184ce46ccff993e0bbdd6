American entrepreneur Anne Wojcicki once said the only way change comes is when you lead by example. And when Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi wrote and shared his experience with Covid-19, he clearly led by example, informing Kenyans how bad the virus is. Being a politician, he was humble enough to tell the world about his most vulnerable experience so that others who might not take the virus seriously learn from his experience. He did not only share the terrible effect the virus had on him but also how some of the decisions he made such as not seeking immediate medical attention and opting to self medicate contributed to his worsening situation. Many have contracted the virus and gotten well but not a single politician did a noble thing of letting Kenyans in on their experiences so that the masses can glean a thing or two. It is for this reason that Kiraitu deserves a commendation. As Kenyans, we should also take lessons from Governor Murungi's experience such as putting family first, paying attention when the body refuses to work and taking good care of our health. Life should not be wasted but lived well and deliberately.
