Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has urged Kenyans to embrace domestic tourism to build the country. Speaking on Saturday in Machakos as he flagged off the Tembea Tujenge Kenya caravan, Mutua said the country should not continue depending on foreigners for tourism. “As a country, we need to have a mindset as if Kenya was in the middle of the ocean with no countries around us and we can take care of our own business,” he said. “That way, we can support our industries and everything else. When we support our travel industry, we support it ourselves.” Mutua said Kenya is beautiful with various sites to visit for domestic tourism. The sites are also ideal for corporate tourism, team building and adventure. “There is something for you to do with your family. Don’t wait for that mzungu to come from the US to tour the country. Go round and tour your country, we build Kenya together,” he said. Mutua said it was important for Kenyans to walk the talk. “Tembea Kenya, jenga Kenya. We need to walk the talk. Some people say buy Kenya, build Kenya but they neither buy nor build Kenya.” He said Kenyans need to have confidence in themselves and know that they are capable of doing these things. “We can get quality things in Kenya and promote the jua kali sector. We should cease being a country with very few rich people and buy Kenya, build Kenya as we move on as a people,” Mutua said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
