Sofapaka president Elly Kalekwa has come to the rescue of ailing youth midfielder Wisdom Naya. Naya was recently diagnosed with a cancerous soft tissue sarcoma that requires urgent medical attention. The St. Anthony's Kitale alumnus joined the senior team at the beginning of the 2019/2020 season but was later redeployed to the junior team. His condition was brought to public attention after local football enthusiasts and friends launched a spirited social media campaign to raise money for his treatment. But Kalekwa said on Wednesday he was going to rally well-wishers behind Naya in a show of solidarity. “I was moved by Wisdom’s condition and as family, we have resolved to be involved in his treatment. “We are going to organise ourselves in the next few days together with our partners and friends to ensure that Wisdom gets the necessary support on his medical expenses.” “My sincere gratitude goes out to all those who have contributed towards Naya’s treatment. “It’s a gesture of kindness, together with their contributions we as a club and our sponsor will chip in to help Naya receive full treatment,” said Kalekwa. Naya said he was delighted and relieved after receiving news that his club would chip in, adding he was in constant communication with Kalekwa. “I am so happy today talking to the club president for coming through at a moment when am really in need. “He is very remorseful for what has been going through and he has assured me of his total support until I get back to my feet.”
