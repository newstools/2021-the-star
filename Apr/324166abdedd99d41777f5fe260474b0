A Kisumu court on Wednesday quashed the decision by Siaya MCAs to remove Isaac Olwero from his clerk position in 2019. The court declared the process illegal and reinstated Olwero. Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Francis Radido quashed a decision by the assembly to suspend and remove Olwero from the office on March 1, 2019. The suspended clerk moved to court challenging the suspension on account of irregular access to a car loan. The assembly accused Olwero of irregularly acquiring a car loan amounting to Sh2 million in 2015. However, the judge set aside the proceedings of the assembly service board on the said allegations. According to the judgement, Olwero was reinstated as the bona fide and legal clerk to the assembly. Following the  suspension,  in accordance with the provisions of the assembly service Act, the assembly service board assigned Erick Ogenga to perform the duties of the assembly clerk in acting capacity. In the petition, Olwero was represented by  Rogo , Okelo , Wangari and Company Advocates while  and the assembly was represented by Ogola and Kemboi Company Advocates. Ogola requested for stay orders which the judge declined. Olwero urged the service board to respect the judgement and to allow for smooth operations. "I pedge to be faithful to the board and do my work diligently in service to the members of the assembly and the great people of Siaya as I have always done for the last five years as the clerk," he said.
