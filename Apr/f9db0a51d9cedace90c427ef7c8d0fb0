A police officer's earlobe was bitten off by a woman after they fought over curfew restrictions along the Southern Bypass in Langata, Nairobi. Nairobi, Kiambu, Kajiado, Machakos and Nakuru counties have been put on lockdown and stricter curfew hours that start from 8pm. The move followed increased cases of Covid-19 infections. President Uhuru Kenyatta while ordering the cessation of movement declared the five counties 'disease infested zone.' Curfew in the rest of the counties starts at 10pm. In Langata, the police officer said he stopped the woman on Saturday, prompting an argument. It was minutes past 8pm. The woman jumped on the officer, held his head and bit off his right earlobe. She then ran towards Kibera slums as the officer groaned in pain. The officer told his seniors that he picked the bitten parts from the ground and sought help. He was admitted to the Nairobi West Hospital where the earlobe was reattached after surgery. The officer said the woman was a stranger to him. Nairobi police boss Augustine Ntumbi said they are investigating the motive of the attack. No arrest has been made so far. Over the weekend, more than 600 people were arrested and detained in various police stations as police enforced curfew orders. The offenders were granted police bonds. They are expected in court on Tuesday. Police said most of the victims were arrested outside joints while others were found on the roads. The curfew and partial lockdown are supposed to run for 30 days from March 29.
