The much awaited technical cooperation between Kenya and Cuba has come to fruition, Health CAS Rashid Aman said. During a press conference at Afya House to mark World Malaria Day, Aman said that the Cuban experts will be working with Kenyan counterparts to map out key breeding sites for spraying using biological methods to kill mosquito larvae. "Through this project, we shall gain from the technological application of biolarvicides in the control of malaria causing mosquitoes," Aman said. In 2019, Kenya and Cuba finalized negotiations on a Malaria Vector Control project to be implemented in the malaria prone areas in the country. The agreement was for both countries to undertake a two year joint project on the use of biologicalÂ methods for the control of mosquito vectors. This malaria vector control project targets eight malaria endemic counties in the Lake region; Kisumu, Siaya, Busia, Vihiga, Migori, Homa bay, Bungoma and Kakamega. In line with President Uhuru Kenyatta's call to ensure the involvement of the youth in malaria control efforts, Aman said that youth from eight counties will be involved in the project for sustainability. "Our plan as per our Primary Health care guidelines is not to wait for the disease to occur but to effectively prevent it from occurring in the first place. We must expand our outreach in affected communities to spread knowledge on the protection of individuals and families against malaria," the CAS said. Aman pointed out that according to the Kenya Malaria Indicator Survey, the overall prevalence of Malaria has reduced from 8% documented in 2015 to 5.6%. The Lake region which bears the highest disease burden has reduced its prevalence rate from 27% to 19%. The Coast region has also seen a drop in prevalence rates from 8% to 4.5%.
