Media personality Terryanne Chebet has opened up about raising daughters as a single mum. Speaking to Massawe Japanni on Radio Jambo, the mother of two said she finds it easy to raise her daughters alone as she has always been a single mother. Her firstborn daughter is 15 years and the second-born daughter is three years. "Being a single mum is something I have always been and so it comes naturally and I do not know how not to be. That is one of the challenges that I always tell myself, nitaweza kweli kuwa bibi mzuri wa kukaa nyumbani?" "I would like to be a wife but I am so used to being on my own and being independent and doing things my way. Knowing my place and depending on my own decisions." Asked about the huge gap between her two daughters, Terryanne said she had decided she did not want another child until when her firstborn daughter got 10 years and she felt that by the time she is 18 years, she will leave the house and Terryanne will be left all alone. Speaking about her baby daddies. Terryanne said they are responsible. "When my daughter turned 11 years, I used to feel like she hates me. She was completely different. I realised that I needed her dad more in her life than ever before. That is exactly what I did." Terryanne added that she made her daughter comfortable with her dadâ€™s family and that helped her. She is currently very free with her mum. "I think the more people you have in life, godmother, aunts... Girls need as many influencers around them as a teenager," she said. "That is what exactly I did by involving his family side to feel she is in a family so she knows that if she lets me down, she lets everyone down. Talking to her as much as possible and now she is very comfortable with me. "She is turning 15 years and it is not easy, as the mother you have to keep talking to her. You should make her comfortable to talk to you."
