World men's marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge is back in Kenya after his win in the Netherlands. Kipchoge set his sights on a second Olympic gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics after a win at the NN Mission Marathon in Enschede in the Netherlands last week. Kipchoge was competing for the first time after a disappointing eighth-place finish at the London Marathon in October last year. The Olympics marathon champion clocked 2:04:30 to finish first ahead of training partner Jonathan Korir, who timed second in 2:06:40 with Eritrean Goitom Kifle ,  third in 2:08:00. Via Twitter on Monday, Kipchoge said he is ready to train for the next marathon. “I am back in Kenya after a great race in The Netherlands. Now it's time for recovery work before we start training again,” he said. Kipchoge is part of the four-man team named by Athletics Kenya to lead the country's charge for a podium finish at the Olympics. Other members of the team include Boston Marathon champion Lawrence Cherono, Vincent Kipchumba and world marathon bronze medalist Amos Kipruto.
