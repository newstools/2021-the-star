Harambee Stars head coach Jacob Ghost Mulee has caused a stir after posting a photo that captured him recuperating in the hospital. Ghost took to his social media platforms to assure his fans all was well with him after he underwent a procedure whose details still remain scanty. “We thank God for a successful procedure. Well taken care of! Undugu ni kufaana si kufanana. ” read his Instagram post. According to sources, the 52-year-old tactician reportedly was flown to India three weeks ago for an organ transplant. Last October, he was involved in a nasty car crash along Brookside Drive on Waiyaki Way but there is nothing much yet to link his hospitalization with the incident. Mulee took charge of the national team following the acrimonious exit of former head coach Francis Kimanzi. He first struggled to impress his bosses after registering consecutive unimpressive results against the Comoros Islands in the African Cup of Nations qualifiers where they drew 1-1 in Nairobi before falling 2-1 in Moroni. He would later redeem himself following a one-all draw against the much-fancied Pharaohs of Egypt and later, a convincing 2-1 win over Togo in Lome.
