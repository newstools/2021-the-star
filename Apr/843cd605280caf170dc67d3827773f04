A man hanged himself in his house on Thursday in Lamu Island’s Wiyoni area following a domestic quarrel with his wife. Fisherman Abdul Kassim's body was discovered dangling from the roof of the house he shared with his wife and three children. His wife left their matrimonial home for her parent’s house after the two had a quarrel on Wednesday. She went with the children. Neighbour Omar Ali said the couple had had endless fights and quarrels. “We are used to their fights and quarrels but never once did we ever imagine he would kill himself over it. The wife left on Wednesday and when we didn’t see him on Thursday, we went knocking on his door only to find he has committed suicide," Ali said. Chief Farah Jelle said the man should have used other means to try and resolve the issue with his wife instead of suicide. “There are elders and religious leaders who can always come in handy during such times. My office has successfully resolved such issues," Jelle said. Lamu county police commander Moses Murithi confirmed the incident. “We are however investigating to rule out any foul play," Murithi said. The body has been taken to the King Fahad hospital mortuary. The Lamu council of elders has raised concerns over increased cases of suicide in the region. They blamed the situation partly on the tough economic times caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
