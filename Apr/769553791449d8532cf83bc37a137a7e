There are several approaches one may use to sell or lease a property that people find unattractive because of a bad reputation. If a property has a very bad name in a certain locality, probably because of the nasty things that happened there some time back, you may have to give people who knew about the events time to heal. As they say, time is a healer. The community around that property will need time to get over the incident. It may take three months, four months or even a bit longer for it to get out of their minds and then they will be ready to occupy the property. Another way of dealing with such situations is to change use of the property. I have seen this work in very many places. For example, if a property was a residential building, you may change to commercial use. Another way is just to put it out there in the market. People from outside usually do not care so much about what happened on a particular property before. I will use the example of the coast region. There, you may encounter cases whereby locals shy away from occupying a property because it is allegedly infested with spirits or genies. You will, however, wonder why the genies will never bother a white man from Europe who buys the property. It is usually because of superstitions. Do you want to tell me that because a person was killed at a particular spot on a street, people should start using other roads? People die in road accidents and the vehicles are repaired and sold. There are people who work in the morgues for years and that is their livelihood. People should not be so much superstitious. When a family member dies, people do not stay away from that house. Properties are meant to last for even 100 years, but human beings do not. We also do some rehabilitation to these properties to attract customers. We may put a fresh paint and do some modifications to make the properties modern and attractive.  Mwenda Thuranira, the founder and CEO of MySpace Properties spoke to the Star
