There are concerns about accessing the next consignment of vaccines due to the export restrictions placed by India on the AstraZeneca vaccine. The government has said plans are in place to ensure that all those who have received the first dose of the vaccine get the second without delay. Head of national vaccines and immunisation programme Dr Collins Tabu said the government is trying to fully administer all the doses available before their expiration date. “We want to reach as many people within the priority groups as quickly as possible with at least one dose and then follow up with the second dose to complete the two dose schedule,” Tabu said. Covid-19 vaccines have short expiry dates of between three and six months. “For now we do know that the supply is interrupted because of global supply and demand issues but we can say that this will be sorted out in the near future so we want to achieve the maximum throughput for these vaccines that we have and so that we don’t waste even a single dose,” Tabu said. He said the first dose is as equally protective as the second dose. “We should count ourselves lucky that even with the one dose of Covid-19 vaccines you are protected to an upwards of 76 per cent until you receive the second dose so we shouldn’t be wary and we can’t get the first dose when I am not assured of the second dose,” Tabu said. Tabu said the government is monitoring and engaging to schedule the shipments such that Kenyans are within time to receive the second dose of the vaccine within the eight to 12 weeks interval.
