Kayole Starlets captain Sharon Miloya says footballers who have families to take care of, are experiencing the most brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic. Miloya is now urging the government to expedite the resumption of competition to ease off the burden. “At the moment, we are not on the pitch. We are parents and our children are having it rough given we are financially stuck due to inactivity in the league. “If the government could have lifted the ban on sporting activities, we wouldn't be experiencing any of these challenges.” Her sentiments were shared by Gaspo Rangers skipper Winnie Kanyotu who pointed out that the government's directive had crippled a huge number of Kenyan footballers who mostly rely on the sport as the sole means of livelihood. “Football is everything to us. My appeal to the government is they should consider lifting the ban they recently imposed. Their observations came even as Football Kenya Federation spearheaded a rigorous Covid-19 vaccination exercise in partnership with the ministries of health and sports. A good number of teams, however, missed out on the jab as it became apparent government stores had run out of the vaccine. On March 25, President Uhuru Kenyatta imposed a ban on sporting activities in a frantic bid to contain the spread of the third wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
