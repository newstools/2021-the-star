Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru on Wednesday disbursed Sh3,081,000 bursaries to assist needy students. Out of the kitty, Sh1,615,000 went to secondary school students, Sh990,500 to university students and Sh475,500 to students in tertiary institutions. The Sh3 million is an addition to the Sh110 million issued earlier this year. While issuing the bursary cheques to beneficiaries, the governor said the funds would benefit 179 secondary school students, universities (50) and colleges (22). Beneficiaries in secondary schools were awarded between Sh5,000 and Sh10,000, while university and college students got between Sh15,000 and Sh30,000 depending on the need of the student. Waiguru said the fund is aimed at enabling students from poor backgrounds to get an education. She noted that the disbursement was in addition to the Sh110 million bursaries given to about 40,000 students earlier in the year. “My government remains committed to supporting the education of our children, the improvement of academic performance in our county and ultimately, the lives of our youth,” she said. The governor also appealed to residents to strictly adhere to Covid-19 prevention measures such as wearing of masks, regular washing of hands, and observing social distance. Waiguru said the county has registered 530 Covid-19 cases since the outbreak of the pandemic, with 436 patients successfully recovering from home-based care and 24 recovering in isolation centres. Currently, four patients are undergoing treatment in isolation centres, while another 27 are recovering under home-based care. The county has lost nine people to the disease, two of them during the current wave. The governor said the county had on Wednesday received an additional 6,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine, making a total of 11,000 doses that the county has received so far. About 4,500 people, including health workers, police officers, teachers and people aged 58 years and above, have already received the vaccine. The governor urged the elderly as well as people with underlying conditions to visit the nearest designated vaccination centre for the jab. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
