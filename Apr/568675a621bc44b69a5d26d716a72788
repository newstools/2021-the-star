The High Court has extended orders barring the Nairobi City County Government from increasing parking fees for private cars and public service vehicles from Sh200 to 400. Justice Anthony Mrima has ordered that NMS be enjoined in the case as an Interested Party. The judge ordered a mention date of May 3, 2021, to allow parties to file submissions and for further directions. In March the judge also extended orders. Through Lawyer Henry Kurauka, Cofek and the Matatu Owners Association argued that the increment of fees was unfair, unreasonable, exorbitant and lacked public participation in accordance with Article 10 of the Constitution. The new charges were to come into effect on December 4, 2020. City Hall issued a public notice dated December 2, last year increasing the fees from the current Sh200 to Sh400. Buses that are not public service vehicles were to pay Sh1,000 daily. The notice was signed by county parking services director Tom Tinega. Cofek protested the decision arguing it would hurt consumers seeking transport and parking services within the area.
