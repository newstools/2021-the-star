The body of a senior official at the US embassy in Nairobi was found hanging in his hotel room after an apparent suicide. Police and witnesses said the body of the official aged 58 was found in his room hours after he had failed to report to work Wednesday morning. The man who was said to be the second-in-command in security at the embassy was alone in his room at the hotel near the Village Market when the incident happened. Witnesses said he used his belt to commit suicide. “The body was found hanging near the room window. He seemed to have died long before security arrived there,” said a police officer who went to the scene. The deceased was supposed to relieve a colleague at the embassy but failed to show up. Calls to his mobile phone were not being responded to forcing the embassy staff to go check on him. It was then that they found his body. The officials broke into the hotel room and found a suicide note next to the bed. It will be subjected to examination to establish if he was the author. A US Embassy Nairobi spokesperson said the next of kin had not been informed and asked that his identity be hidden. “We can confirm the death of a US government employee. US Embassy Nairobi extends its deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of the deceased.” said US Embassy spokesperson. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
