Two petitions have been filed before the High Court seeking to bar JSC commissioners Olive Mugenda and Patrick Gichuhi from the commission. Philip Muchiri, Damaris Ndirangu and Samuel Wanjiru claim their petitions disclose sufficient grounds for the commissioners removal. This comes less than a week before the Judicial Service Commission will embark on the exercise of interviewing candidates for the new Chief Justice. Mugenda has been accused of serving in two distinct state office positions warranting her removal from the JSC. She chairs the board of Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral & Research Hospital and is also a member of the Commission which, according to the petitioners is unconstitutional. In a separate petition, commissioner Gichuhi was accused of illegally representing the Public Service Commission (PSC) at the JSC even after her ouster on January 8, 2019. "... he is not qualified to be the representative of the Public Service Commission on the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) but he continues masquerading as such," the petition read in part. Meanwhile, ten candidates have been shortlisted for the position of Chief Justice (CJ) ahead of their interviews in April. They include Justice Said Chitembwe, Prof Patricia Mbote, Justice Martha Koome, Justice Marete Njagi, Philip Murgor, Justice Nduma Nderi, Fred Ngatia, Justice William Ouko, Dr Wekesa Moni, and Alice Yano. Those shortlisted for the Supreme Court judge position include; Justice Said Chitembwe, Justice Martha Koome, Justice M’inoti Kathurima, Justice Nduma Nderi, Lumumba Nyaberi, Justice William Ouko, Justice Joseph Sergon and Alice Yano.
