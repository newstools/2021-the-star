Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has said 33 roadblocks have been erected on all major roads leading into and out of zoned areas. A total of 3,000 prison warders have also been deployed. This is to ensure that Kenyans in those areas do no leave during the Easter holiday season which begins on April 2, 2021. "...These roadblocks will be maned day and night to ensure total compliance with the presidents directives," he said. Nairobi, Kajiado, Kiambu, Nakuru and Machakos counties have been zoned as a block and entry and exit is prohibited. "The curfew prescribed to zoned areas shall remain until further notice. We commit to being human as we discharge our mandate," he said. Addressing the media on Thursday, Mutyambai said this will ensure the safety of everyone during this Easter season. "As we speak, commissioner general for prisons has released 3,000 officers to provide security during this season," he said. Mutyambai said police officers need to speak to Kenyans with a soft approach instead of a hard one. "Soft approach is more appropriate so that we can fight this disease. Kenyans should report cases of people going against MOH protocols," he said. He urged the zoned counties to exercise caution and remain within except for essential service providers who can crisscross the areas. Easter holidays were thrown into limbo with presidential directives hindering travel in five counties. In-person worshipping was suspended until further notice over a surge in virus cases. Christians usually celebrate Easter by going to church and travelling, but the pandemic has changed things. The holidays would usually have Kenyans pile into crowded buses to return to their family homes in rural areas. The Interfaith Council led by Anthony Muheria in a statement last Saturday affirmed the presidential directive saying that it would affect the Easter celebrations.
