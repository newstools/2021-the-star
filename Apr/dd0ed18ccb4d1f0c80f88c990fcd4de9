Mash Mwana is mourning the death of his father James Mamayo. The 65-year-old died last week at the Shalom Hospital, Athi River. He succumbed to Covid-19 and was buried over the weekend. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, the gospel singer said his father died before he could see his son's family. "He was a very strong believer. All the time, Mzee wanted to see me at a good place, settled with a wife; he wanted grandkids. He passed at a time when I hadn't done the things he had wanted me to do. I got hurt," he said. The 'Hatachelewa' hitmaker was going through tough times even before his father's death. "I was the last person to see him. The last time I went to visit him, I got an accident, I was hit by a boda boda guy. I had to take the boda boda guy to the same hospital, so I had two patients there," he said. "Learning of his death was very painful. I was going through a lot and I had bills to pay." Mash Mwana was left with a Sh500,000 hospital bill, which he was helped by friends to settle. "It is good to stay well with people. When my dad passed, I called my pastor, my friend Sam, Masterpeice and DK Kwenye Beat since they are my closest friends. They came to the hospital with more friends." Among other celebrities who held Mwana's hand during the tough times were Bahati, Mr Seed, DJ Mo, Teddy B and Jalang'o. "They stood with me. I saw God, because I wasn't left with any bill. We settled everything." The singer hopes to make his mother proud. "He was the only person I could say was staying with my mother every day. I was asking myself, who will my mother stay with?" "I want to support my mum, be there for her, show her love and bring her a wife and kids very soon."
