On Thursday 8, Milimani senior resident magistrate Jane Kamau released activist Edwin Mutemi Kiama on Sh500,000 bail pending completion of investigations. Kiama was arraigned following the wide circulation of an anti-IMF loan to Kenya poster of President Uhuru Kenyatta. A day after the ruling,  six human rights groups have come out to condemn the ruling, terming it as exorbitant, unjustifiable, and unaffordable. In a press address on Thursday, the groups said the magistrate dismissed the application by the prosecution during the bail ruling. “We will not surrender our vigilance and acts of resistance however punitive your bails will be. We will not be silenced from pointing out dehumanising ideologies of totalitarian capitalism that borrows beyond what we can sustain,” the lobby said. They said they will soldier on with their acts of resistance no matter what the efforts to silence them will be. The six groups are Kenya Human Rights Commission, Kenya Tuitakayo Movement, Defenders Coalition, Inuka Trust Kenya Social Justice Working Group, and Article 19 Eastern Africa. Kiama got relief from the ruling after a court declined to detain him for 14 days as requested by the prosecution. In her ruling, the magistrate declined to grant the prosecution's application, saying there were no compelling reasons tabled before the court to warrant such detention. The court barred Kiama from mentioning the IMF and ordered him to deposit in court Sh500,000 and to be reporting to the investigating officer daily for 10 days. The magistrate directed the case to be mentioned on April 17 for further orders. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
