The National Assembly is set to begin the vetting and approval for appointment the nomination of Martha Koome as the country’s next Chief Justice. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday communicated to the House, Justice Koome’s nomination for CJ and President of the Supreme Court. He presented the certificate of presidential nomination, the judge’s CV, testimonials and recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission on the recruitment and selection process for the Chief Justice. The law provides that the President shall appoint the Chief Justice and deputy chief justice in accordance with the JSC recommendations and subject to the approval of the National Assembly. “The president therefore seeks the approval of the National Assembly on the said nomination,” Speaker Justin Muturi informed members on Wednesday. He directed the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chaired by Kangema MP Muturi Kigano to conduct the vetting and report the findings to the House within 28 days. Muturi asked the committee to notify the nominee and the general public – immediately - of the date and place of the approval hearings. “The committee should thereafter commence the necessary approval hearings and submit a report on or before May 25 for debate and decision by the House.” Muturi said that although the committee has 28 days to provide a report, the team was requested to consider the nomination on a priority basis. “The committee is requested to consider the nomination on a priority basis,” he said. Koome beat nine other applicants to the Chief Justice post and was unveiled by the JSC on Tuesday as the first woman CJ after vigorous interviews. Judges, prominent lawyers in private practice and law scholars sought to take over from Justice David Maraga who retired in December last year.
