 Kisumu mortuaries flouting strict Covid-19 regulations on the duration for the preservation and time to release bodies will lose licences. The administration has instructed mortuaries to keep bodies for no more than 72 hours. Relatives collecting their loved one's remains should do so by 10am. Governor Anyang Nyong'o has directed the department of health to withdraw licences of mortuaries that break the guidelines. Nyong'o said the Covid-19 response committee was concerned that the conduct of some morgues was putting residents at risk. The governor further directed that no morgue be allowed to admit bodies from other facilities. Bodies should not be kept beyond the stipulated 72 hours. The directive comes as the Covid-19 positivity rate has risen sharply in the county. Nyong'o said the positivity rate was 15.7 per cent on April 16 compared to 9.5 per cent the preceding week. The cumulative positivity rate in the county is 9.3 per cent. The total number of Covid-19 deaths in Kisumu is 87. Six people died from the virus in the last week. “There shall be no night vigil in the homes of the deceased as well as catering services. The maximum attendees to the burial ceremony still stand at 100 persons only,” Nyong'o said last month. The governor also directed restaurants and bars to obey Covid-19 protocols and close by 9pm.
