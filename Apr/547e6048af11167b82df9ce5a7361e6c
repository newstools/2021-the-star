Just why did the loud noises of an abrasive lawmaker from Western go silent when his mates were debating the lockdown (pictured) imposed by President Uhuru Kenyatta last Friday? Well, the man had earlier warned it wouldn’t be business as usual at the chambers where he promised to lead a protest march against the move and other Covid-19 containment measures that had ignited his anger. The good politician, who rarely hides his reaction or pulls his punches, never uttered a word in the House despite the acres of time accorded to members during the closure session. Maybe colleagues who dismissed his tantrums were right about a paper tiger. Speaking of anger, there is more than meets the eye about a state department notorious for snubbing summonses by parliamentary committees. A sitting can barely end without MPs lamenting the state entity being a closed book for many who seek its crucial services. So bad is the situation that some matters that were raised as far back as two years ago are yet to be dealt with. With the pile of business members transact in a sitting, some observers are already noting keenly how time spent on the follow-ups, which are more administrative, is summing up to mere days. Talking of time, a nominated member appears to be so good gabbing that he even loses track of the clock. Well, the outspoken legislator – who rarely misses a chance to get in a word on the floor — recently dumbfounded a senior parliamentary official with his explanation of why he was at the precincts early. The man, from a county with global acclaim, appeared lost in his explanation that he was there early to beat the other members on arrival time. Oddly, it wasn’t a scheduled sitting day. Maybe it had to do with the numerous calendar changes they are getting accustomed to. (Edited by V. Graham)
