Justice Marete Njagi has explained why he is fit to be Chief Justice of Kenya. Speaking before JSC on Thursday, Marete said his track record speaks for himself. He says the commission should go to Chuka at his farm and see how he takes care of his two cows or his coffee farm. “I am capable of this job, even my coffee shamba will tell you I'm capable,” he said. Though he has not served in a big office, judge Marete said, his past work at Sheria house speaks for itself and given the chance to be CJ he is equal to the task. Asked why his private practice only lasted 11 months before he sought employment, the judge said private practice is not his cup of tea because he is a public servant. “I realized I was not a politician so I came back to pursue my profession. I have always known I am not a practitioner. There are so many things I can do with law but not as a practitioner. I have my limitations. Private legal practice is not my thing,” said the judge. He gave examples of first-time ministers in the Jomo Kenyatta regime saying despite being young and having no past experience they did their work. “In the first parliament most of the cabinet ministers were in their 30s but we walked through. Jomo Kenyatta was a freedom fighter and not a president before but we walked through. To gauge what I am capable of doing look at my work at Sheria house. We have not been to these big offices because no one has given us the opportunity,” he said. When given the chance to be CJ, he said he will learn quickly and will be able to lead the judiciary. “I don’t see any link between being a CJ and legal practitioner. This is a public office any leader can lead particularly if you are fast.” Judge Marete says he is the man of the moment and Kenyans have spoken. "The voice of Kenyans is all over the air . It's Marete they want. This is the man, the voice of Kenya" the judge said.
