Lugari MP Ayub Savula wants three leaders from Western to show what they have achieved since they were named Luhya community spokespersons. He said Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, his Bungoma counterpart Wycliffe Wangamati and Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa have failed to use their closeness to the President to assist the Luhya community. The three were named Luhya spokespersons during a meeting at the residence of Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli in Kajiado county on May 31 last year. Savula said the three had promised to push for development in the region, but the promises remained just lip service. Speaking at Forrestal Secondary School in his Lugari constituency on Sunday, Savula said the three should state publicly what their team has achieved. The lawmaker said Oparanya did not use his position as the Council of Governors chairman to advance issues affecting the Luhya community, especially the revival of Mumias Sugar Company, the economic mainstay of the region. "We expected that the three will engage the President to have Mumias Sugar Company revived and the receiver-manager removed from the factory. Nzoia Sugar is still ailing, Pan Paper is down, tea and maize farmers still face challenges and they have gone silent," Savula said.
