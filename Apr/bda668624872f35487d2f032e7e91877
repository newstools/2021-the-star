Despite their struggles in the Kenya Women Premier League, Kibera soccer coach Ramadhan Vijago believes his four players who are in the national team training camp have what it takes to perform at the highest level. Goalkeeper Pauline Muthyake and midfielders Lavendine Lihemo, Lilian Mmboga, and Karinda Nyabuto are in the Harambee Starlets training camp in preparations for the Women's African Cup of Nations qualifiers slated for June. He said the cancellation of Starlets' friendly against the Copper Queens of Zambia denied football lovers the chance to see live the quality of the four players. Prior to the league being stopped as a containment measure for the pandemic, Kibera were placed sixth in the eight-team standings in Zone 'A'. The team registered two wins, three draws, and five losses in 10 matches-managing nine points. "Training with the Starlets is a boost for the quartet and I want to appreciate them for their hard work and dedication they have shown. Lihemo and Nyabuto missed the first leg because of injuries. They only played in two matches before the league was stopped and have managed their first call-ups. This goes to show their capability and quality," Vijago said. "Our dismal performance in the league was not a factor in their call up. But it is a morale booster to the whole team that everything is possible with commitment." Lihemo was instrumental in Kibera's second win of the season after scoring a double against Makolanders in the team's bid to avoid relegation. Vijago said Lihemo is set for a bright future as long as she can shed off high school game and embrace modern football. Lihemo sat for her Form 4 exams in 2019.
