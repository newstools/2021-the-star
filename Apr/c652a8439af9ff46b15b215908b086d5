Makadara MP George Aladwa has dismissed as hearsay, reports that ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna has been kicked out of the position. He said that Sifuna, as the spokesperson of the party, can only be removed by the party delegates. "Nobody can just wake up and kick out secretary general of the party. It is not as easy as people think," he said. Aladwa spoke on Tuesday at his Jogoo Road office after disbursing bursary cheques. Aladwa also talked about the Handshake and the BBI, insisting that the truce between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM boss Raila Odinga was intact. As a party, he said, they are focused on the forthcoming referendum with their eyes set on the presidency in 2020. Aladwa disclosed that as a party delegate, he will support Raila's candidature to fly the party flag for President even as he called on governors Hassan Joho and Wycliffe Oparanya, who have expressed interest in the ticket, to shelve their ambitions. Following a press statement attacking Nasa principals, there were reports Sifuna could be let go. In the release, Sifuna told off Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula. He said, “We now have to contend with a band of pretenders to the throne, who think that the presidency is a potato you can slice in pieces and share out at a table”. In December 2020, Sifuna was forced to apologise over insulting remarks he made against Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa during the Msambweni by-election campaigns. The comments were deemed to promote sexual violence. He offered to undertake 50 hours of pro bono legal services to victims of gender-based violence in 2021.
