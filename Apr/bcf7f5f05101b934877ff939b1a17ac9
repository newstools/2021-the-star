Basketball stakeholders have called for the resumption of Kenya Basketball Federation leagues after a successful Covid-19 vaccination process. The general consensus among players, coaches and referees is that playing should resume but with strict Covid-19 observations — preferably outdoors. Equity Bank tactician David Maina observed: “It’s important to take the vaccine and now that we have, I expect us to resume playing while observing health protocols.” Juma Kent, the University of Nairobi ‘Dynamites’ coach, who was busy organising the activities of the day said: “League action need to resume. We only need two weeks to train.” Tony Ochieng of Strathmore University hailed KBF for the initiative. “This is the best thing to have happened for the players. I fully support it. We should now play outdoors because of ventilation,” he said. Shem Otieno, who moved from Thunder to Equity Bank and had played only one league game before the suspensions noted: “KBF should not only plan for fewer matches in a day but also increase the number of referees involved.” Umoja’s guard Renny  Moibi said: “This is our lifestyle. We are used to playing basketball week-in week-out. There is very little for us at the moment. We would like to resume action.” Equity Bank and national team guard Samba Mjomba said: “I miss playing but it’s important to be healthy first. However, we can now play as long as we observe the Covid-19 protocols. This thing (coronavirus) is real and we don’t want to lose anyone.” Her teammate, Linda Alando, said: “Sport is a livelihood for many youngsters and it’s important that they are engaged.” Referee Dynah Myaka concluded: “It will be great for us to be busy while observing Covid-19 protocols because we don’t know when the pandemic will end.”
