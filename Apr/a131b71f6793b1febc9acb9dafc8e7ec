Kenya wheelchair tennis team have intensified their preparations for the World Team Cup qualifiers slated for Portugal next month. The team has been holed up at the Windsor Golf and Country Club for the past fortnight, adapting to the hardcourt surface which they will use at the Portuguese event. Two slots will be up for grabs in the week-long qualifiers which will bring regional teams from Asia, Europe and Oceania and coach Peter Rakauom is bullish about their chances despite the Nairobi Open, which was due to be played later this, week being cancelled. “It's unfortunate that the tournament we had planned to use as a build-up for the international event has been canceled. We have to look at alternatives in order to keep the players fit and competitive,” said Rakuom. The women's team, which has the likes of the experienced Jane Ndenga, Phoebe Masika and Paralympian Asiya Sururu will fancy their chances, having graced the World Cup on two occasions. The men's team, composed of Peter Munuve, Collins Lumumba, Rajab Abdalla and Shaban Warioba, will be targetting a first-ever appearance at the World Cup slated for Sardinia, Italy in October. Rakuom said the two teams have adjusted accordingly to the hardcourt surface with one more week of training before departure on May 2. The qualifiers are set for May 5-13 in Vilamoura, Portugal. Rakuom expects stiff competition to come from the European nations. "European nations will be some of the formidable teams to look out for based on player pedigree and experience and we must match them if we are to stand a chance of qualifying,” he added. Great Britain, France, Japan, Argentina, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, USA, Korea Republic and Brazil have already qualified for the World Team Cup World Group event. Four qualifiers and two wild cards will complete the 16-team field. In the women's category, the qualified teams are—Netherlands, Japan, Great Britain, South Africa, China and USA.
