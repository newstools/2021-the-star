Slain Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) video editor Betty Barasa's funeral was held on Wednesday at her Oloolua, Ngong home. Barasa was shot dead at her home on April 7. Police said the gunmen behind the murder of Betty Barasa were on an assassination mission, police have said. The well-known journalist died of a single wound to the face by an AK-47 or other combat rifle on Tuesday night last week in Oloolua, Ngong. The killers wore heavy industrial gloves and balaclavas, her husband Geoffrey Barasa said. The men who killed Betty were in constant communication with unknown people over the phone. After Betty was killed, one man said on the phone the mission had been accomplished, "tumemaliza." “The gang seemed to have been experts out to eliminate the lady. The other things they stole were to cover up the incident,” a detective familiar with the probe said on Sunday. The postmortem report said she died of a single bullet to the head.
