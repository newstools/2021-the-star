Two people arrested with 180kg of zebra and did-dik meat were on Friday charged with possession of illegal game meat. David Musyimi, 57, and Mwendo Mumba, 26, appeared before Kajiado resident magistrate Becky Cheloti and denied the charges. The prosecution said the two were arrested with the meat on Thursday in the Nkama area of Mashuuru subcounty. They were released on a bond of Sh300,000 each with a surety of a similar amount. Hearing of the case will start on June 14.
