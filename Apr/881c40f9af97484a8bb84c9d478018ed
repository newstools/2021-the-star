A city engineer was on Monday charged in a Kibera court with conspiring to grab a parcel of land worth Sh200 million in South C, Nairobi. Nicholas Onyango was charged before senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto. He denied the charges. Onyango jointly with another before the court allegedly attempted to defraud the late James Meme Anampiu of his plot registration number LR209/10691 by issuing its title to Family Bank River Road branch, Nairobi, to be used as security to obtain a loan of Sh40,000 without the consent of the administrator of the state, Edith Muthoni Meme. According to the police report, Muthoni received a phone call from her caretaker who informed her there was someone at Family Bank who alleged to have been sent by late James Meme. She then rushed to the land and met the accused persons who introduced themselves as valuers sent by Family Bank. They presented a letter given by the bank to value the parcel for an intended loan. The police report says the complainant informed the valuers that her father died and there was no way he would sign documents. She told them they had not applied for a loan using the land as collateral. The complainant alerted the police leading to the arrest of Onyango. Prosecutor Allan Mogere objected to his release on bond. Mogere told the court that the accused person was a flight risk and had failed to turn up in court on previous occasions. Onyango denied being a flight risk as he was a Covid-19 victim. He said he needed to be freed on bond as he had a chest problem that needed medication. Kuto directed that he be locked up at Lang’ata police station pending bond ruling. He also directed that the accused person be assisted to get some medications.  Edited by Henry Makori
