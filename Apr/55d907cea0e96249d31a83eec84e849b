President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday assented to the Division of Revenue Bill, 2021. This paves way for the enactment of the County Allocation of Revenue Bill, 2021 and the Appropriation Act, 2021/22. Present at State House, Nairobi during the signing ceremony were Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi, his Senate counterpart Ken Lusaka, Head of Public Service Dr Joseph Kinyua and Treasury CS Ukur Yatani. Others were Attorney General Kihara Kariuki, House Majority Leaders Samuel Poghisio (Senate) and Amos Kimunya (National Assembly), Clerks of the two houses Michael Sialai (National Assembly) and Jeremiah Nyegenye (Senate) as well as State House Deputy Chief of Staff Njee Muturi. Counties have had a long wait for the National Treasury to develop a legal framework for disbursing Sh39.9 billion conditional grants. Parliament on Wednesday voted to remove the grants from the Division of Revenue Bill, 2021, thereby reducing the revenue share for the devolved units to Sh370 billion. The National Assembly made the move in concurrence with the Senate that the grants cannot be included in the bill setting revenue share between the two levels of government.
