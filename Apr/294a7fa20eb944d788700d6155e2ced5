Rayvannyâ€™s baby mama Fahyma says the singer has neglected his own child in the wake of his new relationship and the ongoing drama with Harmonize. She said Rayvanny should just forget about them (Fahyma and son) and concentrate on his new relationship, instead of frustrating her for no good reason. "Kwa kukurahisishia sina mahusiano na wewe tena maana umenidanganya vya kutoshaa, endelea na hiyo familia yako mpya mimi na mtoto wangu tuwache, hatukuhusu kaa mbali na hao malaya zako," she said. "Usinifanye mtu mjinga kwa ajili ya manufaa yako. Mimi nimekaa kimya kwa muda mrefu lakini inatosha siwezi tena kufanywa mjinga." The two have been in an on-and-off relationship. They are blessed with a handsome baby boy called Jaydan. The mother of one cursed the artiste and his new relationship.
