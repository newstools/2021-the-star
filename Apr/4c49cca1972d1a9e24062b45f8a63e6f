A case against the ban on importation, distribution and administration of Covid-19 vaccines by the private sector will be heard on May 5. Justice Anthony Mrima certified the case by the Law Society of Kenya as urgent and directed it to serve the Attorney General, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe and his Interior counterpart Fred Matiang’i with the application and petition within two days. The LSK sued the state and listed the three as respondents. They will be required to respond within 10 days upon being served. In the case, the LSK, through its president Nelson Havi, wants the court to declare the ban unconstitutional and stop its enforcement. Havi says the ban and cancellation of licences issued to vaccine importers and distributors should not have been made at a time when the government has set its vaccination goal by January 2022 at 30 per cent of the population. “The ban, which was imposed after a section of Kenyans, led by Deputy President William Ruto, started going for Russia's Sputnik vaccine, violates Article 43 of the Constitution that guarantees the right to the highest attainable standard of health,” he says. The LSK is also challenging the raft of Covid-19 mitigation measures imposed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, including a lockdown in a five-county zone around the capital and the night-to-dawn curfew. According to court documents, the President's Public Order dated March 26 is not founded on any legal provision.
