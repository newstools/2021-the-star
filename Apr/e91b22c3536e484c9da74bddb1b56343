Three Turkana residents have been killed by suspected Nyangatom from Ethiopia at Kibish. Confirming the incident on Tuesday Rift Valley Regional Coordinator George Natembeya said a group of Nyangatom believed to be from Ethiopia attacked Turkana herders along the border of Kenya- Ethiopia on Monday night. He said the armed group killed three people and stole more than 163 head of cattle and 50 sheep and goats. “The herders living along the border had been tipped off about  the possible attack, they were told to move but others delayed to move and that’s how they were caught up in the incident. Among the three killed include an 18 year old,” he said. He said the security agents have been dispatched to the border. “We are trying to check what happened during the incident. We have a contingent security team including the Rapid Deployment Unit and General Service Unit along the border to protect the local herders,” he said. Natembeya has urged residents not to graze along the border because it attracts raiders and it only takes them less than 30minutes to cross to another country with livestock. "We have dispatched a security team to protect the local herders from external aggression, and we will also recruit more National Police Reservists to protect locals along the border." Natembeya said.
