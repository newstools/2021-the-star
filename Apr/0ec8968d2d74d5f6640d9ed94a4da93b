The High Court sitting in Nairobi has said President Uhuru Kenyatta's creation of the position of Chief Administrative Secretaries in all government ministries was unconstitutional. High Court Judge Anthony Mrima also said Cabinet Secretaries (CSs) who were appointed in the first term must be approved by the National Assembly to serve in the second term. PSs who were also not shortlisted, interviewed and appointed in line with the law were found to be holding positions contrary to the constitution. However Justice Mrima suspended his decision for 30 days to allow the Attorney General to file an affidavit on ethnic and gender composition of the Cabinet. He said for all appointive positions, the two-thirds gender rule must be realised immediately.
