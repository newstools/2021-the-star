Harambee Starlets goalkeeper Annette Kundu is keen to join a Kenya Women Premier League club while on holiday to boost her fitness levels before returning to Cyprus in August. Kundu, who is in the country on a four-month holiday, helped Ael Champions finish fourth in the 10-team league in Cyprus Women's Division One League last month. Kundu, formerly of Eldoret Falcons alongside Ruth Ingosi, were among players called up to Harambee Starlets for a friendly match against the Copper Queens of Zambia, which was cancelled due to coronavirus. Eager to maintain her fine form, Kundu said:  "In as much as I am on holiday, I cannot afford to lose my head by staying idle. The best thing for me is in case the league resumes, I will look for a club that can accommodate my services." "I want to be super-fit before I return," added Kundu, who comes from a sporting family where elder sister Agrippina Kundu is a volleyball player with both Kenya Pipeline and Malkia Strikers. Kundu last played for Kenya in December 2019, guiding the Starlets to winning the CECAFA women's championship in Tanzania. She conceded no goal in the tournament, bagging the golden glove award. The shot stopper's unmatched display in goal captured the attention of Tanzania's Simba FC but Kundu opted to head overseas.
