Kenya Prisons coach David Lung'aho has rued the absence of Egyptian teams at the 2021 African Club Championship set for April 16-18 in Sousse, Tunisia. Lung'aho observed that the absence of perennial winners, the 2019 champions Al Ahly, as well as runners up Smouha, will water down the level of competition. Al Ahly are 14-time winners Smouha clinched bronze medalists in 2018 and 2016 in addition to finishing fourth in 2015. The clubs have also produced some of the top players on the continent with Al Ahly left attacker Ahmed Salah inducted into the "Hall of Fame" in 2019. Salah has won 11 club titles in 12 finals he has played in, the most in the history of the competition since its inception in 1980. Smouha had Mohamed El Mahdy (best server), Mohamed Reda (best receiver) and Amir Kerboua (best setter) at the 2019 awards. "There's no hiding from the fact that the competitive nature of the game will not be at 100 per cent following the withdrawal of experienced teams like Al Ahly and Smouha," Lung'aho Observed. "However, I still believe Tunisian teams are equally good alongside the rest of the participants. Our desire is that competition will remain cut-throat and that every team gets a chance to take their game to the next level." Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) will be making their maiden appearance in the tournament whileÂ  General Service Unit GSU will hope to replicate their 2018 title-winning heroics.
