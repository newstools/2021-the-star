Manchester United defender Eric Bailly has signed a new deal to commit him to the club until 2024. The 27-year-old Ivory Coast international has played exactly 100 times for United since a £30m move from Villarreal in 2016. He has suffered frequent injury problems during his time in England. “I’m very happy. This decision is something I didn’t have to think about — I love this club and I love playing for Manchester United,” he said. “Now the moment with my injury has passed and I’m fit and feel good, and that’s it. A new contract is like a new challenge and I’m ready for this.” Bailly’s new contract contains the option for an extra year.
