Samuel Wanyonyi who emerged as the third best candidate in the 2020 KCPE exam with 431 marks says he wants to become a pilot. Wanyonyi who was a pupil at Nzoia Sugar Primary School in Bungoma was the best performer in Western region. He said he was happy with the results, adding, "I thank God for my performance." He wants to join Mang'u High School for secondary education. His mother, Irene Makheti, said she has been raising her son single-handedly after his father perished in a road accident. "I brought him here in Standard 4. The school management has been very supportive," Makheti said. She said Wanyonyi is disciplined and polite and he takes his schoolwork seriously. The mother thanked the school's headteacher Lydia Namisi who took over the guardianship, providing personal effects and also paying fees. Namisi joined Nzoia Sugar Primary when Wanyonyi was in Standard 6. Governor Wycliffe Wangamati visited and congratulated two other top boys in the county, Samuel Makhanu of Nzoia Sugar Primary School and Kibet Ndiema of Nalondo CBM Primary School, for their sterling performance in the exam. Wangamati promised to ensure bright and needy students in the county continue with their education even as they transit to secondary school.
