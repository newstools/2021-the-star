The Council of Governors has decried the lack of testing kits in counties as Kenya strives to contain the spread of Covid-19. “Testing across all counties has slowed down due to lack of kits. This, therefore, means that County Governments have no control over the increasing number of Infections,” Health Committee chairman Anyang Nyong’o has said. In a statement on Wednesday, Nyong’o asked the ministry to avail rapid testing kits (antigens) and PCR Covid-19 testing equipment to all counties to stem the spread of the virus. Nyongo said there are a total of 7,751 beds in 142 isolation centres out of which 6,890 beds are available for patients in 38 counties. He said these counties also have a total of 375 beds in the ICU out of which 321 beds are available for new patients, and a total of 167 beds in the HDU out of which 107 beds are available. Nyongo said 874,932 doses have been received out of which 642,751 doses have been administered as follows: Healthcare workers – 136,084,  Security – 52,603, Teachers– 97,786 and Others – 356,278. “We note with concern that there is low uptake of the vaccine by the target population. As a county we shall enhance advocacy measures to increase public confidence on the effectiveness of the vaccine,” he said. The chairman said by April 15, the National Treasury had disbursed Sh10.6 Billion to county governments. The current outstanding amount owed to county governments is Sh83 billion. Out of this, Sh3.9 Billion is owed to Nairobi City County for the months of December and January. CoG says Sh26 billion is owed to the 47 Counties for the month of February, Sh25 billion for the month of March and Sh28 billion for the month of April. “The Council of Governors will work with the County Assemblies to engage the National Treasury for the immediate release of these funds,” he said.
