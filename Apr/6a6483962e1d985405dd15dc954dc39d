KTDA has demanded the unconditional release of four of its Junior ICT staff who have been held hostage by police officers at KTDA headquarters in Nairobi. The Kenya Tea Development Agency Limited Headquarters was on Friday raided by individuals who presented themselves as police officers. The raid led to arrest of staffers who were later released but four detained. The reason for the raid still remains unclear. In a statement on Saturday, KTDA said the four should be released immediately. "The four staff members remain incommunicado, with family members and the company gravely concerned over their well-being," the organisation said. All other staff were released by 8:00 pm and informed to leave their offices drawers and lockers open. The building remains in the hands of the police who have denied authorized KTDA staff access to the offices. The Agency said the Magistrateâ€™s Court order that was produced to facilitate the raid neither made mention of detention of staff, nor did it include the restriction of entry into and exit out of the building by KTDA employees. "These unlawful actions continue to be undertaken by law enforcement offices notwithstanding the existence of a High Court of Kenya Order restraining such an action," they noted .
