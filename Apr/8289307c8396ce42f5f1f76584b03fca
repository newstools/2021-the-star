Kesses MP Swarup Mishra has filed an application in court seeking leave to commence contempt proceedings against blogger Robert Alai. On April 7, Justice Mbogholi Msagha restrained Alai from further publishing defamatory remarks against Mediheal Hospital and Fertility Center Limited on his social media posts. But the MP says even after the order was issued, Alai went on a Twitter spree of tarnishing the name of Justice Mbogholi who was falsely accused of receiving a bribe from the hospital to issue the orders. He also mentioned justices Jaqueline Kamau and Said Chitembwe. In an affidavit, Mishra says the Twitter posts by Alai purport to castigate or intimidate the said judges and to have them pre-judged by the public. “The castigation of the judges and the accusations of corruption without any evidence is calculated to interfere and pervert the due administration of justice in the main case,” the legislator says. Mishra is the director of Mediheal Hospital and Fertility Centre Limited. Mediheal is a medical services provider running a group of hospitals known as Mediheal hospitals, which are located at Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru and Kigali, Rwanda. The MP says Alai’s allegations are serious and imply that Justice Mbogholi who issued the order was bribed. Mbogholi granted the order after the hospital argued that Alai had lately gone on a spree of spreading false information about it, alleging that they are being used to conduct illegal trafficking of human organs. On April 7, the judge certified the case as urgent and directed that Alai be served with the papers ahead of the hearing on April 22.  Alai is yet to respond. Court documents indicate that the allegations by Alai are severely denting the image of the hospital locally and internationally. This has led to panic among current and potential patients, investors, partners, financiers and donors resulting in loss of business and opportunities, which is hurting the hospital.
