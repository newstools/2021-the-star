Kenya Rugby will partner with the Damu Pevu Society and World Rugby to introduce the sport in primary schools from next month. Kenya Rugby Union chairman Oduor Gangla said they have identified three training centres in Kisumu (to cater for Western Kenya), Embu (Mount Kenya) and Nakuru (Rift valley). The goal will be to ensure that primary school teachers are trained on the basics of the game and introduce the game at the school level where Kenya Rugby and Damu Pevu will monitor the progress every month. World Rugby will provide trainers to the teachers. Gangla added that Kenyan rugby players start learning the game at an advanced age when compared to their peers from powerhouse rugby nations, who start at a young age. “Our players are disadvantaged. They start playing the game at between 13 and 16 years while the big rugby nations start from as early as five. We feel this introduction will go along way in addressing some of those challenges,” said Gangla. The programme will start with 32 teachers from 16 counties. The chairman said they are keen on getting transformation of the game and termed the initiative, which starts this weekend, as a game-changer for Kenyan rugby. Elsewhere, Kabras RFC assistant coach Edwin Achayo has admitted the suspension of sports in the country has disoriented the Kenya Cup League leaders. The Kakamega-based club had started the season in imperious form, winning four matches out of four, before President Uhuru Kenyatta suspended sports action in the country due to a spike in Covid-19 cases in the country. "We can't stand still as much as the season has stopped. We are still interacting with our players through various platforms to guide them and keep them sharp to ensure that we are not caught off-guard when the season resumes,” said Achayo.
