President Uhuru Kenyatta has declared four vacancies in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. Uhuru announced this in a gazette notice dated April 14. For almost two years, the IEBC has been operating with only three commissioners out of the maximum seven. It also has had no substantive CEO. The chairman is Wafula Chebukati, who sits with commissioners Boya Molu and Abdi Guliye. The three were left were the only commissioners left after the resignation of colleagues Roselyn Akombe, Paul Kurgat, Margaret Mwachanya and Connie Maina. Akombe resigned days before the repeat of the presidential election on October 26, 2017. Vice-chairperson Maina, Mwachanya and Kurgat quit in April 2018. The Building Bridges Initiative report has recommended a total overhaul of the electoral agency with the secretarial staff undergoing fresh vetting ahead of the 2022 general elections. The BBI task force said that political parties should have a say on who becomes commissioners, a recommendation that was rejected by Deputy President William Ruto and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. Last year, the President signed into law the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2019, paving the way for filling the five vacant positions at the electoral body. The President will receive four nominees from the Parliamentary Service Commission, one from the Law Society of Kenya and two from the Inter-Religious Council of Kenya.
