Kenyan International goalkeeper, Ian Otieno has urged Zesco United players to quickly shift focus to the Zambian Super League after falling to Lusaka Dynamos in the Absa Cup final at the MTN Woodlands Stadium, Lusaka on Saturday. Zesco United failed in their spirited attempt to defend their title and clinch it for the seventh time in the closely contested final, where they lost 3-1 on post-match penalties. Otieno told the official club website that he is convinced the club has the right arsenal to charge for the Zambian Super League title despite the huge setback. “We are disappointed that we lost the final. Our objective was to win both the league and the league cup. Unfortunately, the latter hasn’t materialized. “There is no need for us to feel demoralized because we still have the Super League to fight for,” he said. Otieno has now sent a passionate plea to his teammates to put aside their disappointment and concentrate on the more precious prize in contention. “The target now is to go for the league. Yes, the league cup is sweet but the Zambian super league is sweeter. “We need to quickly adjust from Saturday’s defeat and focus on Wednesday’s game against Red Arrows. Our aim is to win the league title and get back into the Caf Champions League.” The shot-stopper came in handy in the Absa finals after saving two penalties but his efforts went down the drain following the unexpected debacle. Other than Otieno, veteran Kenyan striker Jesse Were also featured for Zesco. Zesco United have a date with Red Arrows in the FAZ/MTN Super League week 26 fixture scheduled for the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium in Ndola on Wednesday.
