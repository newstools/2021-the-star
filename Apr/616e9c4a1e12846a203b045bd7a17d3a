A man accused of violating a traffic offence has refused to mitigate at a Kibera law court on Friday evening and urged the magistrate not to have mercy on him. “I don’t want any mercy. I have committed an offence, just give me a harsh penalty,” Fredrick Okumu told Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki moments after pleading guilty to driving a defective motor vehicle contrary to the traffic act. “Why do you say that we don’t have mercy on you? You want the vehicle owner to pay the fine isn’t it so? Mwaniki asked him. In response, he told him that he was the one who committed the offence. “I am the one who committed the offence, just punish me,” he said. He is accused of driving  KAU 125 make Toyota along James Gichuru road in Dagoretti Sub-county within Nairobi county. Mwaniki ordered him to pay Sh10,000 fine or spend three months in jail. Before his sentencing, Okumu had spent most of his time preaching to some of the suspects who were present in court telling them on the importance of being the children of God.
