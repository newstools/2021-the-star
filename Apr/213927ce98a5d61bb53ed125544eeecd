A Nakuru-based cleric has narrated how he suffered stigma after he contracted Covid-19. Anglican Church of Kenya Nakuru Diocese Bishop Joseph Muchai said being sidelined at a time when one needs care and encouragement is worse than the disease itself. The cleric, who was in the Intensive Care Unit for a week, said stigma has left many families traumatised. “From my experience, I can tell you that stigma associated to Covid-19 can lead to depression among survivors and their family members,” he said. Muchai said being in isolation can be very lonely and patients require love, care and encouragement. “Comforting messages and a show of care and love can make the ordeal a little lighter,” the bishop, who led fellow clerics during a virtual church service at Good Shepherd Cathedral, said. Nakuru is among five counties classified as 'disease-infected' that were placed under strict containment measures by President Uhuru Kenyatta due to high cases of Covid-19 infections. Other counties are Nairobi, Kiambu, Machakos and Kajiado. Muchai said it is unfortunate that slightly more than a year after the first Covid-19 case was reported in the country, stigma among patients had doubled. “We should focus on giving people hope rather than discouraging them. I was subjected to stigma and I would not like any other person to undergo a similar treatment,” he said. He added that it will be difficult to fight the disease if stigma is not eliminated. “We must accept that anybody can fall victim to this disease as it does not discriminate.” Muchai asked the government and the Association of Insurers of Kenya (AKI) to come up with modalities on how the insurance companies can cover Covid-19 patients because the pandemic might be here longer than expected.
