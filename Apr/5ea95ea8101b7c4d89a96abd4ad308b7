Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has urged the county government staff to invest in their rural homes. He urged them to build good houses, plant trees and invest in agriculture. "Have a permanent house and plant trees instead of waiting for a temporary structure to be put up when you pass on," Ojaamong said. He spoke on Friday during the burial of county disability mainstreaming officer Stephen Buluma, 56, in Bukani village in Samia subcounty. The governor eulogised Buluma as a brave man, saying they met during campaigns in 2012 and ealier on at St Paul's Amukura High School in the 1990s. "I will sit with speaker Bernard Wamalwa to see how best to assist Buluma's children to complete their education. My government will assist Buluma's children with bursary to ensure they complete their education," he said. Buluma joined the county government of Busia on April 1, 2014 as the pioneer ward administrator for Namboboto/Nambuku ward in Samia subcounty. In 2019, he was transferred to the county headquarters. On the night of April 9, 2021, he developed sudden breathing difficulties and was rushed to the Busia County Referral Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
