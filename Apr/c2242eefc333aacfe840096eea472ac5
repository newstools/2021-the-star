A multi-agency team of security officers on Thursday arrested two suspected poachers in the Nkama area of Kajiado with game meat. The arresting team was led by Kajiado Kenya Wildlife Service investigation officers, who acted on a tipoff from members of the public. County KWS senior warden Julius Cheruiyot said the two were found in possession of zebra and dik-dik meat weighing about 180kg and half a kilogramme respectively. “The third suspect, who was riding a motorbike, escaped the arrest. One of the suspects is a notorious poacher who has been involved in poaching for more than 10 years,” Cheruiyot said. The KWS official said the second suspect, a 26-year-old man, had been arrested last year and arraigned, during which he pleaded guilty to the charge. The suspect was sentenced to a five-year jail term without an option of a fine. It is not clear how he left prison. Other recoveries confiscated from the two suspects by the multi-agency team on Thursday included two knives. The suspects, according to Cheruiyot, are to be arraigned on Friday. Before the coronavirus struck, most game meat from Mashuuru, Isinya and other parts of Kajiado Central would find its way to the Burma Market in Nairobi. Game meat is transported to different places on motorbikes to avoid police roadblocks.
