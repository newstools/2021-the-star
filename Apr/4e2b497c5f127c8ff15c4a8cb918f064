The Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kisumu on Wednesday reinstated Felix Olwero as the Siaya county assembly clerk. Justice Francis Radido quashed a decision of March 1, 2019, by the assembly to suspend and remove Olwero from the office. The suspended clerk challenged the suspension on account of irregular access to a car loan. The assembly accused Olwero of irregularly acquiring a Sh2 million car loan in 2015. On Wednesday, the judge set aside the proceedings of the assembly service board on the said allegations. According to the judgment, Olwero was reinstated as the bona fide and legal clerk of the assembly. The assembly service board had assigned Erick Ogenga to perform the duties of the clerk in an acting capacity. In the petition, Olwero was represented by  Rogo, Okelo, Wangari and Company Advocates, while the assembly was represented by Ogola and Kemboi Company Advocates. Lawyer Ogola requested for stay orders which the judge declined. Olwero thanked his legal team for a job well done and the almighty God for granting him justice. He appealed to the service board to respect the judgment and allow for smooth operations for the good of the assembly and the people of Siaya. "I pledge to be faithful to the board and do my work diligently in service the members of the assembly and the great people of Siaya as I have always done for the last five years as the clerk," he said. He said the staff should not be apprehensive because he will not be vengeful.
