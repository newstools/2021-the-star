A man suspected of murder at Bomakombi in Suneka was on Friday arrested while attempting to flee from the country. Nehemiah Asiago 41, is alleged to have killed his son by slitting his throat using a kitchen knife in June last year. He was arrested by detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations as he prepared to board a Qatar-bound flight. According to the DCI, Asiago killed his son Byron Asiago after a domestic squable and immediately went into hiding. "Byron’s brother told detectives that a disagreement arose after their father who was intoxicated, demanded to know what he had brought home from his day at the local centre,' the Directorate said in a statement via Twitter. "Incensed by his father’s remarks since he was jobless and had gone to look for a job that didn’t come by Byron posed a similar question to his father, asking him what he had to show for his day’s activities other than returning home in a drunken stupor." This allegedly prompted a scuffle, that led to the death of the young man. "Since then, Asiago went into hiding and has been operating between Nakuru and Nairobi until today afternoon, when our hawk-eyed sleuths pounced on him as he was preparing to fly out," the DCI said.
