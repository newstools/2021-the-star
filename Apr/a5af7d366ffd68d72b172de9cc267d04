Bidco United head coach Anthony Akhulia has condoled Stephen Waruru following the death of his son. “I know it's a painful experience and we are doing everything we can to support him. “Tentative plans are there to bury him on Friday in their ancestral home at Kabati,” said Akhulia. Meanwhile, Akhulia said he hopes that his players would adhere to the individual training programs provided by the technical bench to keep them fit. “We provided the guidelines as soon as the government announced the ban on sporting activities and we believe our players are following them keenly,” said Akhulia. The tactician, however, said there is no way such programs would fully replace the usual physical training the team is used to. “Obviously, you don't expect the individual training session to be as effective in preparing the players as the one-on-one physical exercises,” said Akhulia. “For example, I realised last time when we came back from the first Covid-19 break that our players were not good enough for competition and had to be sharpened further even after we had provided the individual training programs,” said Akhulia. The FKF-PL newbies kicked off the season on a low note but have since redeemed themselves with big wins over the much-fancied sides such as Tusker and Wazito. They are currently rooted in the ninth spot on the log with 21 points.
