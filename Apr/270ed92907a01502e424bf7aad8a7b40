The West Pokot county government is drilling 50 boreholes to reduce conflicts brought about by water scarcity in the region. The boreholes will also reduce disease outbreaks caused by overcrowding of animals in the few available water sources. Governor John Lonyangapuo  said the project will boost accessibility of water for pastoralists and farmers, especially during dry seasons. He spoke at Riwo after launching the drilling of Kalemnyang borehole. “From January to March we experience drought. The boreholes will cushion residents and livestock from thirst,” he said. Kalemnyang residents have been trekking for more than 15 kilometres in search of water while herders migrate to the neighbouring country of Uganda in search of pasture and water during dry seasons. The boreholes are along the main livestock migration route to Uganda. Lonyangapuo encouraged residents to engage in crop farming by using borehole water for irrigation. "The area is dry and residents have been facing hunger due to lack of water for farming,” he said. Resident Luke Kanyangareng said pastoralists in the area are happy because their animals will easily access water. Resident Joyce Chakamol said the borehole will help improve the social life of residents. “We laud the county government for the project. We have been walking long distances in search of water,” she said.
