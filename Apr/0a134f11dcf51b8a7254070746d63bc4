Kenyan representatives at the African Club Championship the General Service Unit and Kenya Ports Authority have their work cut out as they head into the quarter-finals on Friday. GSU entertain Esperance of Tunisia as the newbies KPA come up against tournament favourites Zamalek of Egypt.Â GSU finished second in Group 'D', behind Zamalek. GSU, the Kenya Volleyball Federation league champions, are hoping to repeat their 2018 feat when they won the championships. Despite losing their first match against Zamalek, GSU bounced back in style to beat Nigeria Customs and unfancied Espoir of Rwanda. Esperance topped Group 'A' and have been ruthless on their way to the quarters. They slew Burundi's Rukinzo 3-0 (25-13, 25-10, 25-9) in a one-sided encounter. Against KPA, Esperance were on their lethal best, humiliating the Kenyan side by the same scoreline. In the group decider against APR of Rwanda, the North Africans extended their ruthlessness in sets of 25-17, 25-20, 25-19, relegating the Kigali-based side to the classification matches. Debutants KPA on the other hand, face an uphill task against red-hot Zamalek. The KVF league runners up are no pushovers either and will have a point to prove against their seasoned opponents. With two wins and a loss to their name, the coastal side will heavily rely on the services of Sweden-based Enock Mogeni. The 24-year old, who can play as an outside or opposite-hitter is attached to Sodertelge and was voted the Most Valuable Player at the 2019 league playoffs. KPA, coached by Sammy Mulinge, who doubles up as the national women's beach volleyball coach, will have to adapt to the pressure of playing in a high-pressure environment.
