Former Inooro TV presenter Muthoni Mukiri says a breakup with her ex-boyfriend left her feeling hopeless and unwanted. Speaking on her YouTube channel, Muthoni said the breakup made her doubt her self-worth and to some extent, she even thought she was bewitched. "My breakup made me feel like a failure. I never thought I would recover from that. I was mad at everyone and would get constant headaches. "Sometimes we get into chaotic relationships and only realise so after breaking up. I thought I would never date again and that I was done with men." She advised those going through a breakup to avoid isolating themselves. "Do what you can at the moment. Do not sit alone when you are going through the worst. Pain will always be there but it’s the decisions you make that will help you decide the quality of life you will leave." Muthoni had in the past narrated how she dated a narcissist who would stalk her, tap her phone among many other cruel things. So bad was the relationship that she had to undergo therapy to get over it. She advised people to take a day at a time to practise self-care and just avoid things that hurt them in the first place, adding that it’s good to take lessons from the relationship as they will be beneficial in future. Muthoni is currently engaged to her fiance, Isaac Nganga. She is taking some time off the media to work on personal projects. "I feel I cannot do them when I’m in mainstream media because they require a lot of privacy."
