A South African accused of defrauding a city businessman of Sh10 million by pretending he would sell 40kg of gold to him was on Friday charged. Tshepang Godfrey Sidumo alias Amar is believed to have committed the offence on February 12, 2018 at Deeds Company Limited, Gitanga Road, Kilimani. He obtained $97,500 (Sh10,725,000) from Nashwan Kamal. He is said to have pretended that he was in a position to sell 40kg of gold to him, a fact he knew to be false. The prosecution told court that the accused should be denied bail as he has another file at city court and they need to review it before he is released. Sidumo allegedly jumped bail in the matter before city court and has been missing since 2018. He denied the charges before Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku who directed him detained pending review of the other file. Mutuku remanded Sidumo until Tuesday to allow the prosecution go through that file pending the determination of bond. The case will be mentioned on April 13.
