Muslims in Lamu have formed special committees that will ensure Covid-19 safety protocols are observed during the month-long Ramadhan. The special month of prayer and fasting commenced on Wednesday following the sighting of the crescent moon on Monday. This is the second year that Muslims around the globe will observe the holy month under Covid-19 restrictions. In this new plan, each mosque has been tasked with appointing its own committee that will ensure all faithful coming into the premises for prayers fully adhere to the regulations set by the Ministry of Health to curb the spread of the pandemic. According to Ustadh Hussein Noor, the committees will among other things control the number of people coming into the mosque to ensure there is no crowding. They will also guide faithful on the traditional Iftar gatherings in the evenings and ensure people remain safe. Iftar gatherings will only be limited to five people, Noor said. “Normally, people gather and enjoy group meals during Iftar but currently this is deadly and we wouldn’t want the faithful to risk. The committees have orders to only allow gatherings of not more than five people. The point is to ensure there is no congestion at any given point during Ramadhan," Noor said. Any other gathering during this period will only be limited to 50 people. Rodhwa mosque elder Muhammed Shee said floors of mosques have been marked to guide faithful on social distancing. He said handwashing points have been erected in all mosques in the region and urged faithful to ensure they wash hands and sanitise before entering and after leaving the mosques. Ustadh Sharif Twawy said despite the Covid-19 pandemic, this year’s Ramadhan was unique as faithful have been allowed to worship in mosques unlike last year when mosques were shut. Muslims have equally been urged to conduct the remaining part of the Taraweh (special night prayers) in their homes due to the curfew. Edited by Henry Makori
