National boxing team coach Musa Benjamin is deeply concerned about the suspension of sporting activities in the country. The Hit Squad tactician believes the indefinite suspension of sports by the government due to the Covid-19 third wave situation will only make sports personalities rustier in the run-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. The tactician now wants national teams to be accorded special dispensation to continue training in preparation for upcoming international events. He says the current situation will only jeopardize Kenya's prospects and invites to overseas events. The Hit Squad has been invited to participate in two events in Norway and the Philippines prior to Olympics in Tokyo. He was speaking in Nairobi during the LG Sports Personality of the Month of March Award, where Elly Ajowi was feted as the winner. "All the gains we have savoured through strength and conditioning training, as well as many other things we had embarked on, will truly fade away sooner than later. We are now rendered idle after putting in long hours of training," said Musa. He added that the team will continue with strength and conditioning when training resumes. "For the first time in many years, we have had uninterrupted training for almost a year. The strength and conditioning sessions have really come through because boxing training is headed the aerobics way," he said, adding that the Tokyo Games won't be a walk in the park. "We have two events before the  Olympics and our target is the podium. To achieve our objectives,  we need to prepare well. The morale in camp at AV Fitness Gym prior to the suspension order was all good and everything seemed to be on the right track," he said.
