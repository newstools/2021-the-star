Al Duhail striker Michael Olunga has described their 2-2 draw against Esteghlal as fair. The striker told the official club website he was satisfied with the outcome, especially coming from a closely contested match that could have easily gone either way. “Both teams presented a big match and focus was clear from our side and from Esteghlal's side and achieving one point from this match is not a bad thing," said Olunga. The 24-year-old striker, who joined the Qatar Premiership side from Kashiwa Reysol in the J1-League, said they need to train their eyes on the ultimate prize by remaining focused in their remaining matches. “There are still two matches left for us in the competition. We must continue to perform with focus and determination in order to win the qualifying card," he said. Olunga warned his teammates that their current status at the top of the group should not mislead them to sit on their laurels. “Although the team is still at the top of the group, the competition is fierce between Esteghlal, Al Ahly, and this seems clear from the slight difference in points between these clubs," said Olunga. The Harambee Stars captain urged his teammates to fire up ahead of their next encounter against Al Shorta, warning them in advance of an impending scathing battle. He, however, added he had a lot of faith in his teammates to rise up to the task. “The next match against Al Shorta will not be easy because it is a team that plays hard, which will be dangerous for us, but my teammates are able to deal with this matter and will work to come out with a positive result that will facilitate our mission in our last match,” he said.
