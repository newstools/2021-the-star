Fishers in Kitui can begin harvesting fish from 16 dams in the county in the next six months after the administration stocked them with 80,000 tilapia fingerlings. Each of the 16 dams got 5,00 tilapia fingerlings. They include Matinga dam in Kyuso ward, Katia (Mumoni ward), Kaiveti (Nguutani), Thokoa (Kyome/Thaana), Katuluni (Mui) and Kisole (Waita). The project is meant to create jobs and improve the livelihoods of Kitui residents. It is an initiative of the State Department of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Blue Economy. Kitui Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau launched the initiative on March 12. Livestock, Apiculture, and Fisheries Development executive Emmanuel Kisangau was present. James Songolo, the chief officer for Agriculture, Livestock, Apiculture, and Fisheries led officers from the ministry to stock dams in Mwingi North, Mwingi Central and Mwingi West subcounties. Songolo told farmers the county is committed to ensuring all earth dams are stocked with different fingerlings. (edited by o. owino)
