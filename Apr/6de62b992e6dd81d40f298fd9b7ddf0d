A man accused of killing his son by slitting his throat was on Friday arrested as he attempted to leave the country for Qatar. Nehemiah Asiago, 41, is accused of slitting the son's throat using a kitchen knife. He was arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Police said the suspect had engaged homicide detectives in a cat and mouse game since last year. Asiago is said to have had a domestic squabble with his son Byron before the incident occurred at Bomakombi village in Suneka, Kisii county in June 2020. Since then, Asiago is reported to have been secretly operating between Nakuru and Nairobi until Friday afternoon when the sleuths busted him as he was preparing to fly out of the country. Police said Byron’s brother told detectives a disagreement arose after their father who was intoxicated, demanded to know what he had brought home from his day at the local centre. Byron was jobless at the time. “Incensed by his father’s remarks, Byron posed a similar question to his father, asking him what he had to show for his day’s activities other than returning home in a drunken stupor. This prompted a scuffle, that led to his death,” the DCI said. Asiago is expected in court on Monday.  Edited by P.O
