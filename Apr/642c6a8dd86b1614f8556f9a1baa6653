Mombasa MCAs want the Health department to allocate a budget for menstrual hygiene management. In a motion tabled by Likoni MCA Athman Mwamwiri and passed by the house, the budget is for availability of sanitary pads for vulnerable girls and young women. "We have had complaints of young girls who cannot afford sanitary towels. This has led to some people taking advantage of them. Therefore the Health department should find a way to support the girls, which will also help to reduce early pregnancy cases,” he said. Mwamwiri said Mombasa has a high number of teen pregnancies and the girls need to be sensitised. Nominated MCA Mary Osongo said children are suffering because they do not get enough health services. "Some girls do not have money to buy sanitary towels. Some miss school and isolate themselves because of fear. That is why we want the centres placed in the six subcounties to support them,” she said. The MCAs also raised concern over lack of funding and equipment for youth-friendly health centres placed in each of the six subcounties to match the standards provided in the national guidelines. Containers were bought by the county government and placed in all subcounties to serve as adolescent and youth-friendly health centres. “Placement of these clinics in our subcounties has always been my concern but they have not met the required standards due to low health services being provided,” Mwamwiri said. He said the people providing services in the clinics are elderly contrary to expectations that they would be manned by younger people. Mwamwiri said the clinics should also have counsellors. The clinics lack funding and are not fully equipped to offer health services such as family planning. The MCAs asked the health department to allocate more funding for family planning to ensure more accessibility of health services, information and security to reduce unintended pregnancies among the youth.
