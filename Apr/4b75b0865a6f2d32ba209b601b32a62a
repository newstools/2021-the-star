The High Court has suspended the directive by the government to close the Daadab and Kakuma refugee camps that was issued late month. Justice Antony Mrima on Wednesday issued temporary orders staying the application and enforcement of the directive to close the Daadab and Kakuma refugee camps. In the case, former presidential aspirant Peter Gichira argued that the directive on the closure of the camps is illegal and violates international law and treaties on protection of refugee rights. He wants the court to stop the enforcement of the directive by government to close the two camps. "The actions intended by the directive are draconian and will expose the lives of innocent, helpless refugees to the danger of trauma, torture, harm and possible loss of life " Gichira says. He claims Interior CS Fred Matiang'i issued a directive on March 22 through a tweet in which he gave UNHCR 14 days ultimatum to shut down the camps. Gichira claims Matiang'i said there was no room for further discussions on the issue of closing the refugee camps despite the intended actions raising serious discussion on fundamental human rights and freedoms. The case will be mentioned on Tuesday next week for further directions.
