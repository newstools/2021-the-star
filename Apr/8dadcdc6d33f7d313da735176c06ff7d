Kenya Lionesses head coach Felix Oloo will be hoping to win the Solidarity Cup in Tunisia, starting this weekend. The event will run for two consecutive weekends in Tunis and the tactician will be hoping for a change in fortunes in North Africa after mixed performances in four tournaments in Madrid and Dubai. “It’s a tough learning curve for us. In the last two events, It has been crazy as we try out different combinations to see who fits where, and we hope in Tunisia everything will come together,” added Oloo. The Lionesses had an eight-day training camp at Moi Stadium, Kasarani, where they analysed the performance from the last event in Dubai with a view of improving their performance with two months left before the Tokyo Olympics. Felix Oloo’s charges will be up against Madagascar and Tunisia with the two opponents preparing for the repechage event in Monaco in June. Oloo will be delighted to have play-maker Grace Adhiambo back in the squad after she missed out the pre-Olympics warm up events in Madrid and Dubai as she was sitting her national examinations. The Nakuru RFC half-back was sorely missed considering her ability to open up defences and Oloo will be banking on those attributes in Tunisia. Skipper Philadelphia Orlando believes it’s time the side stepped up their efforts with time running out ahead of Tokyo. “We have had four events to adapt, learn and it’s not been easy especially with us not playing for a year. However, we must improve our play and be competitive,” added Orlando. Squad to Tunisia: Philadelphia Orlando (captain), Sheila Chajira, Christabel Lindo, Enid Ouma, Leah Wambui, Terry Ayesha, Janet Okello, Sarah Oluche, Grace Adhiambo, Sheila Wafula, Cynthia Camilla, Sinaida Aura, Diana Awino and Celestine Masinde.
