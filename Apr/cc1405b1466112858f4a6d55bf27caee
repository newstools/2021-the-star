Mombasa county is building parks, planting trees, placing flower pots and plants along the roads to beautify the city. Governor Hassan Joho's administration has rehabilitated the Railways Roundabout Park, Treasury Square Garden and is building another park adjacent to Nyali Bridge. The department of environment aims to put up at least one public park in all six subcounties, environment chief officer Ilhan Abbas said. She also said more than 100,000 trees will be planted. Railways Roundabout Park, which is among the oldest in the county, has received a major facelift after it was abandoned for many years. It was taken over by street families. “The Railways Park, where people used to sit as they waited for trains, was in very bad shape. We have now renovated it and it will become a tourist attraction," Abbas said. At the park, the county has put up a coffee house and seating for as many as 1,000 people. The garden can be used for public meetings and weddings — after the national government eases Covid-19 restrictions, such as bans on public gatherings. It will also have a  tourist information centre. Abbas said they had planned to open the park during the Easter holiday but had to postpone the launch due to the ban on public gatherings. “We will launch the park soon after the government eases Covid-19 restrictions,” she said. The department is also placing flower pots along city major roads and in the Central Business District. “We are going to place the flower pots all the way to the Moi International Airport. This is not only a project to beautify Mombasa, but also to communicate to the public the importance of clean environment,” she said. The county is working with youth groups to ensure the sustainability of the projects and maintain parks, trees and flowers. “We want this to be a people-driven project, not government-led initiative,” Abbas said. The department is also rehabilitating mangrove forests. (Edited by V. Graham)
