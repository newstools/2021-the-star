Some of the things Deputy President William Ruto is promising Kenyans are unrealistic. Can DP Ruto go to Gikomba market and pick a mama mboga (vegetable vendor) and make her a minister, for instance? I don’t think so. Even those people who have tried to work with the grassroots, the likes of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, have done so in a well-structured manner, informed by deep philosophy and ideology. If you read Gaddafi's Green Book, you will get more information on how he did this. It captures the feelings, the ideas and the vision of engaging people, ordinary people. In order to actualise that vision, Gaddafi moved with the people. He organised them into cells and other small groups because of the idea he had in mind. What is the DP telling us? What has he organised? I don’t see anything. And in terms of designing a manifesto, great nations are moved forward by ideas. Ideas come first before anything else. Ruto, as the team leader, should be the bearer of the vision. His role is to be a good leader. A model who people can follow. His work is to make people see his vision. Why he wants to be supported and where he wants to take them. If you look at evolutionary leaders around the world who have transformed their countries, even within Western democracies, they carry the vision. So, Ruto must bear the vision. He cannot go back to Gikomba market to ask people what he should do for them. This country requires vision – a big dream to transform it. Ruto should tell us ‘I have this dream and I want us to achieve this dream and this is how every sector of the society fits in my dream.’ He should say who and how he is going to recruit every person and sector into his movement going forward. But he cannot, so he is going to ask mama mboga how she wants to be governed. The University don spoke to the Star on phone
