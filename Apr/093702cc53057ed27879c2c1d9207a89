Matuga MP Kasim Tandaza has said he will engage detectives to probe claims that school heads collude with some parents to divert bursaries for other needy children. Tandaza said a single cheque is sent schools with multiple beneficiaries, but others were not getting the cash. "I have learnt with deep sorrow that some of the parents with the assistance of school heads steal bursary fees meant for other needy children," he said. Many parents have complained that the money did not reflect, yet some people had the funds deposited on their children's accounts. "I will have the DCI investigate the matter and such people be arrested and taken to court," he said. More than 12,000 needy students in college and high school apply for bursary fees each term in Matuga constituency. Some CDF committee bursary officers have also been accused of biased allocation of the cash. The lawmaker condemned the act, terming it an act of selfishness that has no place in society. Tandaza said he feels concerned when young energetic men flock his office only to seek cleaning jobs for lack of education. He urged young people to take advantage of technical and vocational training institutes to get job skills.
