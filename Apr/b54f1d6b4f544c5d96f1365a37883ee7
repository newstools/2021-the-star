Borussia Dortmund have their backs to the wall in the Bundesliga and host Werder Bremen on Sunday knowing only a win will do if they are to have any chance of salvaging something from their rollercoaster season. Dortmund were eliminated in the Champions League quarter-finals by Man City on Wednesday and their hopes of playing in Europe’s elite club competition next season are slipping away. The Ruhr valley club’s inconsistent domestic campaign has seen them drop to fifth place on 46 points, seven off fourth-placed Eintracht Frankfurt, with six matches remaining. The top four finishers advance to next season’s lucrative Champions League group stage. Coach Edin Terzic, who makes way for Borussia Moenchengladbach’s Marco Rose next season, has done an admirable job in righting the ship after taking over from Lucien Favre in mid-season. He has also led them to the German Cup semi-finals but is now faced with a season-ending sprint. “We will pick ourselves up now and pull ourselves together,” Terzic said after Wednesday’s 2-1 loss to Manchester City. “We will collect ourselves and recover and on Sunday we will give it everything we have so that we get another chance to do this again next year.”
