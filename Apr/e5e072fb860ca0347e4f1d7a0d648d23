West Pokot county has partnered with the Ugandan government in a drive to vaccinate 100,000 animals against contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP). CBPP is a highly contagious disease that affects cattle and water buffaloes. Affected animals have difficulty in breathing due to damage to the lungs. The six-day vaccination exercise is aimed at preventing cross-border spread of the disease. West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo said most of the animals from North Pokot region had migrated to Uganda in search of pasture and water and were now returning home, hence the need to vaccinate them. He said 24 veterinary officers will be involved in the drive. The county chief spoke after launching the exercise in Kaichom in Losidok and Asokonion village in Naparakocha Karita, both in Amudat District, Uganda. Amudat regional district commissioner Michael Pwalatum said the vaccination has come at the right time. “The exercise has met one of the resolutions made during the Entebbe meeting in Uganda to help cement peace,” he said. Pwalatum said one of the resolutions made was to ensure resource-sharing and other cross-border activities such vaccinating animals along the Kenya-Uganda border. He said the two regions depend on livestock and there was a need to protect them from diseases. Pwalatum said the exercise will improve cross-border collaboration and coordination. "The joint vaccination is meant to help improve our relationship with our neighbours and enhance peaceful coexistence,” he said. Lonyangapuo said the drive will eradicate diseases in the region and enable farmers to secure foreign markets for their animal products. “Most of our animals are sold to middlemen who later sell them in the western region and Nairobi, reaping huge profits,” he said. The governor said that his government intends to set up more projects along the border.
