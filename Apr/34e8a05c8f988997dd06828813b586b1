The National government alongside the  Machakos, Makueni and Kajiado county governments has put on hold  issuance of new development permits around Konza Technopolis for 90 days. The counties in a joint statement indicated the decision was reached to enable the formulation of a new  Inter-County Physical and Land Use Development Plan. The plan will provide guidelines and standards for regulation of land use practices and general development within the zone. Speaking at the joint meeting Interior Cabinet Secretary, Fred Matiangí said that there is need for governments to work together in protecting the ecosystem around Konza Technopolis to deliver value to investors and properties around the zone “Konza is evidence of what happens when government leaders at all levels work together and focus on things that matter,” Matiangi said. The meeting resolved to complete the buffer zone plan within the notice period so that resumption of developments on July 1 will be guided by the new plan. The plan will provide basic guidelines and standards for regulation of land use practices and general development while controlling activities for the respective counties bordering the Technopolis. It will also guide developers and property owners on acceptable standards. In addition, the three counties in consultation with the national government will provide a mutually agreed spatial development framework for symbiotic and sustainable co-existence between the Konza Technopolis and the adjacent areas falling within the jurisdiction of the three counties.
