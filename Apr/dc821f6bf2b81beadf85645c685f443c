Grammy award-winning group and Reggae Royalty Morgan Heritage will on Saturday drop three songs using a new technology called as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) powered by Bondly Finance. Speaking to Word Is, Morgan Heritage’s Mojo explained; “Non-Fungible Token is something that you can hold in the digital space. The music will be embedded in the digital art that we are releasing this Saturday. It will be a three-unit digital art and the songs will be playing in the background. people will be getting music before it goes for sale to everybody on the normal digital service provider [DSP] ie, Skiza, Apple music,” he said. The releases will be a new song and two digitally remastered titles from their vast catalogue. “With this kind of Partnership, we as Morgan Heritage will be able to have some of the Kenyan artists along the African ones to be able to connect to this kind of business as well.” All three tracks are records from the upcoming album Legacy, which will be released on May 28, 2021. The album not only covers the group’s illustrious career but also takes you on a musical journey that spans 60 years of Jamaican music and its evolution throughout.
