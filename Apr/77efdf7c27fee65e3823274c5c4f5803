Some 4,200 needy students have received Sh42 million bursaries courtesy of Makadara National Government-CDF. Area MP George Aladwa issued the cheques to the parents of students at his KCB House offices on Jogoo Road on Tuesday. "We have given bursaries to secondary school, college, university and special needs students," Aladwa said while issuing the cheques to the parents. Aladwa, who is also the chairman of the ODM Nairobi branch, said each student got Sh10,000 to support their education. The bursaries came as relief to many poor students who were at risk of dropping out of school owing to inordinate delays by the Treasury to release the cash. "We are very thankful to the government because finally the money is here. We have had some delays, of about two months and this really affected our students," Aladwa said. MPs have accused the national Treasury of jeopardising the future of poor children who rely on CDF bursaries for their education by delaying disbursement of funds. The legislators had threatened to stall the passage of a supplementary budget and the Division of Revenue Bill, 2021. "Children we support come from poor backgrounds. Their parents are poor. We have to support them to educate their children. The delay has really affected my people," Aladwa said. Speaking to the Star after receiving a cheque, Boniface Muli, father to Sharon Bula, a beneficiary, said the disbursement of the cash is a big relief to him . "I was worried because my daughter is going back to school next month and I didn't have money for fees. This has really helped me. With Covid 19, there is no work," Muli, who a resident of Viwandani Ward, said. Bula is a form three student at Ukia Girls school in Makueni.
