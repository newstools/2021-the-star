Africa producing its own vaccines in different places is a great step in the right direction, ODM party leader Raila Odinga has said. Raila who is also the AU envoy said Kenya can easily be the pharmaceutical and biotechnology hub of East Africa. "Climate Change is causing new and lethal diseases, so we need to act with speed," Raila said. According to WHO, Africa sits on the sidelines of the vaccination drive against Covid-19. The continent has so far been the least-affected by the pandemic. So far it has recorded over 4.3 million cases which include about 114,000 deaths. On Wednesday, the African Union announced a partnership to manufacture vaccines at five research centres to be built on the continent within the next 15 years. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations which helps run the global Covax coronavirus vaccine-sharing programme with the public-private alliance Gavi and the World Health Organization, signed a memorandum of understanding to boost African vaccine research and development as well as manufacturing. According to Aljazeera, the five centres will be located in the north, south, east, west and centre of Africa over the next 10-15 years. “Trusted partnership will be critical in advancing the vaccine manufacturing agenda on the continent,” he said. “The partnership with CEPI symbolises cooperation and collaboration to help respond to infectious disease threats and ensure Africa’s health security.”
