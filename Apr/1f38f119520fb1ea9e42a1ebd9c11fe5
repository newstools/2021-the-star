Early one morning, we arrived at the large dam next to No. 2 Junction. We found a majestic male lion relaxing next to the road. However, after a few minutes, the lion suddenly got up and crossed the road then started towards the dark horizon. As the dawn light slowly increased, we could see a large herd of buffalo forming a protective ring stance in the middle of the plain. Then suddenly, just next to the buffalo herd, I noticed the unmistakable profiles of at least five spotted hyenas. They appeared to be circling the buffalo herd for some unknown reason. Just as the lion appeared closer to the hyena, he was joined by two lionesses that must have been lying low in the grass. It was obvious these predators were after one of the buffalo, and it was definitely attracting a lot of predator attention. At times both the hyenas and lions ventured close to the buffalo herd, resulting in an aggressive buffalo reaction, as large bulls chased hyenas and lions. It is when watching scenes like this that thoughts like 'Who is the boss?' come to mind. The stalk-and-chase drama continued for some time as the hungry predators tried to break the protective circle. Then suddenly it was all over, the lion grabbed a newborn buffalo calf and killed it. No wonder the buffalo were being so protective. Watching the final killing moment was also sad. Even though lions need to eat, the tiny buffalo calf did not even get an opportunity to experience a meaningful life. So try something different. Visit the Nairobi National Park then find a buffalo herd. Approach carefully and enjoy God’s creation close-up. You never know, you might just witness another 'who’s the boss?' action moment.
