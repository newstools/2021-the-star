Mombasa MCAs want the county administration to label all drugs in public hospitals. In a motion tabled by Likoni MCA Athman Mwamwiri and passed by the house, the legislators said the drugs supplied in public hospitals are not given to patients as required. Mwamwiri said patients are always referred to buy drugs in private health facilities, which are allegedly owned by doctors serving in public hospitals. "The health department is one of the areas always allocated 100 per cent of their budget for the availability of drugs and good health services to the people. But today there are no drugs in our hospitals because cartels channel them through the backdoor to private hospitals,” Mwamwiri said. The MCAs said all drugs in government hospitals should have a label of Mombasa County Government to safeguard them from theft by cartels. Nominated MCA Amriya Boy said the health department is always given Sh3.7 billion, which is the highest compared to other departments, and it is important that the money is used in the correct way. "Health workers have their own clinics, so they misuse the drugs by selling public drugs to private facilities,” she said. She said that such reports of corruption should be taken seriously and reported to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. “It is so unfortunate that when you visit our hospitals you will go through all the treatment process but when you go take the drugs, you are told that there are no drugs.  The public is not getting good health services yet they are the taxpayers,” she said. Amriya said the thieves should be reported and punished to serve as a lesson to others. Mwakirunge MCA Feddis Salame said citizens are facing challenges, therefore there is a need to implement the motion in order to bring change in government hospitals. Tudor MCA Tobias Samba said: "The situation at Coast General Hospital is pathetic and therefore this matter should be treated with urgency in order to save lives of citizens.". Edited by Henry Makori
