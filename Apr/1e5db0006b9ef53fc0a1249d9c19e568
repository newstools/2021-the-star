A 24-year-old man on Monday shocked police officers at the Kisumu Central Police Station when he presented himself at the station with the head of his 70-year-old grandmother. The young man walled casually to the police station at around 3pm with the head put in a bucket. Police officers manning the station had initially thought he was at the station to see a relative held at the station or wanted to make a report. But they were shocked when the man asked the officers to check what he had was carrying inside the bucket. The suspect was immediately locked up at the station. He later led the officers, led by the OCS central police station to a tin-roofed semi-permanent house which they shared by the old lady at the sprawling Nyalenda Kilo estate. A neighbour who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity said the man had been living with her grandmother for several years at the estate. " His parents are said to have died and his grandmother took him in, " the neighbour said. The police are yet to establish what could have led to the bizarre incident that shook the entire estate. A police officer who was at the scene to pick up the remains of the grandmother said the suspect told them that he killed her to end her suffering. "He said he wanted her grandmother to rest," the officer said. According to the neighbors, the suspect left the estate at around 2.55pm carrying a bag and two buckets. He then left the house using a motorbike but nobody had any idea what he had done. It would later emerge that what he was carrying in one of the buckets was her grandmother's head, chopped of her body.
