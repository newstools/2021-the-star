Worship singer Jescar Karimi has released her latest single, titled 'Mungu Mkuu'. Karimi said she wrote it four years ago, from a point of acknowledging that God is great and greater than all other names. "In my ups and downs, I choose to exalt His Name. The recording and release of the song couldn't have come at a better time. Days preceding the 'Mungu Mkuu' video shoot were interesting." She said she had worked for almost two weeks and it was during this period while at work in the hospital that she got to launch the song with a patient in the isolation ward. "That one particular patient I ministered to also ministered to me with a word from Psalms 29, which happens to be one of my favourite." Karimi recorded her first single in 2014.
