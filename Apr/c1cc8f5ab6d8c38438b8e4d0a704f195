Eleven students graduated during the seventh Safaricom Youth Orchestra graduation ceremony on Sunday. The event was conducted virtually for the second year in a row. The students were awarded certificates in orchestral music, having learnt to play various instruments, ranging from the flute to alto sax, trumpet and violin. Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa said music education is highly beneficial to students’ well-being and development. “In line with our purpose of transforming lives, we are dedicated to continuously supporting and investing in music platforms, such as SYO and Ghetto Classics, that play a key role in uplifting the lives of young boys and girls,” he said in a statement. The Safaricom Youth Orchestra was launched in 2014 by the late Bob Collymore with the aim of bringing together gifted and talented students and tutors to make beautiful music. More than 130 students have graduated so far and progressed to pursue their university education, specialising in different disciplines. Cyndicate Kabei, SYO Class of 2021 graduate, said, “I started playing the French horn four years ago, when I joined the Ghetto Classics programme. I have also been a proud member of the Safaricom Youth Orchestra over the last three years. Music is an integral part of my life." Adding, "The orchestra has allowed me to nurture my talents, explore music and gain exposure with world-renowned artists in the industry. I would like to study classical music in university, and I cannot wait for the world to hear my songs.”
