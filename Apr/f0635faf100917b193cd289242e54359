Nigerian star and 'Maserati' hitmaker Olakira has dropped his latest single 'Sere' featuring WCB first lady Zuchu. 'Sere' pronounced Shere, is a Yoruba word meaning let's play. 'Sere' is a love ballad from Olakira and also the first single from his EP titled '4play' that will be out next month. The video was shot in Tanzania, directed by Director Kenny and audio produced by Simba Tagz, Sterryo and Drumatik. Olakira visited Kenya in November last year and expressed his target of featuring East African artistes in his projects. Talking to Word Is during his visit, he said, "I'd like to work with the likes of Sauti Sol, Otile Brown and Fena Gitu." Olakira said each of the songs in the EP is a banger that will blow your minds.
