Birthday wishes have poured in for Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru as she turned 50. Via social media on Friday, Waiguru said a person should build a strong support system. "Family and friends who stay true and remind you of what life is truly about are invaluable. They will keep you grounded," she said. "I am grateful to God for His goodness in my joys, successes and through my seasons of fires and darkest nights." Waiguru went on to share five lessons she has learnt in life. "1. Have an Anchor! Mine is God. Life will throw you twists and turns and in those moments of turbulence the anchor holds!" 2. Build a strong support system! Family and friends who stay true and remind you of what life is truly about are invaluable. They will keep you grounded. 3. Live laugh & love! Try new things often. Some of my most enjoyable moments have been driving across this country stopping at Nyama joints, chats with ordinary Kenyans all this in great company! My husband & I have driven to 37 counties We hope to cover the remaining 10 soonest. 4. Think of generational impact. Make your footprint extremely clear where you are for two reasons; One for legacy and two, so that those who come after you never have to guess where to step. 5. A special one for the women and young girls out there; we have lesser excuses and greater opportunities than those before us to make our voices heard! Letâ€™s make them and future generations proud!" Below are some of the tweets from Kenyans;
