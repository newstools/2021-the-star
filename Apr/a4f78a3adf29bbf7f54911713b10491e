Police in Baringo are pursuing a primary school head teacher who allegedly burned the face of his five-month-old son over a family dispute. The incident occurred in Ng'aratuko village, Baringo North, on Sunday evening. The man allegedly arrived home drunk and shoved the child's face on blazing fire. "He even turned deaf ear when I shouted requesting him to surrender my child so that I could flee away and leave his house," his wife Ann Kipyego said. She said he slapped and chased her away hurling insults and death threats. The child is being treated at the Baringo County Referral Hospital in Kabarnet. "My child was in good health before the incident. I used to breastfeed well, but now his eyes, nose and ears have been disfigured. I don't know if he will regain his shape when he heals," she said. Sibilo assistant chief Samuel Kamuren said on Wednesday the two have often been quarrelling, with the wife overpowering the husband whenever they fought. "He committed the act on suspicion that the child was not his own, believing that he had been conceived out of wedlock. He used to threaten he would kill the baby," Kamuren said. He said the man has over 10 children with his two wives who live about 50 metres apart. Ann said her husband should be arrested and jailed. County children's officer Irene Chepkwony visited the mother and child in hospital. Chepkwony condemned the incident, decrying the rise in cases of gender-based violence, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. "Definitely, the suspect should be arrested and charged to serve as an example to others," she said. Baringo North police boss Fredrick Odinga said police are searching for the teacher and he will be arraigned upon arrest.
