Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's daughters are working on a reality show to take their fans inside their charmed lives. The Mbuvi sisters, Saumu, Salma and Sandra, are working at debuting an online series on their lives. Saumu announced she had broken up with Lamu Senator Anwar Loitiptip early this year. Anwar is now married to model and influencer Aeedah Bambi months after their split. The Lamu senator confirmed the news by telling his fans, "Tembea nyumbani uone bibi harusi live live. Picha mitandaoni tunajua mahatters wanasubiri waanze kudiss but tuko rada." Salma is married and keeps most of her life away from the limelight. As for Sandra, she is loved by netizens for her savage take on life and doesnâ€™t suffer fools gladly. She tells them off and moves on with her life.
