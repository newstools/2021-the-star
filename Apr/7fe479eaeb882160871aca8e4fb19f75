The late Senator Yusuf Haji's son, Abdul Haji, will take over from his father in Garissa. In a Gazette notice on Tuesday, theÂ  IEBC made a declaration of no contest. "...and declares the person listed in the 1st and 2nd Column to the Schedule duly elected as the Senator, Garissa County," Chairman Wafula Chebukati said. Garissa Township MP Aden Duale thanked the people of Garissa for their support. "I want to thank the people of Garissa county political leadership.. women and the youth for honoring us, the late Haji and agreeing with our position to let Abdul complete the remaining term of his father's tenure," he said. "We pray that he will just be like his father.. congratulations to the senator elect." Garissa County is made up of three major clans namely Abduwak, Aulihan and Abdallah. Clans play an integral role in the endorsement of candidates who in most cases end up winning. Abdul, a renowned businessman, is featured among private arm holders who played a key role in the rescue mission during the Westgate Mall attack in2013. Abdul was among a small group that included plain-clothes policemen who helped to rescue dozens of people from the Westgate mall. He had gone in search of his brother, armed only with a pistol that his late father had taught him to hunt with as a child.
