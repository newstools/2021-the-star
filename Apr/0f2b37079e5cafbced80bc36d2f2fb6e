US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to virtually tour Kenya on Tuesday. This will be his first virtual tour of Africa where he will explore both Kenya and Nigeria while engaging with the youth through a video programme. In a statement shared on Twitter by White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs, it said that Secretary Blinken will be meeting Young African Leadership Initiative (YALI) alumni through an event dubbed 'Ten Questions with Tony'. "YALI alumni will have an opportunity to engage with the Secretary on a range of topics, including the role of youth in the future of Africa, economic development, democracy and good governance, climate change, and health," the statement read. YALI is an initiative utilized by the United States to work with public, private and civil societies across the continent to develop economic opportunities and support innovativeness of Africa's youth. According to the statement, Blinken's virtual trip to Kenya will be a celebration of Kenya- US 57-year bilateral relationship. The secretary is expected to meet with President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs Raychelle Awuor Omamo to reaffirm the two State's partnership and discuss future cooperation. Just three weeks ago, President Joe Biden telephoned President Uhuru for talks on the importance of strong ties between the US and Kenya. The White House in a statement said that Biden affirmed the importance of the strong bilateral relationship between the two countries. Biden, the statement reads, also emphasized the United States’ continued commitment to working closely with Kenya to support regional peace and security, including at the United Nations Security Council. The two leaders also discussed the deteriorating humanitarian and human rights crises in Ethiopia’s Tigray region. Washington said the discussion was centred on the need to prevent further loss of life and ensure humanitarian access to the region.
