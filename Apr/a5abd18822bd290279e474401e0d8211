Kenya has been nominated to host the inaugural 2021 Cecafa Women’s Champions League in July. Football Kenya Federation (FKF) CEO Barry Otieno said on Thursday the tournament will be held in Nairobi from July 17 to August 1. Kenya will host 10 countries including Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Zanzibar, Djibouti, Eritrea, Rwanda, and Burundi. Three-time FKF Women’s Premier League champions Vihiga Queens will fly Kenya's flag in the 15-day tournament. “In view of the foregoing and taking into consideration Vihiga Queens are the reigning champions of the local women’s Premier League, we are pleased to inform the western-based side that they will be the country's representatives in the Champions League,” said Otieno. Otieno urged Vihiga Queens to start early preparations for the inaugural tourney. The Alexander Alumira charges are sitting pretty at the summit of Zone B standings with 28 points from 10 matches.
