Former Harambee Stars skipper Musa Otieno has urged Kenyan footballers to use their income wisely so as to cushion themselves from any hardships that might arise in the future. Otieno is worried about the current trend where most ex-players have found themselves between a rock and a hard place, with quite a number being unable to meet basic needs. Otieno was weighing in on the plight of ex-Kenyan international Dennis Oliech, who recently revealed that he was encountering serious financial challenges in life after hanging his boots. “I think it’s just a matter of focusing. I was a senior while Oliech was the junior when he came in to the team. But I had that focus because I knew what I wanted and at the same time I was representing very many people. “And then you find that football is a very short career. Sometimes society wants you to live in a certain way because you are playing in South Africa or abroad, so instead of focusing on football you focus on other things like friends," he said, Otieno urged footballers to choose their friends wisely when nthe sun was still shining given most of them simply based their friendship on one's financial fortunes. "A good friend is the one that tells you to focus on your job first then afterwards you can do the rest. Right now we are only living a comfortable life because of the sacrifices we made back then,” he concluded. Otieno spoke only days after another ex-Kenya international Oliech shed light on his current predicaments after his fortunes took a sharp dip.
