Beatrice Nthenya, the 19-year-old KCSE candidate who was killed in the course of the examination period was buried at her parents’ home in Kavasya village Kitui rural sub-county on Saturday. Speaking to the Star, Kisasi sub-county police commander Micheal Ndonga within whose jurisdiction the killing happened said the suspected murderer who was in police custody would be arraigned in court on Monday. Michael Musyoka, 27, who was a student at Wote Technical institute in Makueni County had initially been admitted at the Kitui County Referral Hospital for stabbing himself in an attempted suicide soon after he stabbed Nthenya. Ndonga said he will not be required to plead to the charges as they will be making an application to hold him for a few days as we conclude investigations. “After we are done, we will formally charge him with murder.” Earlier, police said Nthenya was staying in a rented house at Mbusyani market with other female KCSE  candidates from where they walked to the exam centre every day until her boyfriend allegedly murdered her. Nthenya was allegedly stabbed twice with a penknife by her boyfriend following a disagreement two weeks ago. “The candidate succumbed to two stabs in the chest and the neck. The attacker and his victim hailed from Mbusyani location of Kisasi ward in Kitui Rural constituency,” Ndonga said then. He said after stabbing Nthenya to death, the assailant attempted to take his own life by stabbing himself two times in the chest and neck. He however survived.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
