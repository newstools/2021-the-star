Inter Milan manager Antonio Conte believes his side are 95 per cent of the way to winning their first Serie A title since 2010 following victory over Hellas Verona on Sunday. Matteo Darmian came off the bench to seal a 1-0 win at San Siro that left the Nerazzurri 13 points clear of AC Milan and Juventus at the top of the table. Inter have 79 points from 33 games, with Milan and Juve on 66, although their city rivals have a game in hand. “I see 95 per cent of the Scudetto conquered,” Conte told Sky Italia. “It has not been achieved yet. “But winning against a team that had nothing to lose and came to play openly brings us not three, not six, but nine points,” he added, emphasising the importance of the win. An Inter triumph would end Juve’s nine-year stranglehold on the league title, a run that 51-year-old Conte started as coach in Turin between 2011 and 2014. The Milanese club drew back-to-back games against Napoli and Spezia before the Verona win extended their unbeaten league run to 17 matches. “At this point, the ball starts to weigh more, because for many of these players it is the first time they have been this high,” Conte said. “After two great performances against Napoli and Spezia, we won and created different situations. It is inevitable that in situations where you are in front of the goalkeeper, the ball becomes heavier. “Winning this year means becoming a winner, and that is very important. Let’s not forget that the others are losing points, while we are not.”
