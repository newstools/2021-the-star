Tanzanian singer Ali Kiba did not celebrate his wife Amina Khalef on her birthday this year. Amina was celebrating her birthday, and the ‘Chekecha Cheketua’ hitmaker went missing in action on social media that day. She shared a long birthday message for herself, thanking Allah for life. "Privileged and grateful for being loved! Ya Allah, Thank you. Thank u for another year of life that u gave to me, I’m so grateful for all the things you’ve been giving me. Thank u to my family who never fail to show some love and care to me," she wrote. "Thank u to all my friends, who never forget me & always understand me. The Almighty, please give me more strength and patience to face all the challenges that lie ahead of me. Please help me in the days of the year ahead that I may make the best year for me yet. As for my birthday wishes for this year, nothing but safety, happiness & good health for all my loved ones. All my family & friends. Amin!" Days after Amina’s birthday was their marriage anniversary. The two, who have been reported to be having a rocky marriage, did not share anything on social media. The couple walked down the aisle three years ago in a posh private wedding attended by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho. In a past interview, Ali Kiba admitted that he and Amina have been having issues. "It is true that my wife and I have issues, which is normal to any couple. I returned her to her parents home," he said. This was after radio presenter Diva the Bawse admitted she had been dating the singer even after he was married to his Kenyan wife.
