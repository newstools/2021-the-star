President Uhuru Kenyatta seems to understand the weaknesses of the various political players he is engaging for next years election project. So well planned is his scheme such that he only needs to keep a studious silence and spring a surprise when they least expect it. Recognising the strength of ODM leader Raila Odinga in the Nasa brigade, President Kenyatta went for him first, then one by one started rapprochements with the remaining three. As he courted the three, he tactfully eased his tight pact with Raila occasioning a lot of noise from ODM's corner. They were left to curse the handshake and the BBI, even calling for the diversion of referendum funds to "more pressing matters" such as Covid-19, forget the fact that this is the line many Kenyans adopted as Raila garrulously pushed the BBI agenda. He has been so grumpy that the alleged change of heart caught many by surprise. But some analysts called him out for dishonesty. The ruse was peeled off and Raila had to come out to defend his pact with Kenyatta before the symbolic tour of town to ostensibly inspect on-going projects in Nairobi. The President, while deflating Raila in his former strongholds, is also making sure that he keeps him either hoping or enjoying the trappings of power. Raila could have played an increasingly important role, of robustly engaging the President role of policy dialogue on issues of national importance and workable approaches to vexing development matters, but that seems not to be a priority anymore. Even the ravenous pandemic plaguing the nation is mentioned as a matter of convenience rather than duty. Expectations are far from being met yet the government is engaging on double speak.
