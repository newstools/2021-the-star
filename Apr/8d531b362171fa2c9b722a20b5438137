A special unit has been formed to investigate the recent disappearance and killings of four men who were last seen at a club in Kitengela, Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai has said. Mutyambai on Friday said he had ordered the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to within a month investigate the incident and give him a report. “This morning, I directed the DCI homicide team to investigate this matter in order to get to the bottom of it. The team has already begun its work and will be expected to report to the IG on the entire matter within a month,” he said. The four friends, Elijah Obuong, Jack Anyango, Benjamin Imbai and Brian Oduor went missing on April 19 after a lunch meeting in Kitengela. Their car, a white Toyota Mark X, was found abandoned at a parking lot about 500 metres from the club the following day. On Wednesday and Thursday relatives positively identified the bodies of Imbai and Obuong. A third body found near Obuong's body in Murang'a is yet to be identified while the fourth one is yet to be found. Mutyambai spoke at the National Police College in Kiganjo on Friday amid growing speculations how the four men vanished shortly after meeting for lunch at a pub in Kitengela. The family of Jack Onyango, who is among those reported missing, said on Friday that the body found in the Mathioya river on Thursday was not Onyango’s. This deepened the mystery on where the bodies of Onyango and Oduor could be. Police had recovered the third body after being informed of the same by sand harvesters.. The body did not have upper limbs and is lying at the Murang’a County mortuary. Obuong’s body was on April 20 found in River Mukungai which is just a few metres away from River Mathioya and taken to the same morgue. This was a day after their abduction by unknown people. Imbai’s body was on April 20 found in Kieni forest, Gatundu North constituency and taken to the Kago Road General Funeral Home. A search on the other missing bodies is ongoing.
