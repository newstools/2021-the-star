Could this be the last-gasp effort at salvaging BBI, or would it be the epochal moment its initiators painstakingly promised Kenyans? Will it survive the current legal tumult and political intrigues? The roadblocks erected in its path are selfish, to say the least. When two groups emerge over a document that enjoyed a semblance of amity, albeit cosmetic,Â  at its formative stages, it becomes clear we will never find the right solutions to the myriad problems we face. If we continue initiating selfish projects at public expense. First, time and patience could be running out but more poignantly, the timing and marketing were wrong and now the steam seems to have hit its lowest ebb. There is neither impetus nor euphoria, as the country seems more consumed by existential matters. This is worrying its initiators, who incidentally, was on the same path but with different ends in mind. The tension in its wake is a grim testimony to bad political optics we are witnessing in the country ahead of the next general election. The wind is clearly taken out of the sails of political oligarchs who thought they had laid succession plans well in advance. Their frustrations will be seen in their miscalculations on policy, legal reforms and administrative decisions as the country moves closer to the general election, with unwarranted and valueless spending. It won't be easy to take the country back to the right footing with the same mentality that has landed us in the current ditch. By defending the indefensible, we lose focus on the most intricate things and create a false aura around individuals who later take advantage of our gullibility. The emerging lack of vision and leadership in a constitutional amendment, filling and/or reconstituting of the IEBC and the succession matrix are all pointers to a dangerous trajectory. The country could be on the cusp of a major dilemma if the debt crisis is factored in. The writer is an economic and political analyst (Edited by V. Graham)
