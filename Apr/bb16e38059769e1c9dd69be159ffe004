Vihiga will by June receive Sh300 million from the National Treasury for investment in climate change, Environment chief officer Richard Boiyo has said. This comes a month after planning committee members on climate change were elected at the ward level. The county is now training the committee members on how to identify climate change opportunities. The training is being undertaken by the climate change directorate at the county level in partnership with the Kenya Devolution Support Program (KDSP) and the World Bank. “The origin of growth at ward level depends on climate planning committees. This training will enable you to understand how the committees operate, I want you to be able to write bankable proposals that will convince the World Bank to fund your projects,” Boiyo told the committee members on Wednesday in Mbale. Governor Wilber Ottichilo had earlier said counties that will generate proposals that meet World Bank standards will get more funds. The committee members were also trained on resource mobilisation, governance and accountability, project monitoring and reporting. Boiyo said they have established climate change planning committees in five wards - Chavakali, Jepkoyai, Muhudu, Luanda Township and Wodanga. He said planning committees for the  remaining 20 wards will be established before the year ends.
