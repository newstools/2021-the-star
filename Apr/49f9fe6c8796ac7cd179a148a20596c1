Three of the six nominees to the Kitui County Public Service Board who were last year rejected will now be vetted after they reapplied. Francis Kiliku, David Munyao, Joseph Kyavoa were rejected in May after Governor Charity Ngilu presented their names to the Kitui assembly for vetting and approval. They, however, reapplied for the same jobs to a special panel that was put in place last February to recruit a chairperson and members of the board. The three were to be vetted alongside other nominees Jane Kibati, Esther Muthui and Bernard Munyasya. The assembly rejected the group, citing a lack of proper human resource management qualifications as well as moral and ethical issues facing some. In a report by the vetting committee headed by speaker George Ndotto that was tabled in the assembly by majority leader Peter Kilonzo, the committee recommended the approval of the appointment Munyasya, but the full house overturned the proposal, throwing the entire list out. Although Munyasya and Muthui had re-applied for the CPSB job, the special panel under the chairmanship of Necodemus Kisengese did not clear them and did not, therefore, forward their names to the assembly for vetting. In the initial list presented to the assembly last year, Kiliku was vetted for the position of CPSB chairman, but he will now be vetted as a member as Florence Mwanzia is proposed to be the CPSB chairperson. Other new names to face the assembly vetting committee include Wilfred Tumbo and Hassan Mutubwa. In a public notice advert on Thursday, the Kitui county assembly invited the six nominees to appear before the vetting committee on April 8, 2021. The notice also urges members of the public to provide written statements on oath and with evidence to the Kitui assembly clerk if they wish to contest the suitability of the listed candidates. “The public is further encouraged to attend the approval hearings on the date and place indicated above,” summed the public notice.
