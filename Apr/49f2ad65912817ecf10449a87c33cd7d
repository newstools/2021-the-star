Two suspects linked to fake currencies in Nairobi’s Kilimani estate have been remanded for five days pending investigations. Kibera court magistrate Phillip Mutua allowed investigators the requested days to complete investigations against Simon Maina Wakaba and Bonface Mungai Mwaura. Investigating officer Stephen Kibei told the court the suspects were arrested at Makaazi apartment in Nairobi. Their arrest followed reports that they were in possession of fake currencies. When the police arrived at the house, they recovered six locked steel boxes, several steel safes, two bottles and a reflective jacket. Detectives told the court they also recovered a jerrycan containing unknown liquid, KRA customs reflective jacket, National Treasury stickers and printing machines. They also recovered fake US dollars in 100 denominations totalling Sh6.8 million and fake Euros in 100 denominations amounting to Sh490,000. The officer also seized Sh6.4 million in 1,000 denominations, five mobile phones, several Sim cards and CDs that have been taken for forensic analysis. While seeking more days to hold the suspects, the detective said they wanted to liaise with Interpol to ascertain whether they were wanted persons. But the suspects' lawyer objected to the application on the grounds that it lacked merit. The matter will be mentioned on May 4.
