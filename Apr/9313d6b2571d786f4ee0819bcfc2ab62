Deputy President William Ruto’s meeting with Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya came in the wake of growing speculation that Raila-Ruto political alliance is in offing. While confirming that the meeting took place in Masai Mara, Narok county, Oparanya said he informed Raila when he ‘bumped’ into DP. A day later, Oparanya met Raila to brief him about their discussion accompanied by Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa. Sources indicated that besides devolution matters, Western politics also featured. Two of DP’s ardent defenders, former ministers Mwangi Kiunjuri and Rashid Achesa, attended the meeting. By virtue of his position as the deputy party leader, Oparanya was a key player in pushing the agenda of the handshake and Building Bridges Initiative. But lately, ODM leadership has changed tune and Oparanya set the ball rolling when he said the June referendum in not tenable, which appeared to support Ruto’s position on BBI. This prompted Raila to convene a meeting of ODM central management committee at his Karen home, where the party reiterated that the BBI reggae was still on course. It seems there are some political games being played. In the wake Ruto-Oparanya meeting, it is important to note that in politics, there are no permanent friends and enemies, only interests. Raila and Ruto have previously worked together. But two questions come to mind. But will the two manage to put aside their personal/political ambitions and egos? If yes, who will be the presidential candidate? If the unity deal comes to fruition, then I am sure many Kenyans are likely to interpret Raila’s move as a betrayal to the handshake and President Kenyatta.
