Uasin Gishu county leaders have called for public participation before the introduction of new administrative units. Governor Jackson Mandago said the Interior ministry should halt the process of introducing new divisions and locations in Uasin Gishu and first call for public participation. "As leaders of this county,  we want to put it clear that we were not consulted, let alone the public," Mandago said in Moiben. "For this reason, we have already petitioned Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to stop that exercise." He said there should be consultations where leaders and the public will agree on the modalities of the new administrative units that will govern them. “If we can discuss this as leaders, we will come up with a consensus and a solution will be found,” Mandago said. Uasin Gishu assembly chief whip David Sing'oei said residents should be consulted on such matters. "The governor was not consulted, the assembly was not consulted and definitely, the people of Uasin Gishu were left out,” Singoei said. Cheptiret/Kipchamo MCA Gilbert Tenai said the people of Uasin Gishu must give their opinions on the administrative units. "...sadly, the people were not asked what they think about the new units." Politician Jonathan Bii said, "The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is the only lawful entity to conduct boundaries review." "The IEBC should be given space to undertake its duty, then public participation will be held for the public to present their opinions. The one by the Ministry of Interior is just illegal and elicits questions."
