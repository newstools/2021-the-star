The DCI detectives based in Nakuru have discovered a 1/4-acre plantation suspected to be of prohibited plants in London, Nakuru County. The plant suspected to be Cannabis Sativa was fully grown and was only awaiting harvest. Three suspects namely Victor Kung’u Wainaina, Broddus Wainaina Kung’u, and Dennis Matete were arrested as sleuths raided a gated plot following a tip-off from members of the public. A multi-agency security team led by Nakuru Anti-Narcotics sleuths stormed into the compound and destroyed what would have been a bumper harvest for the owners. The value of the destroyed plantation is approximated to be Sh15 million. The suspects are currently in custody awaiting arraignment in court. This comes as the attempt to legalise marijuana continues to gain momentum in the country. In February, Dagoretti South MP John Kiarie renewed calls for Parliament to craft a law legalizing the industrial and medicinal use of marijuana. The lawmaker said the country can no longer be blind to its economic benefits. Kiarie argued that there was a need to review the country’s agriculture concept to net into the benefits of the non-conventional crops. “It is time we stopped being cowards as a house and start looking at crops that will be of benefit to this country,” Kiarie said. “It is, therefore, the time we also considered the legalization of marijuana in this country. I am talking about knowing that marijuana is pest resistant.”
