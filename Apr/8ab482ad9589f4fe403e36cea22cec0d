Today is a slow day at Jiji Ndogo Police Post. I know what you’re thinking. When is it ever not, right? Anyway, to whittle the hours away, Sophia and I get talking. For the first time, she asks me about my family. I tell her about my mother and Kanini and her brood. She knows a little about Kanini from the ongoing rape case against Kimondo. “I don’t know who my father is,” Sophia tells me. “All my mum would tell me is that he was a policeman.” “Where was he posted?” “In Nairobi. Been looking for him all my life.” I feel for her. I wonder whether that’s the reason she’s always so aloof about her personal life. I also wonder why she’s opening up to me now. “I don’t know,” she says. “And that’s a stupid question to ask someone when she’s being vulnerable.” “I’m sorry. I’m not very good at this stuff.” “Men aren’t good at anything.” “You’re damn right, sister,” a woman says from the door. “This one won’t even pay rent.” A man walks in behind her, looking like he just lost a fight with a chicken. “What happened to you?” I ask the man. He points to the woman. “I was searching him for rent money,” says the woman. “He is your tenant?” Sophia asks. “Yes. And for the last six months he’s paid no rent.” “Is that true?” Sophia asks the man. “No. I’ve been paying promptly as per our agreement.” I’m beginning to tire of this he-says, she-says stuff. “Lady,” I say, “do you have a rental agreement we can look at? And you sir, show us the receipts for the payments you’ve made.” “Well,” says the woman, “it was a verbal agreement. He was to live in my house and pay me three times a week.” “Two times a week!” says the man. “That was the agreement. The extra third time was like a bonus.” “You only say that cos you couldn’t deliver. Sometimes even the two times before your so-called bonus the payment wouldn’t be good enough.” The woman is all over the man’s face. Sophia separates them. “Do you want him to leave,” she asks, “or pay what he owes?” “If he gets caught up, he gotta keep up his payments.” “Did you manage the twice a week you claim?” Sophia asks the man. “I did. Promptly.” “Promptly? Sometimes I had to wait all night without a payment.” I turn to the woman. “All night?” “I meant all day,” she says. “And night. You know what I mean. Waiting for payment until the following day.” “You’re such a liar. I never paid you during the day. Not once.” “Enough!” Sophia separates them again. She looks at the woman. “How many payments are due?” The woman counts on her fingers. “At least eight this month.” “I paid you once this month already,” the man protests. “Okay. Seven.” “If he makes a payment right now,” Sophia asks, “will you let him stay until he’s caught up?” The woman frowns. “Right now?” “Right now, right here.” Sophia turns to the man. “Can you make at least one payment?” Both the man and woman look down and laugh. “What’s so funny?” I ask, getting pissed off. “My partner is trying to resolve your issue and you’re laughing?” “Dude,” says the man, “she wants me to make a payment here.” “So? Don’t you have it?” “I do, actually.” “Then pay already.” “Okay.” The man begins removing his trousers. “What’re you doing?” Sophia asks, alarmed. “Making a payment. Like you said.”
