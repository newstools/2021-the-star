Diamond Platnumz says she is enjoying her life after separating from her husband Mziswa three months after their wedding last year. Speaking to Wasafi media, Esma said she is enjoying her freedom and waiting for the divorce process to finalise. “I am enjoying. I have no one who asks me about anything, I do everything when I want to. Right now, I’m focusing on my business, I don’t have a man. I am single.” Esma said her focus is on cleaning her profile that she had dirtied previously. “I do not want a man anymore and I am in the process of getting a divorce. My lawyer is handling everything. There’s nothing good in life than having freedom. I am no one’s wife.” Esma was married to Mziswa as the third wife. The businessman is currently living in South Africa. Edited by T Jalio
