The Orange Democratic Movement has dispelled reports that Deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya is set to abandon the party to join Deputy President William Ruto’s hustler movement. In a statement, the party said Oparanya, who is also the Kakamega governor and the party’s point man in Western Kenya is a loyal member and ardent supporter of his boss, party leader Raila Odinga. “Oparanya has not been on any mission of betrayal as some people may want it to look. Sometimes in politics, it is good to learn what your opponent is plotting and be able to get the best defence to counter them,” read the statement. The party however admitted that Oparanya, indeed, has held a few meetings with the Deputy President. “In all instances, Oparanya has been briefing our ODM party leadership including the party leader on every detail of his discussion with Ruto,” the statement added. “Our ODM members and supporters should therefore not read any mischief in the said meetings  held with the DP” Ruto, in an interview with Citizen TV on Thursday, said he has met Oparanya not once but probably five times. “We have discussed with him how we can work together and how he appreciates the hustler narrative and the bottom-up approach,” he stated. He made the revelation about a week after he held a meeting with Oparanya at the Mahali Mzuri camp in Masaai Mara Game Reserve. Oparanya, however, said the meeting had not been planned and was just sheer coincidence. Nonetheless, Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua has insisted that Oparanya was the first one to approach the Ruto with the aim of joining the hustler movement. He said the governor had already boarded the hustler station train and that it was a matter of time before real politics kick in.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
