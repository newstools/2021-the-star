Mombasa county assembly on Tuesday passed a motion to allow street food vendors to do their businesses around mosques during Ramadhan. In a session chaired by Deputy Speaker Fadhili Makarani, the MCAs said the Covid-19 pandemic has rendered so many people jobless, therefore it is only prudent to allow them to sell their products around mosques. Street food vendors are among the people who have been affected by the measures introduced by the national and county governments to curb the spread of Covid-19. Mombasa has approximately 300 mosques. During Ramadhan, Muslims break their fast in the evenings and usually eat snacks outside the mosques before heading home for main meals. Tabling the motion before the house, Likoni MCA Athman Mwamiri, said unemployment brought about by Covid-19 has been one of the major challenges. “The Department of Trade, Tourism and Investment should allow food vendors on the streets as they observe Ministry of Health protocol on combating Covid-19,” he said. Mwamiri said the majority of the street food vendors are women, youth and people living with disabilities and they should be allowed to do their business to cushion them from the negative impact of Covid-19. He said allowing traders to sell their products outside the mosques in the evening will not only help them but also help in boosting the county’s economy which has been affected by the pandemic. “As leaders, we have the responsibility of ensuring we come up with measures to ensure we cushion our people from the negative impact of Covid-19.” “However, those who will be allowed to sell food outside mosques must adhere to Ministry of Health protocols,” Mwamiri said. Junda MCA Raphael Bwire said many people lost their jobs and now they depend on small businesses to generate income. Nominated MCA Mary Naliaka said the vendors will be selling their foodstuff to those who will attend the evening prayer session and those who opt to take it away as dinner.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
