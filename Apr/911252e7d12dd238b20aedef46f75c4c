AFC Leopards captain Robinson Kamura said on Sunday the club will continue to fight tooth and nail this season to charge for the title once the competition resumes. Speaking during the FKF Premier League talk show 'Juice Box', Kamura was emphatic that the 13-time Kenyan champions had their eyes firmly trained on the ultimate prize and they will go full throttle to reclaim their past glory. “You'll be seeing a new rejuvenated side, quite different from what you had gotten used to. I believe you've already observed some changes in the few matches we've played so far. “We are approaching the league differently this time around. We are not merely passive participants but rather real title contenders. And that's why we are taking each game at a time,” said Kamura. The current squad is under intense pressure to deliver the coveted silverware after staying out in the cold for several years. Club chairman, Dan Shikanda, promised to clinch the league when his administration assumed office last year and Leopards' winning streak only serves to underline his ambition. Kamura was remorseful over the red card he collected during their league outing against Bandari at Mbaraki but said he had learned some vital lesson from the incident. “Getting a red card is part of football and any player might fall victim to circumstances. But what's important is it was an important lesson in my career,” he said.
