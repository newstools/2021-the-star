Members of the County Assemblies Caucus now claim that politicians are hiding under minor errors in the BBI Bill to hijack the process of the law change. Led by Meru County Assembly Majority Leader Victor Kareithi, the leaders denied claims that different versions of the Bill were debated at the assemblies. Kareithi stated that the said errors were minor and should not be blown out of proportion. "The people have spoken, and the county assemblies have spoken. Parliament and the courts must now allow the people to have the final say at the referendum," Kareithi said. "We wish to reiterate this is a popular initiative and politicians and other partisan interests must not attempt to hijack the process. It did not start with them, it will not end with them." The leaders said Attorney General should be allowed to correct the typographical errors so far identified in the document. This comes on the day the chairman of the Senate team that considered the BBI Bill Okong'o Omogeni has handed over its report to the speaker Kenneth Lusaka. The short ceremony took place at the Parliament buildings on Monday. The Senate Justice and Legal Affairs Committee that worked jointly with its counterpart in the National Assembly concluded the report last Friday. While receiving the document, Lusaka said he's consulting with the House leadership and his National Assembly counterpart Justin Muturi on when to convene sitting to debate the report. The special sittings that were tentatively slated for this week were aborted following sharp divisions in the joint committee of the National Assembly and Senate.
