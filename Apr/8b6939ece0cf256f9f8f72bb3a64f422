Football Kenya Premier League (FKF) side Nzoia Sugar chair Evans Kadenge has lamented that many footballers are suffering financially and physically due to suspension of sports activities countrywide. Kadenge said Kenyan football is in an unprecedented  financial crisis, which may worsen if the coronavirus pandemic does not abate to allow local football leagues  to resume. “We are not just talking about our players but also the country at large. Our neighbouring countries are playing, just like the whole world. If we don’t resume, we will fall down the Fifa rankings.  I am humbly requesting the government to open up sports because training helps players to keep fit,” Kadenge said. Echoing his chairman's sentiments, club skipper Peter Juma said football is a source of joy and a daily bread for many footballers without which many have been affected psychologically. "Football is where we earn our living and we want sports, especially football, to resume as soon as possible. We don’t have any other source of income apart from it," Juma said. The two were part of the Nzoia Sugar family at Bungoma Referral Hospital to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. “After this mass vaccination exercise for both players and technical bench, I urge the government and the federation to have a serious discussion on sports resumption,” Kadenge said.
