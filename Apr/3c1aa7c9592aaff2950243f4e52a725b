Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) coach Sammy Kiki is convinced he can return the porters back to their old good days. The tactician said they had found some touch in the team but the suspension of the league will now drag back the gains made so far. KPA are unbeaten having won their three away premier league ties against Kenya College of Accountancy (KCA) University, Emyba and Kisumu Lakeside. The porters made the trip to Nairobi for two matches against Strathmore University and champions Ulinzi Warriors only for sports to be suspended. “We were ready for those games. I think in my opinion we were the only team that had trained well so far, and starting again will affect our chemistry,” Kiki said. He said: “We had hit the momentum but now with this break, we will have to start all over again.” Kiki is convinced KPA, who won the inaugural league crown in 1987, are on the right track to bag another silverware since their last one in 2018. To achieve that feat, Kiki said, he has made good signings that will see them return to the top once again. Kiki, a former porters play-maker, recruited center Nick Ogol from Umoja, shooting guard Benjamin Muga (Thunder) and point-guard Lennox Wanje (Coastal Kings). He remains hopeful that play-maker Keegan Oyugi will rejoin the team once he returns back home from USA. “We are in constant talks with him. He has assured me that he will be back to the team. His presence will be a real boost.”
