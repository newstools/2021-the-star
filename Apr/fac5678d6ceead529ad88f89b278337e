Veteran actor Pascal Tokodi has received congratulatory messages from fans after he put up a post on social media suggesting his wife Grace Ekirapa is expectant. Pascal, who was celebrating her birthday, recounted how he met Grace at a Java hotel. "I remember staring at you as you looked for a place to sit... I was speechless that day, you must have noticed cause you looked up and smiled at me. I smiled back and that was the beginning of everything for me," he wrote. "You'll make a wonderful mother and I can't wait to make you one." Speaking to Word Is, Pascal neither confirmed nor denied if they were expecting to be parents. He said, "I will be a brilliant dad but I will not comment if we are expecting or not. What if it is true, what if it is not?"
