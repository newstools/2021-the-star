Gospel singer Joyce Omondi shared a photo wearing a red dress that impressed her fans, especially the way she posed with so much class. However, one minor detail of the photo was captivating. She appeared very much pregnant and fans were excited to find out if indeed she was welcoming baby number one. But the singer has denied the pregnancy claims, saying the dress made her look like she had a baby bump “So it seems the ruching at the waist of the dress in my latest post has people seeing their things. God’s timing will be best. Thank you for all the love nonetheless.” Fans, however, persisted with the congrats. “Everyone is really praying for you. The pose gave everyone in the comment section a totally different idea. May God meet you soonest, Joyce. You rock girl,” wrote Gaceri Kamum. Another fan, Kiptoo Kibet, wrote, “Congratulations and good job, Joyce. Thanks Waihiga Mwaura for not failing the #BoyChild. Chairman Jackson Kibor is all smiles all the way from the city of champions, Eldoret. Magnificent.” Joyce Omondi is married to Citizen TV's Waihiga Mwaura and the two held their wedding in December 2015.
