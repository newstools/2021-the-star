A burglar who has been scaling walls in Nairobi apartments and stealing electronics, money and jewellery has been arrested. The suspect infamously known as 'Spiderman 3' was identified as Kennedy Otieno Oyier. Kennedy is the brother of another suspect, John Otieno Oyier, who was arrested in January this year and charged with burglary. John is in remand at the Industrial Area Prison, police said Monday. Kennedy was arrested on Sunday night following increased burglary cases in Kileleshwa, Parklands, Lavington, Muthangari and Westlands. He had been on the run for the past weeks. He moved after his brother was arrested. Kennedy told police they learnt scaling walls from a movie they watched online. He said they have broken into many houses using metal rods and master keys. Their best timing is weekends, mornings, late in the night and when occupants are away. After his arrest, Kennedy led officers to his house in Kawangware where laptop bags and two vehicles were recovered. The cars were towed to Kilimani police station. The suspect was expected to be arraigned with a miscellaneous application for detention to assist police with investigations. Police want those affected to visit the station for further processing. The arrests followed a series of incidents in the areas where residents lost their valuables and cash. Police believe he has been working with some guards of the affected apartments. Police stations in the affected areas have been receiving up to five complaints of burglary every weekend, prompting an operation. Nairobi police boss Augustine Nthumbi said they are investigating to establish if the suspect is linked to other incidents that have been reported elsewhere. “We are looking for more suspects who we believe were in the cartel,” he said.
