The Africa Film Academy is accepting entries for the 17th edition of the Africa Movie Academy Awards (AMAAs). The submissions period is now open until July 31. Nominations will be announced on September 30, while the event will be held in November. The Academy invites filmmakers to submit their feature, short, animation and documentary works for consideration in nearly 30 film categories of the awards. In 2020, the awards were held virtually due to the ravaging Covid-19 pandemic and was joined by filmmakers from different part of the world. During the event, Nigeria’s “The Milkmaid”, which was directed by Desmond Ovbiagele, walked away with four awards, winning NFVCB Award for Nigerian Best Film in the process.
