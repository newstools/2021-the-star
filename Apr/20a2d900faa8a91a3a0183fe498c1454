Tanzanian singer Harmonize says he can't stand being single. The bongo star says he will either get back with his Tanzanian girlfriend Jacqueline Wolper or his Italian wife Sarah Michelotti. He wrote on Instagram, "I can't keep up with this single life. I want to go back home, I have two houses, where should I go back to? Uchagani (referring to Wolper) or Italy (referring to Sarah)?" In another post, he said he wanted to start another chapter. The singer has, however, had dramatic fallouts with all his exes. His first public girlfriend was actress Wolper. He cheated on her with Sarah Michelotti, whom he married before cheating on her with actress Frida Kajala, whom he broke up with after hitting on her daughter, Paula Kajala. Edited by T Jalio
