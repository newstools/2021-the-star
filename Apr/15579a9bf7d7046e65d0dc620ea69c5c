A man who paid bride price for a 16-year-old girl was on Wednesday charged with defilement at a Kibera court. The parents of the complainant are yet to be arrested. Raphael Lekinunit denied the charges before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki. Court papers say he committed the offence between January and March in Hardy area of Lang’ata subcounty within Nairobi. A police report says Lekinunit convinced the girl to pack all her belongings and follow him to Nairobi. She followed the suspect to Hardy where they stayed together as wife and husband until a neighbour spotted the child and reported to the police. The police report says Lekinunit said he had already paid bride price to the girl’s parents. He asked the court for a lenient bond terms. "I cannot afford even Sh100. I ask the court to grant me a lenient bond terms," he said. The magistrate ordered him to be released on Sh300,000 bond. He directed the case to be mentioned after two weeks.
