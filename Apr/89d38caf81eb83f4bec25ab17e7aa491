Kenyan athletes will not be ready for the World Under 20 championships if the indefinite suspension of sports activities is not lifted any time soon, Athletics Kenya Nyanza North chairman Joseph Ochieng has said. Kenya is scheduled to host the rescheduled event between August 17 and 22 at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The global event was supposed to be held last year but was pushed to this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 10 days ago, President Uhuru Kenyatta — in his address to the nation — suspended sporting activities as one of the measures the government is taking in the fight against the 'third wave' of the coronavirus. “By now, the identified athletes should be in camps across the country. It is possible to maintain Covid-19 containment measures while in camp as they prepare. Athletics is a non-contact sport which should be allowed to go on,” said Ochieng. He appealed to the Ministry of Sports, Athletics Kenya and Ministry of Health to explore ways of opening the camps. “As we stand, our athletes are not prepared for the event. They should be at their respective camps preparing for the championships because I’m aware that other countries are preparing despite the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. “Kenya has been dominating youth and junior events at the international level and it would be shameful if we were to be beaten at home due to poor or lack of preparations. That’s my biggest worry.” In November last, AK held a two-day pretrial at Nyayo Stadium and Ochieng opines that athletes who took part in the events and are not doing their Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations should be in camps.
