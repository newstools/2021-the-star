Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga has criticised Alego-Usonga MP Samuel Atandi's remarks that Barack Obama's US presidency did not benefit residents of Kogelo. Kogelo village in Alego-Usonga is the ancestral home of Barack Obama, the father of the former US president. Atandi on Tuesday told Radio Mayienga Kogelo got a raw deal despite having links with the former President Obama. On Friday, Rasanga said the MP's remarks were ill-thought out and unfortunate. “I heard the MP utter unfortunate comments about the former president of the US who has roots in our county. The unfortunate comments must be condemned,” Rasanga said. He said it was wrong to expect development goodies from the former US president who is not a Kenyan. Atandi made the remarks when paying tribute to Mama Sarah Obama who was laid to rest at her Kogelo village home on Tuesday. She died at a Kisumu hospital on Monday aged 99. She was the former US president's grandmother. “The MP should not have waited until Mama Sarah to pass on to issue such statements. If he had any issue with any of the Obamas, he should have looked for a better avenue to channel his displeasure,” Rasanga said. South East Alego MCA Joseph Mboha in whose area Kogelo village told the MP that the Ndori - Kogelo - Ngiya road was tarmacked because of the Obamas. “It is not right to claim that our area did not gain from the former president. The trading centre in Kogelo is more vibrant today, teeming with international tourists who just come to trace his roots. These visitors spend money in the area whenever they visit which boost the local economy,” Mboha said.   (edited by o. owino)
