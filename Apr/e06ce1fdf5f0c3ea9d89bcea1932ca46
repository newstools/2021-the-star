Kenya Cup debutants Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology will use the current suspension of sporting activities across the country to rebuild after a winless start to their campaign. Head coach Ochieng Ahaya plans to add a few experienced players to complement his young charges who endured a thorough beating from Kabras RFC and Nakuru Oilers before the third wave of the coronavirus forced a halt to all sporting activities. “We began our campaign against some of the toughest and favourite sides that have not given us a good welcome in the Kenya Cup. However, the losses revealed to us what is expected in this campaign. We want to take advantage of the break to strengthen our weak points,” the former Kakamega High School coach said. Ahaya said the team boasts some of the most talented players in their ranks although it will take at least two seasons before they can dream of competing toe-to-toe with the league's top guns. “Our players are still young with very little experience in this kind of championships. This is one of the toughest and competitive challenges that require proper preparations. We want to move out of our comfort zone and work hard to maintain our position in the Kenya Cup, which offers good exposure," he said. The coach hopes that sporting activities will resume soonest to allow players continue earning from playing rugby as well as continually supply the national team with talented players.
