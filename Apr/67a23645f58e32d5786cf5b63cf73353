The Kitui government has partnered with the National Health Insurance Fund to insure 100,000 families in the actualisation of universal health coverage for its people. Governor Charity Ngilu and NHIF chief executive officer Peter Kamunyo announced the partnership on Wednesday after a meeting. The announcement, however, could affect the current Kitui County Health Insurance Cover in which 110 families had initially been listed. This year, only 60 households had renewed their registration to the scheme. Ngilu said in the new health insurance scheme, the county will contribute Sh3,000 yearly for each of the 100,000 households while they will top up Sh3,000 to make the Sh6,000 annual cover. The governor said as opposed to the K-chic arrangement where registered cardholders only enjoyed healthcare services in facilities within Kitui, the NHIF cover allowed those registered for the scheme to get inpatient treatment in public or private facilities across Kenya. She said the 100,000 families that will be covered through the new scheme will add to the 31,000 households already enjoying insurance cover courtesy of President Uhuru Kenyatta. She disclosed that NHIF had received Sh192 million to cover the 31,000 families. Kamunyo welcomed Ngilu’s move to support families that were unable to access healthcare, saying it shows her intention to ensure UHC is actualised. He said NHIF being the vehicle towards UHC, success would be attained if all Kenyans who could afford to pay were enrolled as those who cannot afford are identified and supported. Kamunyo said UHC was likely to succeed in Kitui because there are 190 health facilities across the county that have been accredited by NHIF, including 14 level-4 hospitals. “Our commitment and partnership will ensure the people in Kitui and across the county have access to healthcare without financial hardship,” he said.
