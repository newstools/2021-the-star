The Mombasa Covid-19 positivity rate has been at an average of nine per cent for the past 19 days, a report from the county public health department shows. Facilities in the region are also experiencing high number of Covid-19 patients. The Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital, which has 12 Intensive Care Unit beds for Covid-19 patients, has seven patients admitted. From April 1 to 18, some 7,348 people were tested for coronavirus in the county, out of which 662 turned out to be positive, which is a nine per cent positivity rate. On April 12, the county registered the highest positivity rate of 26.2 per cent after 17 people turned positive from the 65 who went for the test. April 3 recorded the lowest positivity rate of 2.6 per cent after only eight people from a sample group of 313, who were tested for Covid-19 in the region. On the uptake of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the county has so far vaccinated over 16,985 people. Mombasa received its first batch of 9,000 doses on March 9. Two weeks ago, the county received another batch of 9,000 more doses. As of Monday, over 19,934 people had registered for the jab, this therefore means that the county will have to ask for more doses “So far, 16,985 have taken the first jab of Covid-19. Out of this, 9,171 are male, 7,811 are female and three people are intersex,” reads part of the report. Out of the targeted 4,500 health workers in Mombasa, 3,568 have so far been vaccinated. A total of 900 police officers and 2,065 teachers, 50 journalists and other 10,454 people have also been vaccinated. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho was on March 23 forced to take the Covid-19 jab after the frontline workers refused to take the vaccine. However, since Joho took the jab, the numbers have gone up, forcing the county government to open seven places where the vaccines can be administered. Before the governor went for the jab, only 800 of the targeted 4,500 health workers had gone for the vaccine. -Edited by SKanyara
