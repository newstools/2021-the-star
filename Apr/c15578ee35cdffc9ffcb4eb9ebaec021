Kenya Prisons coach Josp Barasa has tipped his charges to fight for a podium finish at the African Club Championship, even in his absentia. Barasa failed to travel with the team to Tunisia as he continues to work with Malkia Strikers, where he is an assistant to Paul Bitok, in a bubble training camp at Moi Stadium, Kasarani ahead of the delayed Tokyo Olympic Games in July. In his place, Prisons' men's coach David Lung'aho will take charge in Tunisia. Barasa oozed with confidence that Lung'aho has the expertise to guide the team to glory. Lung'aho doubles up as the Kenya Volleyball Federation Technical Director. Prisons last won the continental title in 2013. "The team will be without players who are with us at the national team camp but the players who are in Tunisia, not only boast of quality but also have amassed enough experience under their belts to compete at the highest level," Barasa observed. "I expect them to fight for the title and their only stumbling block could be Tunisian Teams. The only challenge could be they have been training outdoor but we have played the game indoor in league matches prior to the league being stopped as a containment measure for the spread of the pandemic." He added: "Lung'aho is an accomplished coach and will craft a winning formula to down their opponents." Egypt's Al Ahly, the most successful club in the history of the competition, with 10 titles, won't grace the tournament setting stage for a new champion. Prisons will miss Joy Luseneka, Lorraine Chebet, Pamela Masaisai and Elizabeth Wanyama. Barasa said winning the first match will inspire confidence in the Prisons' team. "Winning the first match will have a bearing on the subsequent results. If you win the opening game, players will gain confidence and self-belief that they can get the job done in other matches." Prisons will rely on the services of captain Brackcides Agala, Yvonne Wavinya, Shyrine Jepkemboi and Ann Lowem in an 11-member squad.
