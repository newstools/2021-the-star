Three more players have been called up to Kenya Lionesses as the team prepare to start training on Saturday ahead of the FIBA Africa Zone 5 Championships in Cairo, Egypt. The inclusion of Celia Okumu, Barbra Diana (both from KPA) and Valerie Kemunto from Zetech University brings to 25, the number of players in camp. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) secretary, Ambrose Kisoi, said the team will kick-start their training for the July 5-10 continental festival at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium on Saturday. Head coach George Mayienga, who is based in Kampala with JKL Dolphins, will take charge of the team alongside Mike Opel (KPA), Eunice Ouma (Eagle Wings) and Tony Ochieng (Strathmore University). “Mayienga is coming and will meet the players and his three assistants before drawing a training program,”said Kisoi. Kenya will fight it out with debutants South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the host for the sole ticket to the final tournament slated for Cameroon in September. Kenya failed to win a single game and were placed 11 out of 12 teams in their last championships in Dakar, Senegal in 2019. Mayienga, who guided United States International University (USIU)-A to two national women’s titles in 2015 and 2016 remains optimistic he can revive the country’s glory says.
