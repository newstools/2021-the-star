Ugandan comedienne Anne Kansiime says she was scared she was when she first found out she was pregnant with her first child. Kansiime, who recently welcomed her son with artiste Skylanta, said she was afraid of losing the pregnancy hence she didnâ€™t tell her boyfriend when she found out about it. "I was happy but scared. I had lost so much before and finding out I was pregnant, I did not even tell Sky until I went to the hospital and they confirmed I was 6/7 weeks pregnant." Skylanta said, "Anne is not specific about the gender of the baby, she just wanted to have one. I, on the other hand, have been very specific in my prayer, I wanted a little boy and God has done it for us." The couple welcomed their son, Selassie Ataho, last week.
