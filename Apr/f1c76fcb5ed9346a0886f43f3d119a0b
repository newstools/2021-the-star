"We urge well-wishers to help Beatrice breathe with ease through donations towards her medical bill, the Star said in a statement released on Saturday. If you are interested in helping Beatrice, you can send your donations to MPESA Paybill number 922379, under the account name The Star. The Star has also made it clear to the public that all proceeds will be directed entirely to Beatrice Makokha's medical bills. Someone out there can give her a smile back. You can reach out and help through Namalwa Jenty on 0705331763. It all started when Beatrice felt a mild pain on the right side of her head, but brushed it off as a mere headache. That was 21 years ago. Today, the pain has morphed into a serious growth that has covered virtually her face. Her breathing has been severely hampered. Makokha says the niggling pain began back in January 2000. What was a mild pain just above the eye has since worsened and covered even the nostril. The pain grew with each passing day. “It felt like my eye was being stabbed with a knife and I just couldn’t stop rubbing it. The rubbing would slowly get intense and vigorous until my eye turned red," Makokha told the Star during an interview at her home in Stabicha in Kimilili, Bungoma county.
