Justice Marete Njagi has been put to task over claims of being high handed with court staff. An incident where he arrested and punished a court staff for making noise along the court corridors when he was hearing matters.

The chief magistrates had taken steps to fight this menace and it would not go away. So for a long time we had this issue and it was not going to go away. We cannot sustain this.” The judge was also compelled to explain why he used a judgment in his own case against TSC as authority in a different case which involved Maasai Mara university.

He says the commission should go to Chuka at his farm and see how he takes care of his two cows or his coffee farm. That goes to show that he is capable
