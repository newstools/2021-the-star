There was a time students’ representatives in universities were revered. Their mere presence created a certain air of importance. Student grievances were taken seriously and arbitrary decisions were never made. Eventually, their role in campus politics would catapult most of them to the national stage. Of course, this came with its fair share of hooliganism. Quite often, there were strikes, which would disrupt learning as students would be sent home. Then there was the vandalism of property both within the learning institutions and the vicinity. Many motorists have had experiences where their cars were vandalised or even burnt when they were caught up in the melee. The worst cases were where some students lost their lives in the course of running battles with the police. Most institutions revamped their code of elections and created criteria where only students with a good track record could vie for leadership posts. In some institutions, one needs to even get a certificate of good conduct from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, a requirement that previously didn’t exist. The rationale behind this was to have a more ‘civilised’ way of solving disputes through a diplomatic approach. But is the diplomacy working? Perhaps not. Today, college and university administrators often force guidelines down the throats of students. And in cases where student input is needed, the students’ concerns are blatantly disregarded, with the administrators bulldozing their way. Which begs the question, was the previous system better? I definitely do not support the violence and destruction of property it came with, but we must give it due credit for defending students’ welfare. Today, most student leaders are ceremonial representatives, who have lost their mojo. Edited by T Jalio This story first appeared on Sasa Digital, accessible on Sundays by dialling *550*3#
