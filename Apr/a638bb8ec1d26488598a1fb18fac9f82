Vihiga Queens head coach Alex Alumira has exuded confidence ahead of the inaugural Cecafa Women's Champions League tournament, saying he believes he has a strong squad to charge for the title. Alumira said in a telephone interview with the Star on Friday he would only tinker the current playing unit just a little bit in readiness for the 11-team regional showpiece that will be held in Nairobi from July 15 to August 1. After bagging three back-to-back Kenyan Women's Premier League titles, Alumirah is convinced they have what it takes to impress against any of their opponents devoid of pressure, adding they will take any disappointing results as a learning experience. “Being our first-ever international assignment, we are going to learn international trade and we are not going to pile a lot of pressure on our players since it might be counterproductive,” Alumira said. “In this first outing, it is a possibility we can clinch the title in this maiden season but much relies on girl. As of now, ours is to see how far we can go,” he added. Alumira says the tournament will be a perfect platform for him and his charges to showcase their mettle to the rest of the world. “We have been praying for such tournaments to come in order to help me to gauge my skills with other coaches across Africa. It will also help my players showcase their skills as well,” Alumira said. “I will just have them play the way we have been playing. The advantage we have is that more than three-quarters of our players have international exposure and experience,” he added. Alumira has been reluctant to ditch Vihiga Queens saying he still has some unfinished business with the club. “I started with this team from scratch and I am praying to God that I go with this team to international level first and win a title before thinking otherwise,” he said.
