Kenya Prisons stormed the semi-finals of the Africa Club Championships after a beating Wolaita Sodo in straight sets in their final Pool ‘A’ match. To book a date with Carthage of Tunisia, the wardresses beat their Ethiopian opponents 25-4, 25-23, 25-11 in a one-sided encounter. Meanwhile, Kenya Pipeline were relegated to the classification matches after registering a second consecutive defeat, falling in straight sets to CF Carthage. The 25-11, 25-16, 25-20 defeat saw the Kenyans drift off the top two positions, the automatic qualification criteria to the semi-finals. Carthage finished top of Group ‘B’ and qualified for the last four alongside Nigeria Customs. The defeat to Carthage was the second in a row for the oil girls, who fell 3-2 to Customs of Nigeria on Sunday. This was contrasting to how Paul Gitau’s side stormed the competition as they won their three opening matches against Asec Mimosa of Ivory Coast, National Alcohol of Ethiopia and Senegal’s AS Douane. Elsewhere, the 2021 Men’s Club Championship’s organising committee decided to transfer the venue of the competition final, set for Tuesday, to Sidi Bousaid Hall after the spectators invaded Zouaoui Hall during the semi-final match between Tunisian sides Esperance and Kelibia. The match was delayed for 35 minutes as spectators were forced to vacate the hall. The final between Egypt’s Zamalek and hosts Esperance will be played without fans.
