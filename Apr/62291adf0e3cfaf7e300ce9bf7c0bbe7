Police in Bungoma on Wednesday arrested a man found transporting counterfeit cigarettes to Uganda. The 32-year-old driver was arrested by officers in Ndengelwa area along the Webuye-Malaba highway at 4pm after a tip-off from members of the public. Bungoma South deputy police boss Patrick Gogo said the officers flagged down the vehicle but the driver did not stop. They had to shoot the two rear tyres to force the driver to stop. "When our officers checked the vehicle that was heading to Uganda, they found fake cigarettes in 32 cartons estimated at a street price of Sh2 million," Gogo said. He said the man is being detained at Bungoma police station. He will be taken to court. "We want to urge our people to find better things to do other than engage in things that will land them in trouble," he said. Cases of counterfeit goods being smuggled outside and inside the country through the porous borders of Kenya and Uganda have been on the rise in the recent past. Edited by A.N
