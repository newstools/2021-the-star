Nigerian singer-songwriter Tay Iwar has announced his upcoming EP, ‘Love & Isolation’, due for release on April 16. “Peaking” is the first single from the upcoming project. ‘Love and Isolation’ focuses on healing and tapping into the love that is shared and kept between people. Amidst a chaotic and spontaneous world forced into lockdown, the five-track EP features slow-paced R&B songs, connected through beautiful melodies that take you on an escape through an alternate universe. Tay Iwar describes his latest single as “the dramatic end to a consistent journey through love and isolation. It’s the perfect landing spot for the romantically packed EP”. He describes his style of music as Afro-fusion or Neo Afro-pop, which combines various elements, from classic R&B to Afrobeats.
