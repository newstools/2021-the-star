At the same time, Busia County footbLL fraternity is mourning the death of Division Two League referee Douglas Okiru. Kenya Football Referees Association Teso Branch chairman, Abubakar Karani said they received scanty information regarding the death of their colleague on Tuesday. "I had to send two of my members, Josephat Oroni and Jude Ekasiba to Kocholia Mortuary where indeed they confirmed the news of his death," he said. Abubakar said the cruel hand of death has robbed the referees fraternity of a hardworking person whose promotion to Division One was imminent but held up because of the Coronavirus pandemic. FKF Busia Branch chairman Hillary Musundi said the federation is saddened to lose such a promising referee who discharged his duties diligently. Teso North Sub Branch Coordinator Victor Ochakala said Karani was a very focused, sober,  calm gentle and very genuine critical decision maker when officiating matches. " We were expecting him to help get qualified referees for our sub-branch league which is yet to kick off ," Ochakala said.
