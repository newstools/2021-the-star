Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko asked the High Court to transfer his Sh10 million graft case to another magistrate. The case has been proceeding before Anti-corruption magistrate Douglas Ogoti. Sonko says in the course of the hearing, Ogoto exhibited extreme impatience with the defence team. “He would openly side with the prosecution on literally every point and dismiss every defence point and this forced my counsels to withdraw from the court,” he said. Sonko says that Ogoti has allowed the prosecution to say anything and in one scenario, the prosecution has referred to him as a criminal or that he was running away from his crimes. “However, Ogoti did nothing to stop such scenarios. He only said he recorded relevant remarks,” Sonko says in court papers. He says the prosecution took Ogoti's actions as a licence to proceed as though he had already been convicted, rendering the trial a circus. “A perception now exists that Ogoti had a predetermined mind,” he says. Sonko says he has lodged a complaint before the Judicial Service Commission against Ogoti over his handling of the case. The application was filed on March 24 when Sonko was sick. Sonko says the trial magistrate treated him unkindly, ignored his doctor's reports and instructions. The criminal case has been proceeding in-camera with 12 witnesses having testified so far. Justice Daniel Ogembo who handled the matter directed that the application be served upon the Director of Public Prosecutions and a hearing date be fixed at the registry.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
