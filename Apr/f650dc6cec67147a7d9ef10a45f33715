Convicted sex-pests should be castrated to reduce rising cases of sexual and gender violence in Taita Taveta, some women MCAs have said. In a statement on Tuesday, the MCAs said the rampant rapes and murders of women called for tighter measurers to protect women in the society. “If nothing is done to ensure the safety of our fellow women, we shall start castrating the perpetrators. We are tired of losing our mothers and girls, let this incident be the last one,” Nominated MCA Lillian Kidali said during the presser outside the Assembly in Wundanyi. Their uproar comes a day after the body of a woman was found with the head severed and body parts missing in Werugha area. Last week, another woman was gang-raped and killed at her home in Choke, a few kilometres from the area. Kidali said the murders have left women terrified. She said there is a network of sexual predators in the area that needs to be broken. Detectives on Tuesday arrested one suspect in connection with the murder. He was locked up in Wundanyi police station awaiting to be arraigned. The MCAs accused police of laxity in dealing with suspected perpetrators, noting that murder and SGBV cases were happening during curfew hours. In the recent past, residents of Wundanyi have reported cases of increasing insecurity in the area. The suspected gang has also been linked to burglary in Wundanyi town. “There is a gang on the loose that has to be dealt with. We are wondering why such cases are happening at night while the police are supposed to not only ensure our security but also enforce the overnight curfew,” Martha Keino, chairperson of the Gender and Culture Committee said. Keino said two women and girls have been mysteriously killed since January. She said MCAs will rally residents to protest against police laxity in fighting crime. -Edited by SKanyara
