Motorists would have to wait a little longer to use the Likoni road, section between Jogoo road and Lunga Lunga road as construction works continues. This is despite the Kenya Urban Roads Authority having given a completion date of March this year. Earlier this week, Kura hinted that works are almost over on the road that they have been rehabilitating since last year September. “Thank you all for your patience.. Umbali tumetoka (we have come from far)...Likoni Road, the section between Jogoo road and Lunga Lunga road,” read a notice. Last year, Kura awarded the Sh900 million contract to cementers limited to dual the 1.7km section on Likoni road The construction works started from Jogoo road going all the way to House of Manji until Enterprise road leading to Mombasa road. Kura noted that they will set up a non-motorise transport, as well as a pedestrian walkway as part of the construction, works. Since last year, motorists have been using alternative routes to Lunga Lunga road all through to Outering road to access Jogoo or Enterprise roads. Those using Jogoo road can also use the Donholm interchange to join Outering then proceed to Mombasa road or join Lunga Lunga then head to Likoni and join Mombasa road. Motorists can also use Lusaka road just after the Toyota Kenya Junction or Outering road to connect to Jogoo road. Kura director general Silas Kinoti last month had told the Star that the construction works had taken a bit longer due to the involvement of other factors that includes water and electricity. “There are electricity poles that needed to be relocated and this involves Kenya Power. We couldn’t work on some parts of the road until the poles were removed,” he explained. This also applies to the water pipes that Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company needed to also relocate them," Kinoti added. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
