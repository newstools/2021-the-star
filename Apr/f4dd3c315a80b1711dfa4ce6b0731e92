Former Kenya Rugby Sevens coach Benjamin Ayimba requires Sh2 million to offset a hospital bill accrued at a Nairobi hospital where he has been undergoing treatment for cerebral malaria. Ayimba's condition is said to have worsened since he commenced treatment late last year. He is currently admitted at the High Dependency Unit. "The family thought it was not going to be this serious. We didn't want to cause an alarm but where we have reached now, we call upon the rest of the country to come to our help," a close family member said. The family is planning on transferring the veteran coach to Kenyatta National Hospital for specialised treatment but this can only happen when the outstanding medical bill has been settled. Wellwishers can send their contributions through the Paybill number 8021673 under the account name 'Benjamin Otieno Medical'. Before transitioning into coaching, Ayimba had a glittering career at Kenya 15s and 7s international. He skippered Kenya Cup side Impala Saracens to the Enterprise Cup and Kenya Cup after a 26-year drought. As the Sevens' coach, Ayimba's crowning moment was in 2016 when he led the team to their first World Sevens SeriesÂ  title where they beat Fiji 30-7 at the Singapore Sevens. Prior to that, Ayimba had led the national team to the semis of the Dubai Sevens and an appearance in the finals of the Adelaide Sevens, both in 2009. The Maseno School alumnus was early this year retained as the deputy coach of Kenya Harlequins, under head coach Antoine Plasman of Belgium.
