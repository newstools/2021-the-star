The late John DeMathew's first wife Sarafina has celebrated her late husband. Via her Facebook page, Sarafina expressed gratitude for a song titled the late Mugiithi legend dedicated to her. "I will always be grateful, thanks to hubby for this song you dedicated to me, 'Wairimu'. Despite the ups and downs, we are still united as a family and still trying to live the best life that you fought day in day out for us to have," she said. "I pledged to wear your shoes and be supportive, loving and unite the family you left. I celebrate you." John DeMathew died in August 2019 following an accident near Blue Post Hotel on Thika superhighway. He is survived by two wives, Sarafina and Caroline, and their children.
