President Uhuru Kenyatta has approved the prioritisation of vaccination of all teachers, irrespective of their age, Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia has said. Previously, the government had restricted vaccination during the first phase to those above 50 years. Macharia urged all tutors to take advantage of the new directive to get the jab as schools are set to open in May. Speaking on Thursday at the Knec headquarters during release of KCPE exam results, MachariaÂ  announced that at least 15 primary school teachers have died since the Covid-19 pandemic struck the country in March 2020. "We have lost three deputy head teachers and eight head teachers to the pandemic," she said. Macharia said going forward, the commission has come up with measures to protect all teachers from the virus. "First we instructed our medical health insurance provider to cover all teachers against Covid-related ailments which they have since complied with," Macharia said.
