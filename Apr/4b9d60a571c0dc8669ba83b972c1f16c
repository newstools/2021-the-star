What began as a Good Friday celebration for revellers in Kisumu City ended in police cells after scores of those caught in clubs were arrested. The revellers were arrested while imbibing their favourite drinks and partying past curfew hours as directed by President Uhuru Kenyatta in a move aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19. Most clubs in major towns across the Nyanza region such as Bondo, Siaya, Homabay, Oyugis, Kisii and Migori are known to operate past the recommended closing hours with patrons enjoying their drinks behind closed doors. On Friday night, police officers raided popular clubs along Oginga Odinga street and those located along Makasembo, Jomo Kenyatta and Tom Mboya. Those who were arrested included the bar owners. According to Nyanza region police commander Karanja Muiruri a total of 138 revellers were arrested and locked up at the Central police station cells. He did not divulge details of the raid. However, one of the officers who took part in the operation told the Star on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to speak to the press, that the raids began at 9.30 pm on Friday and was led by Kisumu central subcounty Police Commander Joshua Ng'etich. Ng'etich led a contingent of over twenty officers drawn from the Quick Response Team and general duty officers from Kondele and Central police station in the raid targeting clubs operating beyond curfew hours and those violating other Covid-19 containment measures. Those who were arrested in the raid were immediately ferried using six Land Cruiser pick up vans to Central Police Station cells to await arraignment after the long Easter holidays when the court shall open. Karanja said the operation will continue across the region and will target bars, vehicles and churches that contravene Covid-19 protocols.
