Highly-rated Gor Mahia goalkeeper Caleb Omondi is playing the patience game as he awaits an opportunity to get in between the posts for the record league winners. Omondi has been part of the senior Gor squad for two seasons now but he is yet to feature in a competitive match. That has been down to the presence of international Boniface Oluoch and Gad Matthews. “Competition is very high. This is because I am surrounded by experienced goalkeepers and that motivates me to work even harder. It’s also good for the team as it makes every player offer his best to get a chance to play. Competition also gets everyone active and yearning for an opportunity,” Caleb said on the Kogalo official portal. Caleb admitted it’s been a big challenge to convince his family that the sport can work well for him. “The biggest challenges I face in my career is that I grew up in a family that doesn’t understand football and so, it has been tough for me to put up my case or convince them that football can be my main thing.” The tall young keeper, who is yet to make a debut in any league fixture, rates two figures as his role models and aims at helping the team achieve the best even as he learns from first-choice keepers. “My aim in the team is to help the club achieve more in every competition and the day I will be given a chance, I will show my worth. Boniface Oluoch and Jerim Onyango are my role models. I have learnt a lot from them,” concluded the 20-year-old.
