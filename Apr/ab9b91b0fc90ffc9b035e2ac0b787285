 North Eastern regional commissioner Nicodemus Ndalana has urged residents to get vaccinated amidst the third wave of Covid-19 infections. Speaking at his office in Garissa town on Saturday, Ndalana said taking the vaccine and following safety guidelines ‘was the surest way of beating the virus.’ “I want to ask all residents in this region, especially those aged above 58 to come out and take the vaccine. There is nothing to fear because I have already taken mine. This is the way to overcome this deadly virus,” Ndalana said. He asked mosques and churches to ensure they provide water points, conduct temperature checks and ensure their congregations correctly wear their face masks. The administrator cautioned local hotels that they risk being shut down for flouring the protocols. He said some facilities were hosting events such as weddings and allowing more people than is allowed. “We will not wait for our people to die. Those who are holding meetings are required to strictly adhere to the health guidelines. We are also asking the religious leaders even as we approach Ramadhan and Easter holidays to make sure that their celebrations are limited to 60 per cent capacity,” Ndalana said.  Garissa has recorded 860 cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic struck last year with 29 deaths. Health executive Roble Nunow said the county received 6,000 doses of Astra Zeneca vaccine. Some 456 people have so far been vaccinated. Nunow said 22 patients are being observed while five are critical and on oxygen support at the Garissa Referral Hospital. The CEC urged residents to visit health centres whenever they experience Covid-19 related symptoms for testing. He said the health department will be holding talk shows to sensitise communities on the importance of taking the Covid-19 jab. There have been growing fears among residents about the vaccine.
