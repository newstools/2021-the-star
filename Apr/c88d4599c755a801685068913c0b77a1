There will be no licensing of private players in the importation of vaccines, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has said. During a press briefing on Friday at Afya House, the CS made it clear that any such licenses given will be terminated. “There will be no licensing of private players in the importation of vaccines and any such license given will be and is hereby terminated. The only agent for vaccination in Kenya will remain the government of the republic of Kenya until further notice," Kagwe said. He also added that effective April 2, 2021, the government is closing the window of private sector importation, distribution and administration of vaccines. “The government is effective today closing the window of private sector importation, distribution and administration of vaccines until such a time when it is confident that there is greater transparency and accountability in the entire process," he said. On the issue of being charged to get the vaccine, Kagwe said anyone partaking in this exercise, will be liable for prosecution. "Anyone offering COVID-19 vaccine at a fee, is in contravention of Poisons Board regulations and will be liable for prosecution," he warned. On Wednesday, Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said health workers have been warned against charging for the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. "The AstraZeneca vaccine that is available in all public health facilities is there for free, there is no cost to that vaccine. The vaccine is available for free in the facilities and this includes private facilities as well," she said.
