Nothing is scarier to a politician than a corruption case that can be activated or pursued any time by the wielders of power. Politicians shudder at the mere mention of such career-shattering prospects and would gladly do the state’s bidding. They become easily manipulated by the mandarins in exchange for being safe from prosecution, and to save their jobs and skin. This is a time-tested political manouvre state officers use against  those who do not enjoy equal measure of state control to manage politics surrounding their relevance, continuity and succession. Many Kenyans of goodwill have complained that the war on corruption is not only being politicised but weaponised to fight political battles. Institutions tasked with justice, security and integrity are thus under constant attack from the forces that are supposed to lend them support. The Constitution is observed or abrogated at the whim of those who hold power but seek short-term gain. Yesterday’s pariahs are today being courted by those who  couldn’t allow them to move closer to them, thanks to their change of tune and affiliations . “High profile cases” have  gone cold as the state go easy on the alleged culprits. It is on this backdrop that governors who are managers of public funds, most of whom dipped their hands in the county coffers are trooping to the national government side to avoid embarrassment. While, this does not give a true picture of how politics will finally pan out, it gives a clear sense that our politics is devoid of integrity , sense of public duty and honesty if not morality. Left to go on, Kenya will be like a kingdom or a class rule where those without means(power and money) will not have any say in statescraft.  Economic and political analyst
