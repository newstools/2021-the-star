Residents of Nguni area in Mwingi East burnt down a pub after its owner was accused of killing a man and dumping his body on the highway where it was run over by a car on Thursday night. The residents torched the pub shortly after police had left the scene with the body on Friday. They said it was not the first time a person was killed at the drinking joint and the body dragged and dumped on the road to make it appear as if it were an accident. Pedestrians had found the body on the Mwingi – Garissa highway and informed the police. When the police came to collect the body, a trail of blood led them to the pub. The officers documented the scene and moved the body to Mwingi Level 4 hospital mortuary. Mwingi East subcounty police commander Joseph Yakan said three people had been arrested in connection with the murder. Ambrose Safari, a resident, said it was the third time a person had been found dead near the pub under unclear circumstances. In most cases, the body had been run over by a vehicle. “Residents demand the government to take stern action against the perpetrators,” Safari said. David Mwangangi said the pub was notorious for brawls as it attracts lots of customers.  (edited by o. owino)
