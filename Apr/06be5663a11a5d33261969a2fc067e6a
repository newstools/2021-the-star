President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday inspected the expansion of the 84-km Kenol - Sagana - Marua Highway into a four-lane dual carriageway. The new road, which is part of the Trans-Africa Highway (Cairo-Cape Town) will ease congestion along this major transport artery. Transport CS James Macharia, who accompanied the president during the inspection, said that the upgrading of the Kenol - Sagana - Marua road, will enhance linkages between northern and southern Kenya, and boost economic activity between these regions. The Kenol - Sagana - Marua road connects the Nothern Corridor (Mombasa - Malaba) and the LAPSSET Corridor (Lamu - Isiolo - Ethiopia/South Sudan). On December 2020,  the Kenya National Highways Authority chairman Wangai Ndirangu said the 84km Kenol-Sagana-Marua dual carriageway will be ready for use by  December 2021 Construction works started in July and will be done in two phases. The Head of State also visited the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology in Nyeri County to preside over the launch of the Semi-Conductor Technologies factory. The factory, which is the only one of its kind in Africa, is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) between the university and American nanotechnology firm 4Wave Inc. The factory manufactures nanotechnology products such as integrated circuits and sensors used in electronic gadgets for the global market.
