Kenya's  Covid-19 transmission rate in the first three months of the year  inspired confidence at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), pushing investors' paper wealth by Sh100 billion. According to quarter one 2021 Capital Markets Authority (CMA) Statistical Bulletin released Wednesday, the end market capitalisation increased by 4.3 per cent during the period under review to Sh2.437 trillion compared to Sh2.33 trillion in the quarter to December. The investors' wealth grew by over Sh400 billion on year-to-year basis considering that the Nairobi bourse reported a market capitalisation of Sh2.016 trillion in Q1 2020. The country reported a consistent drop in daily new Covid-19 infection cases between January and March, dropping to a positivity rate of less than two per cent, way below a safe net of five per cent as per World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation. Equity turnover during the period under review stood at Sh31.74 billion, compared to Sh27.51 billion registered in Q4.2020; a 15.34 per cent increase, confirming an increase in trading activity at the bourse during the quarter.

CMA chief executive Wyckliffe Shamiah said market performance at NSE has shown considerable improvement on both equities and bonds. ''Generally, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter comparisons of key indicators show growth at the bourse,'' Shamiah said. Even so, the rich NSE 20 index recorded a 1.18 per cent decrease to close the quarter at 1,846.41 compared to 1,868.39 recorded in the previous quarter on the continued exit of foreign investors.

According to CMA, foreigners exit from the market on Covid-19 effect is not a unique situation to Kenya. Most international traders have retreated to stable markets or diversify investments to minimize risks.
