The Kenya Ports Authority has warned of a tropical Cyclone now named "Jobo" which has been noted to be moving in the general direction towards the East African Coastline. This is following the development of low-pressure systems in the South Western Indian. Cyclone Jobo is forecasted to make land fall on Sunday. Mombasa Port and Shipping notice has been issued for the period of April 25th-27th, 2021, during which time the Port and the surrounding regions will experience bad weather in way of heavy rains accompanied by strong winds. The Authority has advised that all ships in the Harbour to look out for this imminent bad weather and take every necessary action to secure vessel against strong winds including doubling of mooring lines where possible. "All ships drifting outside port limits to maintain not less than 15 nautical miles from the nearest point of land and keep crew and engines on standby," KPA said. KPA has also urged the public to beware of dangers associated with strong winds, heavy rains and floods. Mombasa Port Control and Pilots will remain available on VHF Channel 12 and 16 to assist ships where required and where possible while Port Fire Services will remain on standby to respond to landslide emergencies during the notice period. According to BBC, Zanzibar's authorities have halted all sea activities, including fishing and transport, until further notice as a tropical storm approaches the Tanzanian islands. Jobo has been downgraded from a cyclone to a depression but is still forecast to bring heavy rain and strong winds. It is due to hit the coast of Tanzania, including the biggest city, Dar es Salaam, on Sunday. Residents of coastal areas have been warned to avoid all travel and people in low-lying areas have been asked to move to higher ground.
