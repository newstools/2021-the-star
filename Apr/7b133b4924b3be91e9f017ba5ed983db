Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu on Friday appointed the reigning Miss SuperStar Kenya crown holder Nzisa Matulu as the Kitui county brand ambassador. Announcing the appointment in a social media post, the governor said she had had a meeting with the 23-year-old beauty queen in her office. Ngilu said her administration will support Nzisa as she contests the Miss SuperStar World Beauty pageant in Bodrum, Turkey in May. “Nzisa is now an Ambassador for Kitui county and Kenya. We will support her all the way when she contests for Miss SuperStar World Beauty Contest in Bodrum next month as she flies the Kitui and Kenyan flag high at the global stage with pride and confidence,” said Ngilu. The governor described the youthful contestant as an embodiment of beauty with brains and an inspiration to girls across Kenya. She further disclosed that Kitui County Textile Centre will produce the costumes Nzisa will use in Turkey as she seeks the SuperStar world honours. “KICOTEC will design the outfits she will wear at the World beauty pageant on May 24,”  added Ngilu in her post as she congratulated Nzisa and wished her well in the global competition. “Go and conquer. God speed Nzisa,” Ngilu said.  Nzisa is a finance and accounting graduate from Mount Kenya University. The governor called on all women leaders in Ukambani and Kenya at large to support Nzisa as she represents the country at the global stage. -Edited by Sarah Kanyara
