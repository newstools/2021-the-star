Simba have initiated talks with former Kenyan International Patrick Matasi over a possible move to 'Wekundu wa Simbazi'. This comes amidst heightened speculations that Simba's first-choice custodian Aisha Manula could well be on his way to South Africa, where he has attracted interest from Mamelodi Sundowns. “Things could happen anytime soon and we have already confirmed there are negotiations going on between Matasi and Simba,” wrote Tanzania's sports magazine Mwanaspoti. “The news we have is that Mamelodi have already made a bid for Manula and Simba's management have agreed to talks,” wrote the publication. “Mamelodi are keen on signing Manula because their dependable goalkeeper Ugandan Dennis Onyango has indicated he wants to retire and that he won't consider penning a new deal with them,” it added. Mamelodi are viewing Manula as Onyango's perfect replacement after his recent exceptional exploits between the sticks propelled Simba to a top finish in their group in the Caf Champions League, ahead of defending champions Al Ahly. Simba insiders say the management is planning to demand a big sum for Manula who has only a year left on his contract. Simba players have been basking in their post-Champions League glory and a few of them have attracted deals from outside. Subsequently, the side is keen on capitalising on the windfall to beef up their fortunes. Besides Manula, Mozambican Luis Jose is also said to be on the radar of a Moroccan side.
