The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and DCI detectives should investigate the tendering process in Vihiga, Senator George Khaniri has said. “We want to know whether those tenders are issued as required by law or people are being awarded because they have an inside link,” Khaniri told the Star by phone. The senator's statement comes a few days after a wall collapsed at a construction site in Vihiga killing one and injuring others. Governor Ottichilo said he had a meeting with National Construction Authority officials after visiting the site. “We want them to speed up the investigation so that we implement the report before proceeding with the construction,” he said. Executive director Maurice Aketch told journalists a probe on the wall collapse was ongoing. “We are going to work as a team to protect the interest of the public and we shall do a detailed investigation to have a clear report before the project continues,” Aketch said.
