Kenya will need to have a solid training camp for Morans to make an impact at the FIBA AfroBasket Championship in Kigali, Rwanda according to Denmark-based Preston Bungei. The playmaker, who controlled Kenya’s offence in their historic 74-73 victory over Angola in the AfroBasket qualifiers in Cameroon in February, said success will come if the team continues to build on their chemistry. Bungei, who plays for Randers Cimbri, observed that they will be among the best if they do a lot of work on executing successful offensive display coupled with arresting their defensive weaknesses. He said reviewing films of their past performances will be crucial in understanding their weaknesses and strengths and thus know which to work on more going forward. “Kenya will surprise a lot of teams in the championships if they continue to build on the team chemistry and work on executing offence and defence,” said Bungei. Bungei, who logged 35 minutes and registered 10 points was instrumental in the victory over the 11-time champions that returned Morans to the African show for the first time in 28 years. “For the team to succeed, Morans will have to go back and watch films from their previous games and look at the things that hurt them,” he observed. But while the foreign-based players are seeing activities in their respective leagues, their Kenyan-based compatriots are having it rough following the indefinite suspension of sport and thus the various Kenya Basketball Federation leagues. Morans are expected to go to camp in June at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani in preparation for the continental championships.
