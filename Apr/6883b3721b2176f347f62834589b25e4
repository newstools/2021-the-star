An infuriated motorist believed to have stabbed a boda boda rider to death in Meru county is now behind bars. It emerged that Ian Mwenda, 25, was riding from Maua towards Antubochiu Market on Monday evening when strong winds blew off his cap. He turned back to pick up his cap unaware that death was lurking in the shadows. George Miriti, who was driving behind the rider in a navy blue Probox Succeed, is reported to have been enraged when Mwenda stopped his motorcycle on the road and bent to pick his cap. A witness told officers from Maua police station that Miriti stopped his vehicle and angrily charged at the rider, demanding to know why he had stopped on the road. DCI boss George Kinoti said he mocked the rider but to avoid a confrontation, Mwenda drove off toward lower Antubochiu Market. But an angry Miriti followed him at high speed and overtook him a few metres ahead. He blocked the rider, came out of his vehicle armed with a knife and suddenly stabbed him. "The knife tore through Mwendaâ€™s chest from the front left side. He dropped dead on the road," Kinoti said. He was rushed to Maua Methodist Hospital but died on arrival. Officers from Maua police station immediately launched a manhunt for the assailant and arrested him at Mutuati area. Police seized his vehicle, whose windscreen had been smashed, and recovered blood-stained clothes. The exhibits have been preserved for further forensic examination. As the suspect awaits arraignment for murder, the search for the murder weapon continues.
