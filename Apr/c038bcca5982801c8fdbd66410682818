Keroche heiress Anerlisa Muigai has hinted that the divorce process to her Tanzanian husband Ben Pol is done. In an Instagram story, Anerlisa said what was needed to be done was done and the divorce papers have been signed. She wrote, "I would like to make it clear that I signed whatever needed to be signed and I do not wish to be associated with anyone. My focus right now is my career and peace." She then signed the message with the initials AM. She has since dropped Ben Pol’s official name 'Mnyang’anga' from her social media platforms, where she used to identify herself as 'Anerlisa Muigai Mnyang’anga', and no longer wears her wedding ring. Earlier this month, Tanzanian blogger Millard Ayo reported that Ben Pol had allegedly filed for divorce at a Tanzanian court against Anerlisa Muigai. It is not yet clear why they are divorcing.
