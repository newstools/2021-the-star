An activist who was arrested over the wide circulation of a poster critical of President Uhuru Kenyatta with his photo attached has been released on a cash bail of Sh500,000 pending completion of investigations. Police had sought 14 days to continue detaining Mutemi Kiama in order to conclude investigations. But Milimani senior Resident magistrate Jane Kamau on Thursday declined to grant the prosecution's application, saying no compelling reasons have been tabled before court to warrant such detention. "Prosecution has failed to show that Kiama should be physically present during investigations," said the magistrate. She ordered Kiama to deposit in court Sh500,000 and report to the investigating officer daily for 10 days. She further directed the case to be mentioned on April 17 for further orders. In an affidavit filed before court, officer Patrick Kibowen said he is investigating a case of suspected contravention of several provisions of the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act. He said it also includes false publication contrary to section 22(1) as read with section 22(2) (b) thereof. Police say the suspected offences allegedly occurred on different occasions between April 5 and 6, 2021 by way of publication on social media. “The preliminary investigations have disclosed that the Twitter handles “Mwarimu Mutemi wa Kiama” @MutemiWaKiamu and “Wanjiku Revolution" @WanjikuRevolt on which the suspected criminal publication was made is linked to Kiama,” the affidavit reads. Kiama is accused of publishing on social media, a photo of the President with his ID number alongside a notice to the world that he is "not authorised to transact on behalf of the citizens and that the nation and future generations shall not be held liable for any penalties of bad loans negotiated and /or borrowed by him”. Kibowen added that the words amount to false publication contrary to the law.
