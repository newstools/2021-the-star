Land transactions in Nairobi have gone digital following the launch of an online platform. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday said the platform will curb the ills associated with the land sector. "The system will ensure that investors and those dealing with land are not confronted with warning signs such as plot not for sale, danger, trespassers will be prosecuted. The system will resolve the land problem as it will provide an updated, verified database of land records that are easily available," Uhuru said. The new system dubbed 'Ardhisasa', is a digital land resource management platform designed to enhance the security of land records, speed up land transactions, and curb fraud. Ardhisasa was developed locally by a team of young Kenyan techies over a three-year period in a multi-agency government arrangement championed by the president. Uhuru added that the platform will enhance ease of doing business by shortening the period of processing various applications, whether for planning, development control, transfer of ownership, or as collateral for credit from financial institutions.
