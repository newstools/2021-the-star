Uefa have appointed an Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector to conduct an investigation on AC Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic for having an “alleged financial interest in a betting company”, European football governing body said on Monday. Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported earlier this month that Ibrahimovic, 39, is a part-owner of betting company Bethard who he teamed up with in 2018. Fifa’s Code of Ethics state a player cannot have interests in entities or companies that “promote, broker, arrange or conduct betting, gambling, lotteries or similar events or transactions connected with football matches and competitions”. Ibrahimovic had quit international football after the 2016 European Championship but returned to Sweden’s national team for their World Cup qualifiers last month while he also played in Uefa’s Europa League for AC Milan this season. If found guilty, Ibrahimovic would have to pay a fine of $109,373 and would be banned from any football related activity for a maximum of three years. Last week Ibrahimovic signed a one-year contract extension that will keep him at AC Milan beyond his 40th birthday. Meanwhile, Ibrahimovic and Inter Milan’s Romelu Lukaku have been fined for unsportsmanlike conduct following an investigation into a verbal clash between the pair during a Coppa Italia match in January. The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) said on Monday that Ibrahimovic had been fined 4,000 euros, Lukaku 3,000 euros, AC Milan 2,000 euros and Inter 1,250 euros. The two former Manchester United team mates exchanged insults during the cup quarter-final on January 26 and Lukaku had to be restrained at the end of the first half after being left incensed by Ibrahimovic’s comments. Both players were fined for “unsportsmanlike behaviour with provocative phrases”, while the clubs were punished due to their responsibility for the conduct of their players.
