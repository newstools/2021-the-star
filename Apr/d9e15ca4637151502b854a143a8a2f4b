A driver died on the spot and his four passengers were seriously injured when his vehicle rolled several times on the Mai Mahiu-Narok Road. The driver apparently lost control of his Toyota Platz in the notoriously dangerous Pinyinyi Hills area on Monday evening. Narok East police commander Muthamia Mwenda said the driver was coming from the Mai Mahiu side and was descending the Pinyinyi Hills when he lost control. He said the driver died instantly. Mwenda said the four passengers, three men and one woman, are hospitalised in stable condition at Narok Referral Hospital. The driver’s body was moved to Narok Referral Hospital mortuary for a postmortem exam. The vehicle was extensively damaged and towed to Ntulele police station for inspection. In August 2013, 42 passengers headed to Western Kenya died when their bus crashed in the Pinyinyi Hills. The National Transport and Safety Authority implemented many changes in the transport sector to reduce accidents. But statistics remain high, including in the Pinyinyi Hills. Changes included requiring speed governors on PSVs and banning night travel until transport companies met regulations.  (Edited by V. Graham)
