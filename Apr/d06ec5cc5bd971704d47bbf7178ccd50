Nigerian rapper Kida Kudz has dropped his first solo, 'Animalistic'. Speaking on the release, Kida said writing the song was a spiritual process for him. "I woke up early one morning, grabbed my pen and paper and started jotting down to the instrumental and tapped into the forces I needed; the lyrics just flowed from me," he said. "I was painting a perfect picture of an African boy speaking to his people, trying to preach to them in a kind of way." Kida wrote the song on the day he lost a family member. The song explores the topic of incarceration and the discomfort and cultural issues around it. Kida adds on how personal it goes. "You can vibe to the song but at the same time, it is sending a message across to young people to stay up and stay woke."
