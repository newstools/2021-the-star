While releasing the results on Thursday, Education CS George Magoha lauded performance by public primary schools for weathering all the challenges to post impeccable results. Magoha acknowledged the improved performance of public schools, despite their high enrolment numbers and inadequate teaching and learning resources. â€œIn particular, I am impressed that public schools have shone in the 2020 KCPE, scooping 10 of the top 15 overall slots in the examination. Additionally, of the top 15 places," Magoha said. There were fears that the long break due to the coronavirus pandemic would impact negatively the overall performance of public schools. Schools were closed between March and early October in 2020. While private schools had invested heavily in digital learning for the six months, public schools remained closed due to the surge in the Covid-19 cases. In the 2019 results, the best candidate was Andy Michael Munyiri of Damacrest Schools, a private institution in Thogoto, Kikuyu, Kiambu county, who obtained 440 marks  (edited by o. owino)
