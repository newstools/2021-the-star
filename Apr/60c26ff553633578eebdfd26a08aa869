Nairobi Regional Commissioner James Kianda has asked Kenyans to plan their movements to avoid being caught violating curfew. Nairobi motorists were on Saturday night stranded as police blocked major roads over curfew time. The motorists were stuck on roads along Thika road for hours with some blaring their horns and insulting authorities over the roadblocks. In Nairobi and other infected zones, the curfew time is 8pm. By this time, many Nairobians were still on the road. Demonstrating how frustrated they were over the roadblocks, the motorists were seen shouting while others were busy taking pictures and protesting on Twitter. But the government has defended its move saying that all Kenyans must follow the measures. In a statement on Sunday, Kianda said Kenyans are aware of the construction works on major roads within the metropolis and should therefore make prior plans to see themselves indoors before curfew hours. "We are also fully alive to the fact that there are and we urge wananchi to plan their movements accordingly with a view to beating the curfew hours. If we all step up voluntary compliance with these measures, then we have a chance to reach the globally recommended five per cent positivity rate, and the total reopening of our economy and country shall come sooner that we projected," Kianda said. "We wish to remind Kenyans that each life matters, and we must all take part in breaking the chain of transmission of the virus. However stringent these rules may appear, they are imperative for our survival. As such, civic responsibility is a more potent weapon in this war than enforcement of the guidelines by the police."
