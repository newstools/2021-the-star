A Kibera court has directed that a politician's daughter and a businessman linked to a sex trafficking and rape case stay in custody until the victim testifies. Senior principal magistrate Esther Boke on Friday ruled that that the two suspects Abdirizak Adan Abdullahi and Faith Bwibo stay in custody. While delivering the ruling,  Boke said the victim's safety is important during the hearing of the matter. She further noted that the two might interfere with witness hence a conclusive decision will be made once key witnesses have testified. The suspects through their lawyer King’ori  urged the court to supply them  with documents that prosecution will rely on during the trial. King'ori further pleaded with the court that his clients' mobile phones be returned. Court prosecutor Allan Mogere told the court detectives were still investigating the suspects' phones. The charge sheet says that Bwibo unlawfully and knowingly transported a woman only identified as FJK, for sexual exploitation by means of deception. Bwibo was charged alongside Abdirizak Adan Abdul who is accused of rape. On the same day, the charge sheet says that  within South C, he raped the complainant. Abdul had an alternate charge of committing an indecent act with an adult by touching the complainant’s breasts. In the second count of malicious damage to property, the accused is said to have damaged the complainant's mobile phone - an iPhone 8 valued at Sh40,000. The magistrate directed that the matter be mentioned on April 20 for further directions. Boke also directed that the ruling be typed and be given to the accused persons at their own cost.
