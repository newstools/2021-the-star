Former Commonwealth Youth Games 3,000m champion Gladys Chesir is angling for a quick return to winning ways at the Hamburg Marathon following her return from maternity leave. The race was initially set for April 11, before being pushed for a week to April 18 but this has not in any way affected Chesir's ambitions. The former Africa Youth 3,000m silver medalist said: “The rescheduling will not affect my training because, as an athlete, I have to be ready for any eventuality.” This will be Chesir's career marathon after making her debut at the 2017 Amsterdam marathon, where she finished second in a personal best time of 2:24:51. She also competed at the 2018 Boston marathon due to cold weather that affected many athletes. “My preparations have been good throughout despite the biting effects of the coronavirus restrictions. My last race was in Boston in 2018, where I dropped off due to bad weather. With this long time without competition, I can only hope for great results,” added Chesir. Chesir won the Youth Olympic Games 3,000 title in 2010 in Bishan, Singapore before clinching a silver medal at the 2015 All Africa Games. She competed at the 2016 World Half Marathon in Cardiff where she finished 6th. “I have competed in so many half marathons but I want to make a name in the marathon this time round,” added Chesir. Chesir will face the likes of compatriot Selly Chepyego and the Ethiopian trio of Yazemzerf Yehualaw, Zeineba Yimer and Ashete Bekere.
