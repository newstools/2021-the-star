US-based Kenyan artiste Audrey Hinya has released 'More Than Friends', an R&B single that captures the raw emotion and tug of war before lovers come clean about their feelings for each other. Audrey said 'More than Friends' is about that time during a boyfriend-girlfriend stage when you’re still crushing on each other but are both too shy to make a move. The release is the culmination of Audrey’s childhood efforts and dreams to make it as a recording artiste. Audrey is signed under King Kanja’s label, King Kanja Empire. “When I heard her sing, her abilities at such a young age blew my mind instantly,” Kanja said. Audrey described working alongside King Kanja as an amazing opportunity that will equip her with the necessary music skills for her stardom.
