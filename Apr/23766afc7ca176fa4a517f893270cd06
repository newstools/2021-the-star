Singer Sanaipei Tande says she quit drinking in 2019 and that changed her life completely. Speaking in an Instagram Live interview, the ‘Simama Imara’ hitmaker said after that major decision, she felt like she should have done it like 10 years ago. "I think one of the major changes I made and everything changed with that one decision is that in 2019, I made a conscious decision to stop taking alcohol, and so a lot changed with that one decision," she said. "I felt that I was treated in all my 36 years. I was like, why didn’t I stop like 10 years ago? But you know, everything happens at the time it is supposed to happen. You have those experiences so they can better inform your future."
