Twitter went down on Saturday for some Kenyans and Friday for other global users. Thousands of people reported problems viewing and sending tweets on the social network site. During the disruption, Twitter profiles and fleets were still accessible in the app. Posts cached in the app were visible but users could not like, retweet or comment on them. As a user, when you tried retweeting a post, an error message cropped up. “Something went wrong. Try again.” this was witnessed as many people tried to use the platform. Another error message read, “Tweets aren’t loading right now.” Twitter notified the users of the technical hitch. "Tweets may not be loading for some of you. We’re working on fixing a problem and you’ll be back on the timeline soon," they said. Last year, the company was hit by a similar outage due to an internal system change for more than an hour, affecting nearly 70,000 people globally according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. Twitter's shares were down nearly 1% at $39.80 in trading before the bell.
