The joint Justice and Legal Affairs Committees have announced a five-day extension to finalise the BBI report. The members of joint team led by joint chair Kigano Muturi (Kangemi) said they have resolved to give the experts working on the report five more days beginningÂ  April 19 to wrap up the much awaited report. Kigano speaking at Parliament buildings on Thursday said the final report will be tabled in May when the two Houses resume sittings from the month long Covid necessitated break. "The consultants who are working with us are on course and given that we do not have specific deadline other than the return date of Parliament after Covid adjournment where we are expected to table the report. I am happy to report we are on course and because of the Covid interruption we have given the exercise a full five days from April 19 to be able to wrap up and give a report that can withstand the test of time," Kigano said. "We have consulted both the speakers and they have assured that there will be no special sitting for BBI." The Kigumo MP said the Committee has made tremendous progress and will table a comprehensive report next month ."Observations we will be making are important for everybody who is interested in developing their own jurisprudence on article 257."
