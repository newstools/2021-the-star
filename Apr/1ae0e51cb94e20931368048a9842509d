Vanessa Mdee has been supporting her fianc√©, Hollywood actress and singer Rotimi. The excited Tanzanian singer revealed how proud she was of her man for featuring in a new BET movie. "I am so proud of my baby, his movie 'Favorite Son' comes out in May. Please check it out. He gets to be all of this and more." The movie is about two brothers in a musical group who strive for fame and success. This comes months after Rotimi featured in a comedy film, 'Coming 2 America'. The two got engaged last year and are set for a white wedding. While supporting his career, Mdee announced last year she had quit music as it had driven her into alcoholism and depression.
