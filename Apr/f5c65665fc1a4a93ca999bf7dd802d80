A police corporal, a KDF corporal and a prison warder have been nabbed for illegally arresting a boda boda rider in Nairobi's CBD and demanding a bribe. The arrest on Wednesday night was dramatic and violent. Witnesses said the gang of three flagged down a rider on City Hall Way, took his bike and demanded Sh4,000 to release it. As they harassed the rider, an onlooker called police on patrol from Central police station. Two officers responded swiftly but were attacked with kicks and blows from the law enforcers-turned criminals. They were subdued and arrested by police and the public. Handcuffs were recovered from the fake police. The soldier was handed over to the Military Police. The two police officers sustained serious injuries. The three arrested were identified as police corporal Cliff Ombati from Nairobi, KDF lance corporal Ben Shiundu from Mariakani Barracks in Kilifi and warder Eugene Shivach from Wajir GK Prison. The police officer and warder are expected to face charges of impersonation, demanding by menace, being in possession of government stores, assault and resisting arrest, among others. The three had apparently formed a 'multi-agency team' operating in the CBD, holding people, especially boda boda riders, on trumped-up charges and extorting them. Nairobi police boss Augustine Nthumbi said they will investigate to establish if the three had been involved in any other crimes. Cases of impersonation of security officers have been on the rise in the capital in recent months. Cases of demanding by menace are also on the rise; many are committed by police officers.
