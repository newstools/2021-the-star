An investigating officer was on Monday assaulted by a suspect at the Kibera law courts. The suspect pushed the officer to the ground as he tried to handcuff him and the officer started bleeding in his face. “He was trying to handcuff him when he left the court room and from nowhere the suspect head-butted him, he sustained serious injuries and we managed to help him out,” one of the officer told the Star. The officer was taken to a clinic where he was treated and returned to his duties. After he was taken to the police vehicle the suspect boasted about how he could beat officers. “Si mnitoe pingu muone (try taking off these handcuffs and you'll see), I can beat you,” he shouted. The assaulted officer  said the suspect may be abusing drugs. The suspect was in court over robbery with violence. He was taken into remand.
