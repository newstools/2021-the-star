The office of the Ombudsman has ordered the Taita Taveta assembly to publish on its website all records of their business. The Commission on Administrative Justice said the assembly was not compliant with with the Access to Information Act. “The commission notes that the Assembly has not complied with the obligation of proactive disclosure of information relating to its records,” a letter to assembly clerk Gadiel Maghanga reads in part. The letter was signed by the Ombudsman’s access to information Commissioner Lucy Ndung’u. The commission said publication of the records will to allow citizens to be better informed on the work of the assembly and enable them to participate in the development agenda of the county. Further, the clerk has been asked to report to the commission on measures taken by the county government to ensure compliance with section 5 of the Access to Information Act. Public policy expert and community leader Stephen Mwakesi had written to the Ombudsman on March 31 asking for help to access the assembly's records. “We will remain vigilant to ensure that the citizens of Taita-Taveta are empowered with information to enable them to hold their elected leaders to account and reap from the fruits of devolution,” Mwakesi told the Star. He said failure by the assembly to update the website had left many residents unaware of the progress of the county activities, thus were unable to hold elected leaders accountable. Mwakesi said there is a need for residents to be sensitised on following the assembly’s record of business as part of their right to access to information. -Edited by SKanyara
