Only 10 per cent of released Huduma Namba cards have been collected, government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna has said. Oguna said out of about two million released cards, only 200,000 have been collected since the roll out of mass distribution on February 2. According to him, most Kenyans delay in choosing the location where the card should be sent despite getting messages on their mobile phones. "The options are actually in a link. You click the link and you will be given options. So you choose an area that is convenient to you," Oguna said. He spoke on Thursday during a press briefing in Nairobi. Oguna said Kenyans have three days to respond to messages calling them to collect their cards after which the message link will disappear. "When the message disappears and your card is ready, we go back to records, find out where you registered and send the card to a bureau near where you registered," he said. Oguna said the second phase of the Huduma Namba registration will start in early May. He said going forward, the process will continue just like the Identity Card process. Oguna said in the first phase, 37 million people were registered of whom 20 million were adults and 17 million below the age of 18 years.
