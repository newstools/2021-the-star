Former junior international Elijah Matayo is targeting a medal at the  World Relays this weekend in Silesia, Poland. Matayo will represent Kenya in the 4x200m alongside Dan Kiviasi, Mike Mokamba, Hesbon Ochieng and Mark Otieno. Matayo said he expects a podium finish for his team considering their preparations. “I’m saddened by the withdrawal of US and Jamaica. Sometimes it’s good to run with the best athletes in the World,” said the KDF sprinter. The US and Jamaica who have dominated the World Relays for four years withdrew from the event due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Canada also announced their withdrawal from the event. Matayo, however, said despite the withdrawals he expects a highly competitive event. “We have had very good training at our bubble camp in Kasarani and I want to thank the technical team and AK for the support. "The team is buoyant and we are looking forward to a great performance. "This is a good opportunity for me to get my maiden seniors international medal,” added Matayo, who first represented Kenya at the World Under-18 Championships in Nairobi. He also added that he hopes to qualify to the Tokyo Olympics. “Representing my country at the Olympics has always been my dream and  I hope to achieve this in July,” he noted. Matayo, who is a product of Athletics Kenya’s youth training camp at Mogonga PAG Secondary school, will be in Poland with former school-mates Vanice Kerubo Nyagisera and Mary Moraa. Moraa will represent the country in the 4x400m relay while Nyagisera will take part in the shuttle hurdles relay.
