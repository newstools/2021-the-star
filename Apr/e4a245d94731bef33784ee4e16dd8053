With the National Super League season in limbo following the government's decision to suspend all sporting activities in the country, Murang'a Seal will use the opportunity to regroup to save their season. Coach David Mahira, believes his struggling charges can claw their way out of the relegation mire if they can get their act together in the remaining part of the season. Nearly halfway into the campaign, Seal find themselves second from bottom with 16 points from as many games. "We are obviously disappointed that football has been suspended. This, however, could be a blessing in disguise for us to regroup and get away from the position we are in," said Mahira. "We would have loved to try and extricate ourselves from our current situation but the health of our players,fans and other Kenyans take precedent over anything else." Seal have endured tough times since they clinched a historic place in the second-tier league. Most of their key players have left to seek greener pastures elsewhere with the club now relying mostly on local talent from Murang'a County. "We have limited resources to keep top talent in the team. We have to find other ways to cope while remaining competitive and using local talent was our only option," Mahira explained. Talanta lead the NSL standings with 32 points same as fast-improving Police FC.
