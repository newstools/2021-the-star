The government has mobilised chiefs and their assistants to track down people who have not collected their Huduma cards. Central regional commissioner Wilfred Nyagwanga said assistant chiefs will collect the cards at the civil registration offices, trace the owners and deliver the cards to them. Out of 350,000 cards, only 60,000 have been collected. Nyagwanga urged residents who applied for the cards to visit their assistant chiefs or registrar of persons offices to collect them. He told the media on Wednesday that they have been unable to reach some people after they changed their phone numbers. Most of them, Nyagwanga said, could be youth who applied for loans during the Covid-19 pandemic and then got new lines. He urged those who may have changed their phone numbers to visit the offices with their identity cards and get their Huduma cards. “Even if you had applied for the loans, we do not care about that. What we are after is to get you, hand over your card to you and that is all,” the officer said. Nyagwanga said those who lost their identity cards should get police abstracts. He said they aim to have distributed the cards by Monday or Sunday as they wait for the next batch. “We are going to be working even during weekends from now onwards to ensure that the cards get to the owners,” he said.
