Malkia Strikers coach Paul Bitok believes the prospect of the national team training under Brazilian coaches will equip the players with new skills and further boost the morale of the playing unit. The national team is in a bubble training camp at Moi Stadium, Kasarani ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games, and received a major boost as experienced and decorated setter Jane Wacu reported to camp early in the week. The four experienced high-performance coaches arrived today and will be in Kenya for a 10-day scouting visit to assess Malkia after which they will travel back to Brazil, where they will receive the Kenyan team for a month of high-performance training bubble camp. Bitok said their proven track record is further proof that they can take the game to the next level. "The quartet is high-performance coaches who will bring many changes and expertise aimed at improving the team. Remember Brazil have won more volleyball titles than any other nation in the world. They also coach top Brazilian teams and that shows you how important they will be to the team," Bitok noted. He added, "They will definitely push the players to a different level in training in a bid to motivate the playing unit. Ours is to cooperate with them so that by the time we go for the Olympics, we can win some matches," hinted Bitok. Malkia Strikers are set for month-long training in Brazil in May with FIVB meeting all the expenses. Brazil have constantly produced world-beaters, in both the men and women categories. Apart from the camp in Brazil, Malkia will also have another 10-day training camp in Kurume City, Japan, ahead of the Olympics, where they have lined up two friendly matches with local clubs.
