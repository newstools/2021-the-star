Kenya Airways will suspend its passenger flights to the United Kingdom effective on Friday, April 9, 2021. According to the announcement made on Monday, the suspension will remain in place until further notice. This comes following the move by the UK to prohibit Kenyan visitors from landing into its territory over the surging cases of coronavirus infections. “The suspension is due to the directive issued by the government of Kenya suspending all the flights from the UK effective midnight April 9, 2021,” KQ management said. The British High Commission had informed Kenya of plans to add Kenya to its Covid-19- related quarantine list. The decision was sealed by the UK Ministers on March 31 following a review of the latest scientific evidence pertaining to the risk of community transmission of Covid- 19 variants. Retaliating to the UK’s action, the Kenyan government banned all the flights from the UK from landing on its soil. The KQ management said that customers affected by the directive may change their booking for later travel or request a refund with all penalties waived. Following the high demand for travel to the UK before the advisory takes effect, the national carrier has added two more flights on Wednesday and Thursday. Travelers from all countries are required to take Covid-19 tests on Days 2 and 8 following their arrival in the UK. Of the average of 550 people that travel from Kenya to the UK each week, a significant number are testing positive on Day 2.
