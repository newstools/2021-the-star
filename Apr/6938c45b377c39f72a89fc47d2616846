Meru judge Patrick Otieno has recused himself from acting CJ Philomena Mwilu's case. Otieno was the one who issued orders barring Mwilu from office but he later set them aside. Otieno recused himself on Wednesday after Mwilu's lawyers alleged that he had mismanaged the case. Mwilu is represented by lawyers Julie Soweto, LSK President Nelson Havi among others. The judge referred the matter to the presiding judge at Meru High Court to assign it to a another court. The petitioner, Mwongela Mbiti, who has sued Mwilu in the case, accuses Mwilu of manipulating the case by choosing the forum where her case will be heard. Speaking to the Star, Mwongela said Mwilu was the one manipulating the case. "Considering the heat this case has generated, the interests and stakes involved, I feel that the DCJ is out to manipulate the case by choosing the forum where her case will be heard just because she can," Mwongela says. He also claims Mwilu's legal team threatened to file a complaint against the JSC where Mwilu is a member. In the case, Mwongela says Mwilu is unfit to serve in office due to alleged gross misconduct.
