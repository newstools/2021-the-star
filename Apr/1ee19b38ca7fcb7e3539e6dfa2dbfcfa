With the National Super League season in limbo following the government’s decision to suspend all sporting activities in the country, struggling Murang’a Seal coach David Mahira is hopeful his side can take the break to regroup and claw their way out of the relegation mire. With nearly halfway into the campaign, Seal find themselves second from bottom with 16 points from as many games. “We are obviously disappointed that football has been suspended. This, however, could be a blessing in disguise for us to regroup and get away from our current position. We would have loved to try and extricate ourselves from our current situation but the health of our players, fans and other Kenyans take precedent over anything else,” Mahira said. Seal have endured tough times since they clinched a historic place in the second league tier. Most of their key players have left to seek greener pastures elsewhere with the club now relying mostly on local talent from Murang’a county. “We have limited resources to keep top talent in the team. We have to find other ways to cope while remaining competitive and using local talent was our only option,” Mahira explained. Talanta lead the NSL standings with 32points same as fast improving Police FC. Vihiga Bullets are also close by.
