DCI detectives from Ugunja are investigating a defilement report made against a police officer based at Sigomre police station. The officer is alleged to have defiled a 16-year-old girl on Sunday after luring her into his rented house in the area. Detectives led by Ugunja DCIO Andrew Ochengo on Monday recorded statements from the Form 1 student and her mother. A witness who saw the girl enter the officer's house at 4pm also recorded a statement. "I had been told before by neighbours that the policeman was having an affair with my daughter, but I had no way of confirming these claims," the mother said. She said at 4pm, she received a text message from a neighbour notifying her that her daughter had been spotted entering the officer's house. "I rushed there to confirm. I knocked on the door and the officer came out and pushed me away after he realised it was me," she said. The girl fled, leaving behind her shoes and an umbrella. It was raining. Her mother raised the alarm and the officer also took off. She said she reached out to the area chief who advised her to report the matter to Ugunja subcounty police commander. "I got the OCS Ugunja and the DCIO. They took me back to Sigomre where the report was booked," she said. The defilement report was filed under OB number 22/18/04/2021 at 7.45pm. The report indicates that a team including acting OCPD Ugunja, DCIO Ugunja and OCS Sigomre visited the scene. Nyanza regional police commander Karanja Muiruri said he was aware of the incident but hadÂ yet to get the details. "Let me talk to the officers handling the issue so that I can provide the details. However, I can assure you that nobody will be shielded if found culpable," he said. Sunday's incident comes days after the Independent Policing Oversight Authority began investigating a rape incident reported at Sega police station a week ago. Edited by A.N
