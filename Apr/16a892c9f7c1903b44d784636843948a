Ailing Sofapaka midfielder Wisdom Naya is heaving a sigh of relief for the first time in months after club partners Betika agreed to meet the full cost of his treatment. Naya was recently diagnosed with a cancerous, soft tissue sarcoma that requires urgent medical attention. Club president Elly Kalekwa confirmed on Thursday the online gaming firm had actually released Sh300,000, describing their act as a noble gesture. “It's quite impressive that only a day after sharing Naya's condition with Betika, they have come out to help. “As a club, we are overwhelmed by the selfless gesture displayed by our partners and we wish Naya quick recovery. “My special thanks to Kenyans for the their unbelievable support and I wish to encourage them to maintain the spirit,” said Kalekwa. Naya, who is expected to embark on chemotherapy sessions next week, said he was short of words. “I’m extremely elated this morning beyond words. I honestly didn't see this coming. “I sincerely thank Betika and Sofapaka for their selfless support. At least I'm now confident I will get treatment and return to action soon,” said Naya. The firm's representative Kate Arudo said they would follow up on Naya's treatment at full length. “We are committed to Naya's recovery and will sponsor his chemotherapy sessions to help him fight his ailment. Naya is full of potential and we look forward to his full recovery,"  said Arudo
