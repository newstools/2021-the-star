Three people died on Thursday morning following an accident involving a 14-seater matatu in Kibarani at the Makupa causeway. The Kitui-bound matatu, which was heading towards the Changamwe roundabout, rolled down from the upper road of the causeway to the lower side before hitting an oncoming canter. Coast regional traffic enforcement officer Peter Maina said the accident occurred around 7am when the matatu driver lost control. Maina said they lost three people. Five who were injured were rushed to the Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital. “Investigations were underway to ascertain the cause of the accident,” he said. According to canter driver Daniel Omondi, they were from Nairobi Chloride heading for Mombasa Chloride. “While at the causeway, I noticed a matatu rolling down from the upper side of the road. I had to engage the emergency brake, but the matatu landed on top of us,”  Omondi said. He said that even as the matatu was rolling down, several passengers were seen trying to escape. Asunga Reuben, another occupant of the canter, said, “The driver tried to stop the car, but the brakes failed and the matatu landed on top of us.” The two occupants had minor injuries.
