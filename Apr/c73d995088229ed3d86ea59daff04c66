Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said Kenyans should ignore anti-vax social media propaganda and get vaccinated against Covid-19. Kalonzo said all Kenyans should get the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine since vaccination is the only way to stay safe and keep others safe. “Ningeomba ikiwezekana kila mtu apate chanjo, hi chanjo lazima ipatekane,” Kalonzo said. He spoke during a burial ceremony at Miwongoni Village in Machakos County on Friday. Kalonzo slammed those peddling negative propagand about the vaccine on social media, stating that they should be ignored. “I was vaccinated myself and I am still alive. Everybody should take the jab, it could be the way to save your life,” Kalonzo said. He added, “I congratulate President Samia Suluhu Hassan of Tanzania who took over from the late Pombe Magufuli. "She said herself that Tanzania can’t continue being an island. The statement has brought a lot of hope not only to Tanzanians, but all of us.” Kalonzo said as Tanzaniaa's neighbours, it was a good move for Tanzania to be cautious of Covid-19 and equally take measures to combat it just as its neighboring countries such as Kenya have done. “All of us are neighbours and there is a lot of movement within the borders like Namanga and Oloitoktok. "We are one community of East Africans and if there is a disease that is affecting Tanzania, it will affect us too,” the former Vice President said. “If Tanzanians, Kenyans, Ugandans, South Sudanese, Rwandese have problems, then all of us have problems,” Kalonzo said. “May God protect us, our country and President Uhuru Kenyatta because he is also a human being and he got the jab to show it’s important, hence, everybody should get it,” Kalonzo said.
