President Uhuru Kenyatta has gazetted Dr Jamleck Muturi's appointment as the chairperson of the Teachers Service Commission for a period of six years. In the Gazette notice dated April 29, the President also appointed Timon Oyucho as a member of TSC for a term of six years. Muturi replaces Lydia Nzomo whose six-year term came to an end in November 2020. Nzomo was the first person to chair the TSC after it was made a constitutional commission. She took the oath of office in 2014. The president had nominated Jamleck and Oyucho in March, and the matter was referred by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to the Education committee for vetting. Oyucho had served as a TSC lawyer until his appointment. He led cases against Knut and was instrumental in neutralising the giant teacherâ€™s union. This resulted in staggered terms of office holders; the tenure of the first three commissioners ended in 2019. The other five members will have their terms end in March 2021. Nzomo is credited for key policies on Career Progression Guidelines for teachers that were launched in November 2017. The guidelines replaced the schemes of service. They, however, remain a subject of controversy following opposition by some stakeholders.
