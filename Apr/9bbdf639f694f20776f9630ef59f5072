Education CS George Magoha CS on Wednesday inspected the ongoing KCSE examinations at Kenya High School. He was lead by the school's principal Flora Mulatya. During the inspection, the CS also noted that there are cheating cases that have been reported and some officials have been arrested. Eleven examination officials have been arrested over attempts to expose KCSE examination papers. Magoha said the officials who include center managers and supervisors are from Homa Bay, Mandera, Kisii, Garissa and Kisumu. "I wish to assure the country that these attempts to access the examinations have not interfered with the credibility of the examinations as the exposed questions were never accessed by the candidates," Magoha said. He warned anyone who intends to compromise the integrity of the examinations that tough action will be meted out to them. "Although we have been decisive and ruthless in our pursuit of the masterminds of these unethical practice, we regrettably note that some of them are determined to go to any lengths in a bid to expose the contents of the examination papers once they are released in the morning to schools after 6am," he said. Magoha said they are currently pursuing examination officials who exposed the contents of the Agriculture Paper 1 to some candidates. "Firm action will be taken against the perpetrators. This will help us maintain the integrity of the national examinations, as we have done over the last five years," he said. KCSE students were on Wednesday sitting for their Agriculture Paper 1. Early this month, eight candidates were found with mobile phones in examination rooms. Addressing the media, Magoha said 15 cellphones were also confiscated. "The phones were confiscated from various centres and are with the authorities as investigations continue. We want to find out what are in the phones," he said.
