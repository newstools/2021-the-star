As preparations for Kenya's return to the World Rally Championships hits top gear, the organisers of the Safari Rally have revealed a section they believe will offer the teams a true taste of the country's scenery. The 9.71kms SS16 Malewa section around Lake Naivasha will be navigated onÂ June 27 with the first car being flagged off at 10:52 hours with route Liaison-cum-Media Safety Officer Anwar Sidi observing that the section will also test the driver's skill and experience. It is a rocky section, with a lot of ninety-degree junctions across the hilly terrain. "The loose surface will make drivers who will be looking to preserve their tyres in the best conditions for the power stage think carefully about their driving lines. It is Safari," said Sidi. The 10.56kms Power Stage which marks the last stage will be run twice as SS15 / SS18 at 09:08 /13:18hours respectively at Hell's Gate National Park with the second run (CS18) being aired live across the globe. The power stage will showcase Kenya's geothermal energy plant in Naivasha, the Great Rift Valley as well as lakes Naivasha and Elmenteita. The Service Park will be based at the KWS Training Institute, Naivasha on the main Nairobi - Nakuru Highway. Administrative checks will begin on June 21 in Naivasha as well as reconnaissance. Reconnaissance will continue until June 23. Shakedown will follow within the Ndulele Conservancy. June 24 will be equally eventful where reconnaissance of the Kasarani Spectator Stage (SS1), will happen from 07:30hrs, prior to a press conference at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre at 11:00hrs. The Ceremonial Start at 12:46hrs will mark the return of Safari Rally to Nairobi after an absence of nearly two decades. WRC cars driven by the best in the world will begin their 2021 WRC Safari Rally campaign in earnest with a side-by-side race on the purpose-built Super Special Stage (SSS) at Kasarani from 14:08 hours.
