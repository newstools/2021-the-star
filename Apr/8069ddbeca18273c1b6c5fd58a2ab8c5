The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority on Wednesday distributed ARVs worth Sh444 million in the Western region. Some 389,551 patients across seven counties will benefit from the medicine. Kisumu Kemsa regional distribution coordinator Kenneth Bukachi said the counties are Migori, Kisumu, Nyamira, Vihiga, Siaya, Kakamega and Bungoma. He said the supplies were a big relief to patients who had been receiving half the regular rations of the life-saving drugs. "We are scaling up the monthly distribution cycle to cover the region's demand  and ensure that supplies are not disrupted," Dr Bukachi said. Kisumu, which has HIV prevalence of 17.3 per cent, had run out of ARVs meant for children since February. Deputy Governor Mathews Owili said the county has 113,570 HIV patients on ARVs. "We are appealing to the government and the USAID to immediately end the stand-off over a drug consignment at the port. This is because we are not out of the woods yet," he said. Owili asked residents to go for HIV testing to establish their status. "Knowing your status is the beginning of taking control of  your life and future," he said Owili said Kisumu county used to conduct 10,000 viral tests each month before the kits ran out. "The shortage has forced us to reduce the tests to only 284 per month since March," he said. He said the reduction was a risk of misdiagnosis and affected treatment for clients on antiretroviral therapy. Edited by A.N
