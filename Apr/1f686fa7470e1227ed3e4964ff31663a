A quarter-final slot awaits General Service Unit following their  3-0 win over Rwanda's Espoir in their last Group 'D' match at the ongoing African Club Championships in Tunisia. The paramilitary side was in a class of their own as they toyed with the Rwandans in a 25-11, 25-14, 25-12 performance. The former champions, under Gideon Tarus, put the opening day 3-0 defeat in the hands of Zamalek to bed to reignite their last eight hopes with a 3-1 win over Nigeria Customs on Monday. Despite winning the opening set, the West Africans were put to the sword in sets of 23-25, 25-16, 25-22, 25-18. GSU won the title in 2018, the only team to stop Al Ahly's dominance in the competition in recent years. The Egyptian side, who boast of 14 titles since the inception of the tournament in 1980, are out of this year's edition. Meanwhile, newbies Kenya Ports Authority dismantled Burundi's Rukinzo 3-0 in straight sets of  25-23, 25-10, 25-19. The first two teams in each pool qualify for the quarter-finals slated for Friday while the last two play in the classification matches starting on Thursday. The semi-finals will be played on April 26.
