A court on Friday handed Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala a reprieve in staying the decision by NASA senators to dethrone him as Senate deputy Minority leader seat. The lawmaker would thus have his job back until his petition challenging the ouster is heard and determined by the Political Parties Tribunal. He told the court that his removal was unprocedural, unilateral, unlawful and violated the NASA coalition agreement between ODM and four political parties, hence null and void. The court granted the Senator as well as concerned parties seven days to file and serve their responses to the application. NASA senators on March 24 replaced Malala with Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo of ODM at the height of the upheavals among the coalition’s partners. The Kakamega Senator’s troubles intensified after he supported the ANC candidate in the Matungu MP by-election. He sued ODM with Madzayo, ANC, and Wiper, Chama cha Mashinani, Office of Registar of Political Parties, and Ford Kenya as interested parties. He was at loggerheads with the ODM party - which has majority seats in the coalition, for disrespecting the party's leader Raila Odinga. Minority leader James Orengo convened  the meeting where NASA senators endorsed Malala's removal. The decision split the coalition partners as some members abstained from signing the petition to remove the Senator. Malala told the court that at the time of filing the complaint, no member of the coalition had formally opted out of the coalition and the power-sharing agreement. He argued that the instruments are binding on all the partners.
