 A man suspected to have murdered his girlfriend in Naivasha has surrendered to the police after being on the run for days. The suspect confessed to killing 30-year-old Beth Mwihaki in Kayole estate for allegedly having other sexual affairs with other men. A postmortem report indicated the mother of two was murdered by strangulation using a piece of cloth inside her house in the estate located off the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Police have also established that a ransom note demanding Sh2 million from the family of the victim was authored by the suspect with a view to throwing investigators off track. A source privy to the investigations said the suspect arrived at the station with some relatives and confessed to the murder. The officer added that the 22-year-old was the first suspect and went into hiding moments after the body was discovered by relatives. “From phone records, the young man was implicated in the murder and the ransom note was meant to implicate the former husband,” said the source. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru confirmed the incident, adding that the suspect would be charged with murder when the investigation file is complete. “The suspect has surrendered to our officers following the murder of the woman and we shall take the necessary steps before charging him,” Waweru said. A sister to the deceased, Ruth Wanjiku, narrated how they decided to check on Mwihaki after she failed to open her business or respond to their phone calls. She said the victim was previously married but separated with the husband. They didn’t know the motive behind the killing. “After she was killed, the killers locked the door from outside and we had to break in where we found her body,” she said. Lakeview MCA Simon Wanyoike who was among the first people on the scene expressed his concern over the increase in insecurity cases. Edited by Henry Makori
