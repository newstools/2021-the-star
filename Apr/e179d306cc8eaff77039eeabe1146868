Vera Sidika says she has never snatched a married man from their spouse. Vera was responding to fans who said that she snatched her husband Brown Mauzo from Amber Ray. She added that Ray never had a romantic relationship with Mauzo and their rumoured affair was all showbiz. "Never done this nonsense in my life! I never date a man in a relationship at all. Shindwe! My hubby was extremely single when he met me and I was single as well. The said lady has never been in a romantic relationship with him either, it was purely business." Vera also sought to clarify that she got married to Mauzo on October 12 last year and they will do a white wedding when the time is right. Brown Mauzo has two children (boy and girl) from his past relationships. Before Mauzo, Vera has dated millionaires and billionaires, but she said she was not happy.
