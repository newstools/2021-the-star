Michael Olunga snatched a last-gasp winner to grab a hat-trick in the process and steer Al Duhail to a hard-fought 4-3 win over a resilient Iranian side Esteghlal, in Group 'C' of the Asian Champions League in Jeddah on Wednesday With only five minutes left for the sides to share spoils at 3-3, Olunga hit the bull's eye on the turn to propel Al Duhail to the summit of their group, a point clear of Esteghlal. Al Ahli of Saudi Arabia are now placed third following their 3-0 win over Iraq’s Al Shorta. It's only the group winners who will secure a slot in the next phase of the competition. Esteghlal drew the first blood in the 4th minute when Amir Motahari nodded home before Olunga leveled the terms after firing from close range six minutes later. And in the 27th minute, Olunga doubled Al Duhail's advantage only for Cheick Diabate to restore parity again seven minutes later. Unfazed, Al Duhail advanced a relentless onslaught on their opponents' territory and it wasn't long before their efforts came to fruition. Abdullah Abdulsalam pounced on a glaring chance six yards out and made good use of it to gift the Qatari side the half-time lead. Esteghlal came back rejuvenated after the interval and 15 into play they balanced the scoreline from Farshid Esmaeili’s header. However, Esteghlal had not had enough of Al Duhail just yet. Olunga's last-minute effort with only five minutes left on the clock hit the final nail on the Iranians casket. Clubs in the western half of Asia are playing the group phase of this year’s Asian Champions League in a series of centralised venues due to the ongoing pandemic. The winners of the 10 groups across the competition will qualify for the last 16 alongside the six best runners up, with games in the east of the continent due to be played in June and July. The knockout phase of the Asian Champions League is scheduled to be held from September.
