Popular Rhumba artiste Papa Lando has released a new hit 'Tumbler' featuring Arrow Bwoy. The two musicians echo their love for tumblers and curvy African women, sampling melodies from classic African hits: 'Momou' by Franco, 'Salome' by Saida Karoli, and Flavour’s 'Nwa Baby'. Speaking on how the collaboration came to be, Papa Lando says they met coincidentally in a studio where they both record and started freestyling to a beat and ended up recording this tune. “I have always been a fan of Arrow Bwoy’s music and I am glad that we finally got to work together.” Tumbler’s release follows other Papa Lando’s collaborations, 'Ex', featuring P-Unit’s Gabu and 'Pesa Ni Maua' featuring Padi Wubbon. Tumbler will be part of Papa Lando’s upcoming album, 'Mbogi Ya Rhumba', which will adopt a distinct approach by fusing urban rhumba sounds, Swahili and Lingala.
