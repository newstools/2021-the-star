Elders from Garissa have cautioned residents of northern Kenya to be wary of a section of leaders from Somalia out to incite them against the government. The elders said the leaders are using the media to peddle propaganda aimed at creating "bad blood between Kenyans and the government". The elders, led by Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chair Dubat Amey, spoke to the press in Garissa town. “Somalian leaders are using the media to incite Kenyans against the government. We want to pass on one message to the leaders that we Kenyans are committed to this country. We support the leadership of this country," he said. Amey said Somalian leaders should use their energy resolve problems facing their country and not meddle in Kenyan affairs. “We want to tell the Somalian authorities to please concentrate on their problems. Solve the problems of your country and keep off Kenyan affairs.” Amey thanked the Kenyan leadership under President Uhuru Kenyatta ‘for restraining itself against all provocations and naked hostility from Somalia’. Mid-last month, Somalia severed diplomatic ties with Kenya, accusing it of violating its sovereignty and meddling in its internal affairs before the general election. Amey said Kenya has done a lot of favours to Somalia by hosting over 500,000 refugees at the vast Dadaab camps in Garissa county.
