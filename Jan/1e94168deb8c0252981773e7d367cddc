By WANGECHI WANG’ONDU  Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirichi has hailed the sentencing to 140 years in jail for a man who was convicted for defiling and impregnating his two daughters. John Gichira Gichini from Kirinyaga county pleaded guilty to two counts of defiling and impregnating his step daughters. Ngirichi said the punishment meted on the convict will serve as lesson of what the law can unleash to molesters and violators of children’s rights. “I’m pleased that finally justice has been delivered to the victims. It's high time that society and particularly parents start acting right and stand to defend their children rather than destroy their future,”Ngirichi said. She was speaking in Mwea during the issuance of women affirmative action fund cheques to four groups. The MP promised to continue championing for the right of girls who are vulnerable to sex predators. She also called on residents to report any rape or defilement case for quick action. Ngirichi said children have a right to study and to be protected from sexual, emotional and physical harm until they are old enough to make informed decisions. Gichini was sentenced on Thursday by Baricho law courts senior principal magistrate Antony Mwicigi following his conviction last week. He was also found guilty of incest. The court noted that though the accused was not related to the victims by blood, he was related to them through marriage, hence committed incest “Considering that he has completely destroyed their lives, this court is minded to consider a sentence of imprisonment of 70 years for each charge. Further, considering that there were two victims which aggravates the offence, these sentences shall run consecutively,”Mwichigi ruled.  Edited by P.O
