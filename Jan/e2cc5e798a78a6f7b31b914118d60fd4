Factional wars at LSK were laid bare on Monday as passions flared, degenerating its special general meeting into a chaotic shouting match. It all ended in the resignation of one of the council members Roseline Odede. She told the gathering that being in the society's council was emotionally draining and frustrating. Each faction set to outfox each other with one led by its President Nelson Havi. Another group aligned to the eight council members attended mainly online. Only a few turned up physically. Havi's group, comprising mainly of young lawyers, took charge of the meeting, shouting down any voice that was dissenting or perceived to be opposing him. Three main motions were to be considered, including the removal of Havi from the helm of the society, appointment of the auditor to review LSK's books and the position of Chief executive Mercy Wambua. Deciding on who would vote also proved emotive, with the Havi group wanting only the side physically present to participate. They objected to the online team voting. "By sidelining the online team from participating, you're doing a great disservice to members and this is unacceptable," Carolyne Mutheu, a council member said. The physical attendees who were the pro-Havi group passed his proposals.
