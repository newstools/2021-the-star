Three people died in a road accident involving a sugar cane tractor and matatu on Sunday night on the Rongo-Migori highway. Two passengers died on the spot while the matatu driver succumbed to his injuries at Royal Hospital in Rongo on Monday. Rongo deputy police boss Zebedee Amsama said the tractor travelling from Migori to Rongo skidded to the right side of the road after a tyre burst and because it had only one headlight, the matatu driver mistook it for a motorbike. “A matatu belonging to Homa Bay Transport Sacco travelling in the opposite direction rammed into the tractor,” Amsama said. The vehicle was carrying 13 passengers, five more than the eight recommended to curb the spread of Covid-19. “Three passengers had leg fractures while one had a head fracture, the rest were treated and discharged,” Amsama said. He said that most cane tractors are not roadworthy. “We need a law passed for them to avoid transporting their cane at night, most carry extra load, have no light, reflectors and are poorly serviced,” he said. Amsama said laws streamlining sugar cane transport should be put in place to avoid further accidents. Nominated MP Dennitah Ghati has called on the government to regulate sugar cane tractors in Rongo to avoid similar accidents. Ghati said the traffic police and the National Transport Safety Authority should regularly check the roadworthiness of tractors. They should be banned from transporting cane at night, she said.
