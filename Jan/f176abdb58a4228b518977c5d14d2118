Controversial city entrepreneur Joyce Akinyi could lose two of her cars to the government if a court grants a request by the Asset Recovery Agency. The agency told a judge the vehicles were acquired through monies that are proceeds of criminal activity. ARA began investigations into how the properties were acquired by Akinyi after she was charged in court with a drug trafficking offence. Akinyi had been arrested on July 13, 2019, at Deep West Resort in Nairobi and arraigned. The agency believes that the properties it was going after were accrued to her through the trafficking of narcotics. During her arrest, the officers conducted a search and found 1,050 grams of heroin in her house. The agency told the court that it had information that Akinyi acquired massive assets and properties using the proceeds from the trade of narcotic drugs. Investigations revealed that she used her account held at Stanbic Bank as a conduit for laundering proceeds of crime. “Unless this honourable court grants the orders sought, the economic advantage derived from the commission of crimes will continue to benefit a few to the disadvantage of national security, interest, economy and general interest,” the agency said. In an affidavit in support of the application, police officer Fredrick Muriuki says the investigations against Akinyi started in 2000 when she allegedly ventured into acquisition, sale and distribution of drugs together with her estranged husband, Nigerian national Anthony Chinedu. Together, the two registered a company called Deep West Resort in 2010 to disguise the proceeds of the drug trade. On March 31, 2015, Akinyi was arrested at Dam II estate in Langata with 31.6 grams of heroin with a market value of Sh94,800 and later on charged. She was again arrested in 2019. Eight drug mules were also arrested and charged. Of the eight, four are Kenyans while the other four are from Cameroon, Congo, Nigeria and Pakistan.
