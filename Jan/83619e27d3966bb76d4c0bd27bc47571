Mathare United head coach Salim Ali is a relieved man after guiding the club to their first win in the Football Kenya Federation Premier League 2020-2021 season. The 2008 league champions saw off Zoo FC 2-0 yesterday at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani, to bag their first win of the season after a sour start which saw them fall 4-2 to Sofapaka and 3-1 to Gor Mahia. Ali, who was full of praise for the players for keeping a clean-sheet, said the win had cooled off their wait for their first in the campaign. First-half goals by Daniel Otieno and John Mwangi condemned Zoo to their first loss of the season. “Getting a win after three rounds is good for us as we plan for our next matches. I still consider our league matches as part of our pre-season and the fitness levels are improving,” said the former player at the club. While Ali can afford a sigh of relief after the win, his Zoo counterpart Herman Iswekha denied being under pressure to deliver his first win of the season. Zoo drew Bandari and Ulinzi Stars in their opening rounds. Elsewhere, South Sudan international Tito Okello blasted home a brace as Gor Mahia switched off Western Stima 3-1 at the Moi Stadium, Kisumu to bag their third win of the season. Okello, who joined the defending champions from Uganda’s Vipers in the last transfer window, opened his goal account in the 65th minute before completing his double in the dying minutes of the game. Samuel Onyango had plundered home the opening goal for the visitors in the18th minute but Villa Oromchan leveled for the hosts in the 37th minute.
