The Kenya Editors Guild is reevaluating the state of journalism and media, which it says is at a crossroads in the face of Covid-19. The editors are touring counties gathering views and recommendations from journalists to come up with a post-Covid policy document. Speaking to journalists in Kiambu on Thursday, member David Makali said stakeholders in the industry as well as the government need to come up with systems to ensure the sector survives after the pandemic. "The media is a significant central player in the country's governance. We must make sure it doesn't die. Imagine a situation where you do not have mainstream media and we must depend on social media platforms? The consequences will be dire," Makali said. He said meetings are an ongoing to figure out the future and make sure journalism and the media is sustainable. The guild, Makali said, is convening various fora to reach out to stakeholders and bring on board all views that will be put together into a policy document. It will then recommend how emerging challenges can be tackled. Editors guild member and media trainer Ken Bosire said the interactions are important because when Covid-19 struck, a lot of things changed. "The practice of journalism must be allowed to grow and must be sustained," Bosire said.
