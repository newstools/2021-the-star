   West Pokot county  will commence the construction of a mango and milk processing plants this January. Speaking to the Star on Wednesday, the county executive for trade and  industry Francis Kitalawian said tenders for the projects have already been advertised “These are the  projects that we are handling this year, residents should be patient since they will no longer be exploited by middlemen,” he said. He said the county has a clear road map on how the projects are going to be implemented so that it can benefit farmers directly. Last year the county carried out feasibility study on the establishment of the two plants. The county produces milk and mangoes in large quantities but farmers are exploited by middlemen who buy the produce at throw away prices. “This county is famed for milk with highest fat content and to tap on this huge potential the county government had decided to invest in the plant,” he said. Kitalawian said that farmers from the region have been exploited by middlemen for long and it is time time the county government stepped in to ensure they benefit. “Farmers in this region cannot determine the price of the milk, the decision is left in the hands of middle men,” he said. The county has the potential to produce over 50,000 litres of milk daily on average. “During dry spell the county has the potential to produce over 38.1% and during peak season 40.2%,” he said. He said the plant will also offer employment to youths and help reduce some of the outdated  cultural practices.
