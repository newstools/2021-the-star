A woman from Ndia, Kirinyaga, who is suspected to have killed her five-year-old sick son by ‘casting out demons’ was Monday arraigned in Baricho. Miriam Wambui did not take a plea for murder as the court, through senior principal magistrate Monica Kivuti, allowed a request by the police to have the suspect detained for seven more days as they complete investigations. “The seven-day period will allow for a postmortem exercise to be conducted on the deceased, psychiatric examination on the suspect and enable investigators to record the suspect’s statement and fingerprints,” said Boaz Serem, the lead investigator. It is alleged that Wambui, an Akorino believer, committed the offence on January 21 in Mukui village by strangling the child to death as she conducted prayers and 'exorcised demons’. The suspect will be locked up at the Sagana police station awaiting mention of the case on February 2. Speaking to the press, Mose Gichero Ngotho, who is the senior acting bishop of Aroti Apostolic Fellowship Church where she is a congregant, distanced claims that his church subscribes to corrupt rituals and outrageous doctrines. “She joined us in mid-October last year and all along her husband and three children have been worshipping at our church," Ngotho said. "We don’t indoctrinate bad faith in our members. We believe in seeking medical attention at health facilities as well as educating our children in schools.” Ngotho heads about 70 members in three churches across Kirinyaga. He added that he is ready to have the conduct of his church investigated by the government should there be a need.
