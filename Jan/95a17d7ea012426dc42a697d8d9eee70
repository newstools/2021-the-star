President Uhuru Kenyatta is working to economically empower Kenyans, Public Service CS Magret Kobia has said. Kobia said Uhuru has let her ministry lead empowerment programmes that change the lives of mwananchi, including the Women Enterprise Fund. Speaking in Chuka town on Tuesday when she issued Sh13 million to Tharaka Nithi women's groups, the CS said the fund has transformed many lives and urged more women to join hands and apply to benefit from the kitty. Kobia said Covid-19 has destroyed and disintegrated family and community ties as many people have lost their livelihoods due to the pandemic. She said coronavirus or not, life has to continue and that is why the President opened up the economy. She urged women to network with county commissioner Beverly Opwora so they can get information when government projects are carried out for the benefits of their families. “You can’t support the President if you are not supporting the county commissioner. We can’t continue arguing about Covid-19 when our people are getting poor. The President’s agenda is to entrench peace, unity and fighting poverty but of all importance is economic empowerment. The main problem with women is not repaying the money they borrow,” she said. Kobia said it is time the society turned attention to the 'forgotten' boy-child. “We have talked so much and channelled energy and resources on women and girls empowerment but let us not forget the boy-child. We have cases of many boys who are not attending school. Some are out on small businesses. Some are enticed to continue with their boda boda enterprise. We must ensure they are in school," she said. “When we empower women, it doesn’t mean we disempower men. Boys should not be disadvantaged. Let us be inclusive. Boys need to make a contribution to the society for a better future.”  Edited by Henry Makori
