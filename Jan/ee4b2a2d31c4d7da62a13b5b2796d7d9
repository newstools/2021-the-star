Police have joined the probe into how a senior military officer allegedly committed suicide in his house in Lanet, Nakuru County. The officer of the rank of Major attached to 81 Tank Battalion at the Lanet Barracks was found dead in his toilet after he had allegedly slit his throat. He used a kitchen knife to commit the offence. His body in full uniform was found in a pool of blood long after the incident had happened on Wednesday evening. The military police called the local civilian police after they had been alerted the officer was dead. The motive behind the incident is yet to be established and the body was moved to a local mortuary waiting for postmortem. Cases of suicide in the service have been on the increase in an alarming rate calling for attention from authorities. Most of the personnel in uniform are usually stressed because of the nature of their work, officials say. For the military, they have rehabilitation programmes in all bases to address some of the issues related to mental status. Officials said they had constructed a wellness centre to take care of more than Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The centre is based at Langâ€™ata barracks in Nairobi. Officials argued the wellness centre and the sports complex are a true indication that the KDF is looking out for a wholesome approach to the welfare of its officers and servicemen and can even go a long way in helping the civilian population. It is the largest referral centre that the KDF says will be key in pre and post-war experiences. The facility uses more experts and gives a wide range of mental health issues that are of great help to the personnel. The facility is to also care for children born with special needs such as autism, and guide parents to care for such children.Ends
