Vihiga county has withheld January pay for striking health workers until further notice. Health executive Amos Kutwa said if the strike continues, the county will have no alternative but to dismiss the strikers. “We shall dismiss them and readvertise those posts for new applicants to take over to rescue the ailing health sector," he said. The county executive had given the striking workers 48 hours to resume their duties. He said they will not watch as residents undergo physical and psychological anguish in seeking medical services because of strikes. But Kenya National Union of Nurses chairman Zadock Miheso said those were empty threats not worth complying with. “Our strike is legal and if the county has an issue they should challenge it in court, not in the media,” Miheso told the Star. Health workers went on strike December 7, disrupting medical services in public hospitals. The majority of residents have had to rely on private facilities, but the cost implications have seen some patients resign to fate. “We have been patient enough trying to reason out with them but it’s like we are just wasting our time as the county residents continue to suffer,” Kutwa said. He expressed concern that the majority of residents depend on public facilities, but the strike has crippled operations, hence causing untold suffering. Chief officer for medical services Arnold Mamadi said a huge population in the county is unable to seek services in private facilities because of poverty. “A very small population is able to access health services on private facilities,” Mamadi said. He said Vihiga is a rural county, with the majority seeking services from level 2 and 3 facilities. “In the past system of governance, Vihiga was overlooked, with the central government pumping resources to Kisumu and Kakamega which were provincial headquarters,” Mamadi said.
