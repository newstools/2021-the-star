 The Meru county government has donated a 10-acre parcel of land to Kemsa to establish a warehouse to ease logistics in the distribution of medical supplies to counties in upper eastern and Northeastern regions. The land is in Ruiri Rwarera ward in Buuri subcounty. The centre will be a replica of Kenya Medical Supplies Authority's mega warehouses in Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa. Meru will become the fourth county with a Kemsa warehouse. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi said the regional distribution centre will solve the age-old problem of lack of drugs and medical supplies to hospitals across the region. “I thank Kemsa for good relations as they are a very reliable supplier of drugs even when we do not have ready cash. We now have marked improvement on drugs. The old stories of no drugs in hospitals are things of the past. We want to intensify and expand,” Kiraitu said. Kemsa board chairman Kembi Gitura said the Meru warehouse will ease delivery and shorten the time and distance in supplying Embu, Mandera, Marsabit, Laikipia, Tharaka Nithi and Isiolo counties. “We accept this generous land grant to build a distribution centre in Meru. We have Mombasa, Nairobi and Kisumu centres. This new warehouse will ease pressure on Nairobi. We want orders on pharmaceuticals and other commodities delivered on time as we operationalise UHC. I see our vision and dream come true," Gitura said. He added, "We will work with partners and I'm confident the distribution centre will be a game changer. We don’t take this for granted. Our mandate is big but we cannot do it without cooperation with counties.”  Edited by P.O
