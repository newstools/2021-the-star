Those supporting Deputy President William Ruto presidential bid in Western will have a rough time selling the idea in Western, Vihiga Woman Representative Beatrice Adagala has said. She said those in DP Ruto’s team are there for handouts and not to push his agenda. “For those who have been playing divide and rule kind of politics in western so that they can use our votes to thrive this is not the right time,” Adagala said. The lawmaker spoke to the Star on the phone on Friday. MPs Charles Gimose (Hamisi), Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula) and Malulu Injendi (Malava) are some of the lawmakers in Western in DP’s camp. Gimose dismissed Adalaga's sentiments, saying she is just a "toddler" in politics and she should first gain more experience. "Handouts have been there since time immemorial, so you can't just wake up and say I'm in DP Ruto camp for handouts," he said. MP Barasa said he is fully supporting DP Ruto and nothing will change his stand. "I'm fully supporting the DP. Other stories have no value to me," he said. Mabonga wasn't in a position to speak, saying he was at a funeral at the time. Adagala also said the unity pact that was recently formed by ANC leader Musali Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula is proof that the duo will work together. “When two joins hands and work together they will give us ample time to front one candidate for the presidential race,” Adagala said. The lawmaker said Musalia Mudavadi is a strong politician with vast experience in matters of leadership and economic recovery. “Musalia has held various ministerial posts ever since he joined Parliament so  I believe he is the best to take over,” she cited. She said Mudavadi is one of the most experienced economists in the country who can revive Kenya’s ailing economy and fight strongly to reduce the huge country’s debt.
