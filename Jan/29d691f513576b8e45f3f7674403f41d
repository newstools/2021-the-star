Kenya International midfielder Willis Okeyo is optimistic of joining the Kenya team for the African Cup of Nations qualifiers despite being left out of the current squad. The two-time Premier League title winner with Kenya Police is yet to receive communication from the selectors but believes his experience will be key if the youthful side is to excel. Okeyo, who has more than 60 caps for the country, has consistently played for Kenya team since making a debut  in the Olympic qualifiers in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe in 2013 under  coach Meshack Senge. The 36-year-old is still regarded as one of the best players in his position despite age and he is known for his relentless energy and ball winning abilities as a central midfielder. "I have always worked hard for the country. I have been one of the fittest and regular players and I have always performed. My career is slowly winding down but I still have much in the locker room. I am open to representing Kenya in the qualifiers in March on home soil," he noted. Okeyo had a one-month stint with Germany side, Stuttgart and he is the current United States International University (USIU-A) Spartans coach. Okeyo said his playing position  requires dynamism and is ready to teach whoever succeeds him how to handle the position.
