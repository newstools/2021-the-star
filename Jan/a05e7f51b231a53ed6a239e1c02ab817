Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has challenged Deputy President William Ruto to subject himself to a lifestyle audit. Kalonzo said the DP has a known history for grabbing both public and private land. The former vice-president was responding to claims by DP that he (Kalonzo) grabbed that Yatta land where his family house sits. "I challenge DP Ruto alias 'Arap Mashamba' well known for his greed for both public and private land, to offer himself for investigation," Kalonzo said. He was speaking on Monday at a Nairobi hotel. The latest salvo comes days after Kalonzo accused the DP of nepotism in regards to government appointments. Kalonzo said Ruto should stop portraying himself as a nationalist and the DP's true colours were laid bare on how he distributed his 50 per cent share of government in 2013. Kalonzo claimed Ruto went as far as pushing out some Cabinet Secretaries from other communities to pave the way for politically correct individuals. The Wiper leader said Ruto should stop casting a nationalistic figure when he proved to be the worst when he was in a position of influence in 2013. "Who doesn’t know that President Uhuru Kenyatta got 50 per cent of the government, William Ruto got 50 per cent of the government to the exclusion of everybody else?  At least President Uhuru took his 50 per cent as a national leader,” Kalonzo said. He added: “What did his counterpart [Ruto] do? Look at the structure of the government, you will be amazed.” In what appears to be a simultaneous onslaught by Nasa bigwigs, on Monday ODM leader also questioned Ruto’s nationalistic ideology, saying the events of 2013 are still fresh in the memory of Kenyans. According to the AU special envoy, all Ruto’s appointments were ethnic-based, especially in key parastatals and government agencies.
