A two-legged calf born in Tigania village, Meru county, has turned to be a tourist attraction. The calf with only two rear legs does not have a single sign or trace there would be a possible section for forelegs. Speaking to the Star at his home, Joshua Baariu who is the owner of the calf that was born on Sunday, said it had stopped them from doing their daily chores because many people were coming from far to see it. “The calf is healthy and you may not realise it lacks the rear legs because it sits like normal calves and it has no other problem or deformity‚” he said. Baariu said people are coming from far away to see the calf and pleaded with the government to assist with funds to buy its feed. “We are shocked but this is a blessed family of the Antubaita clan. The blessings have been associated with us since the Mboa migration of the Ameru. I will offer anything that has blood at the  church,” he said. “We wish the county or national government can buy it or rent it for showcasing during the  agricultural shows. I am grateful to God because the calf is so smart and looks very healthy. It always tries to stand on its two legs,” Baariu’s daughter-in-law said. She said she thanks God for such a gift because she has been tethering the cow and feeding it very well all through. “I have no other cow. It calved at night and we thought the legs were cut off mysterious but several days search yielded no fruit. We later realised there was no sign of the calf having the forelegs‚” the daughter in law said. Purity Kaari, a neighbour, said she has never seen such an occurrence in her life. A source at the Meru branch National Museums of Kenya said they do not handle livestock and anyone must get a trading license in such a scenario. There was a similar male calf born in a village in Shandong province, East China, with missing two front legs and could not stand up on its own. In 2018, there was one calf with hind legs in Indonesia.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
