Lamu security department has announced a crackdown for schoolgirls who fell pregnant during the Covid-19 period and haven’t reported back to school. The plan, which is meant to ensure every learner—pregnant or not—goes back to school, is also looking into arresting parents of schoolgirls who got married during the long holiday. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia said the girls will be dragged from the marriages and sent back to class, while the parents will be prosecuted. Speaking in Lamu yesterday, Macharia said men who will be found to have impregnated the girls will face the law. The county administration boss said they intend to ensure 100 per cent of school children report back to their respective schools. He said over 70 per cent of learners in the region reported back to school on the January 4 when schools reopened countrywide having closed for close to 10 months because of Covid. Chiefs have been given direct orders to arrest any children of school-going age and are not in school so the parents can explain why. The commissioner said the crackdown involves a house-to-house search for schoolchildren, more so girls, to ensure they go back to school. “Whether you are pregnant or not, you need to be in school and we shall ensure just that. The turnout was great, an indication that students still have the desire to learn,” Macharia said. He said schoolboys who have been employed in various sectors as labourers will be also be taken back to school.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
