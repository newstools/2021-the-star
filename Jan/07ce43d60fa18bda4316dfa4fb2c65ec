Kenya Commercial Bank captain Noel Murambi has blamed poor reception and blocks for their 3-1 loss to Kenya Prisons yesterday at the Nyayo Stadium. Murambi said the defeat was an eye-opener and promised to bounce back to winning ways in the second leg next month. “It was a good match to gauge our progress and all is not lost despite the defeat. We have now known our weakness and we will no doubt work on our reception and blocks going forward,” said the left attacker Murambi. Her Prisons’ counterpart Bracksides Agala praised her side for a job well done. “It was a good performance from everyone and we will build on the win,” she said. Prisons’ Immaculate Chemutai, decorated former national team captain Agala and Joy Luseneka proved too strong for the bankers in the first two sets. They won the first set by 26-24 and 28-26 in the second after a 19-19 tie at some point. Fast-rising KCB setter Immaculate Nekesa was the star performer for bankers, who rediscovered their winning mettle to seal third set 25-21 with Sharon Chepchumba as the key performer. Prisons’ Pamela Masaisai received plaudits for her starring role in the last set as Josp Barasa’s troops won 25-16 to seal the match 3-1. In another match, Kenya Pipeline beat Nairobi Prisons 25-17, 25-17 and 25-15 in their match. In the men’s category, defending champions General Service Unit beat Equity Bank 3-2 in a five-setter thus 25-16, 21-25, 25-18, 22-25, and 15-13. During the match, Equity coach Sammy Kirongo was visibly animated with his charges’ sloppy reception in the second set. In another match played at Kamiti Prisons, Kenya Prisons demolished Kenya Army 3-0 (25-15, 25-22, 25-16).
