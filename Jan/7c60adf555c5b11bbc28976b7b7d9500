Kitui South residents are desperately trying to scare off swarms of locusts after heavy rains and wind made aerial spraying impossible. They are keeping round-the-clock vigils on their fairs. They are yelling, whistling, banging pots and pans and lighting bonfires. Rains started on Thursday when a military fixed-wing aircraft arrived and water would have diluted the insecticide. Spraying attempts were to resume on Sunday. The rain arrived at the same time as the military aircraft so the operation was called off. “The aircraft only sprayed one place in Kanziku ward three times for 30 minutes but it had to stop because of rain. Some locusts were killed," Kanziku MCA James Munuve said. He said the swarm that invaded his ward has split into two, with one infesting neighbouring Ikutha ward. One swarm remains in Mutha ward. “The swarms are wreaking havoc on crops as aerial spraying is impossible in the rain," he said The MP said locusts were concentrated in Mwangala and Muthue in Kanziku ward; Ngomano and Mavia, Imiw’a and Ngomano in Ikutha ward and at Kivandini and Ilamba in Mutha ward. Politician Micheal Kivoto said the insects had caused major crop damage in his  Muthue village. He said the government must use stronger measures or all the crops will be devoured. "There must be accelerated efforts to eradicate the insects," Kivoto said. Kitui Deputy Governor Wathe Nzau said the rains had halted aerial spraying for three days. He said they hoped to resume spraying on Sunday. “It was unlikely the locusts had caused a lot of damage to crops. It is raining and the swarm is a bit docile and not too aggressive," Nzau said.
