Immediate former Gor Mahia left-back Shafik Batambuze has joined Zambia's Kabwe Warriors, ending his long search for a new club. The league-winning defender with Tusker in 2016 joined Gor in November 2018 replacing his Ugandan counterpart Godfrey Walusimbi, who mysteriously sneaked to join South African giants Kaizer Chiefs. Batambuze,who began his tenure with an international friendly match against Everton was released by the club late last year after being sidelined for a year due to a nagging knee injury. The former Western Stima man had gone under the knife in November 2019, two months after an injury  incurred during Gor's Caf Champions League preliminary encounter against Aigle Noir of Burundi at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The setback to the player christened as Bachu saw Kógallo headhunt Michael Apudo from Posta Rangers to assist Geoffrey Ochieng in filling his shoes. Batambuze, who has had stints with Muhoroni Youth and Sofapaka is among the few players whom the break brought about by the Covid-1,  turned out to be a blessing in disguise as he used the period to recover. He was, however, missing when Gor unveiled their squad for the new season which began in November with reports indicating that he parted ways with the club on mutual consent. Batambuze, who was part of the Uganda Cranes team during the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, signed a two-year long deal with the Zambian outfit.
