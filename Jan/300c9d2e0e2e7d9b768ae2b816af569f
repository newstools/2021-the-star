Saying pregnancy is not a disease, Education CS George Magoha has ordered the immediate hunt for pregnant schoolgirls who are yet to report to class. Speaking In Bungoma on Friday, Magoha said it was mandatory for children to get back to school, ordering chiefs and other Interior officials to ensure the girls are brought back. “Pregnancy should not be treated like a disease. We are calling upon Interior ministry officials to look for the girls, ensure they receive proper counselling and return them to school," the CS said. He visited Bungoma DEB Secondary School, the largest in the country after Olympic in Nairobi's Kibera slum. He praised schools that have learners study outside in tents or under trees to maintain social distancing because of Covid-19. “We appreciate schools that are innovating to ensure learners continue their education," he said. The CS said the ministry was happy more than 80 per cent of learners returned to school. He said the government had provided enough desks an asked those who had won tenders to deliver them by Monday. “We are calling upon our officers to ensure proper paper work is done so payment is not delayed,” he said. Delayed payment was hurting artisans but so far Sh500 million had been paid, Magoha said. The CS again warned school heads against sending away learners for lack of fees, saying they should be considerate because of the economic hardship caused by Covid-19. “For primary schools and secondary schools we should not even have any debate. No one should send learners home because government has already given money to schools." Magoha said. He said Sh4 billion had already been released to primary schools and secondary schools received Sh14.6 billion. (Edited by V. Graham)
