Kuwait-based Kenyan make-up artist Stacey Pwitti has advised young people against being used by powerful politicians in their corrupt dealings. Pwitti told Word Is, “I know of people who have been approached by bigwigs. They use you to register a company and ensure it gets tenders." "Once the money comes through, they siphon it out very quickly and give you a little bit of it. However, when investigations start, it's your name which will be on the papers.” Pwitti has worked her way to the top from a mere receptionist, even opening her salon and parlour in Nairobi called Amari. “The other day I had to fire some girls who work in my salon because some of them were stealing from me. Let's build wealth the right way, work hard and get something that will last because easy come, easy go.”
