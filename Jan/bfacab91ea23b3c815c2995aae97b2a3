The Pharmacy and Poisons Board has closed 71 premises for operating illegal pharmacies and herbal clinics in Nairobi and Kajiado counties. In a statement on Friday, Deputy director Dominic Kariuki said 49 people have been arrested and 171 cartons of illegal assorted medicines seized. "The seized medicines will be analyzed and disposed of as per PPB guidelines on disposal of pharmaceutical waste," Kariuki said. The list of closed premises has been shared with county administration and National Police Service for enforcement of closure. During the crackdown, PPB officials obtained invoices, receipts and other documents from the illegal premises. "This is helping us to identify the licensed wholesalers of pharmaceuticals who are supplying these illegal premises. The owners of those wholesalers will be prosecuted and their licenses revoked," he said. Those who were taken to courts were given cash bail of between Sh500,000 to Sh150,000. Those who pleaded guilty were fined up to Sh50,000. Kariuki urged the courts to enhance fines for those found guilty, in line with the fines in the amended Cap 244, to act as a deterrent.
