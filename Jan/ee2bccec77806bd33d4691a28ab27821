During the meeting, Naomi commended the government of Kenya for the improvement of infrastructure at the Coast including the upgrading of Malindi Airport to international standards adding that this will boost tourism in the region. "I am also impressed with the world-class standard facilities at the Professional Golf Association Baobab course located in Vipingo Ridge, the only golf course accredited by the PGA in the whole of Africa. I invite golf professionals globally to visit the course to enjoy the experience," Naomi said. Naomi jetted into the country last year, for the Christmas and New Year holidays. She arrived aboard her luxurious jet and was in the tourist resort town of Malindi for one month. Campbell stayed at the exclusive Lion in the Sun resort owned by her ex-boyfriend and billionaire Flavio Briatore. The international celebrity's visit is a major boost to the tourism sector, which has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
