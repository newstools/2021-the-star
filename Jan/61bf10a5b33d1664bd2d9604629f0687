About 150 children, including 30 Dadaab refugees, have received free eye treatment at the Garissa Referral Hospital. The camp is sponsored by Garissa county, the Somali community in North America, the Kenya Red Cross and the Waso Resource Development Agency (Warda). Procedures started on Sunday and will continue through Thursday. Doctors will return to Dadaab to screen and treat adult patients. The hospital will hold another free eye medical camp for 200 to 300 people across the county next month. Congenital cataracts and other ailments were treated. The team of surgeons and specialists was led by Prof Francis Sempelle and Dr Daniel Greben. Visual impairment has many causes, including uncorrected near or far-sightedness, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, corneal opacity and trachoma. “We are hopeful we will transform the lives of patients and their families," Prof Sempele said. The same surgeries and procedures in eye clinics and hospitals cost Sh30,000 and Sh200,000. Hospital medical superintendent Dr Ambrose Misore praised the camp, saying that despite the nationwide health workers strike, the hospital was able to help many children. “We are able to operate all our main departments including maternity and the theatre. We ask the public to come as we are operating normally," Misore said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
