Sol Generation's Bensoul says part of the inspiration of his hit song 'Nairobi' is very personal. The song, which features Bien, Nviiri and Mejja, has taken Kenya by storm, with many Kenyans relating to the lyrics. Speaking to Mpasho Live, Bensoul said most of his songs are from personal experience. "There is a friend of mine who sent me messages on how he was being played by a lover in broad daylight. I wrote this song as an affirmation that he should not forget we are in Nairobi. And that is where the idea came from." Bensoul was asked if he views Nairobi as a big bedroom. "Yes I do," he said. "It is all about per person sharing. Hata mimi nimechezwa mara mingi, but such is life."
