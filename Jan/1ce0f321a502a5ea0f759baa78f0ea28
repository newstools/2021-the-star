A human rights organisation wants civil registration offices in Garissa county decentralised to save time and money for residents seeking birth certificates. Haki Na Sheria Garissa branch programme officer Khasida Abdullahi Haji said residents in remote areas of the county are forced to travel hundreds of kilometres to Garissa town just to apply for birth certificates. Khasida spoke on Saturday in Saka division, 100km from Garissa town, where they distributed 362 birth certificates to residents. The issuance came after Haki Na Sheria partnered with the civil registration office to conduct a mobile births listing drive in Saka market. “We are here today to issue these certificates. This is a partnership that was meant to assist the poor who cannot afford to travel to Garissa and acquire birth certificates for their children,” she said. Khasida said among those who received the documents were elderly people and schoolchildren. Most of the beneficiaries have been unable to acquire the important document due to lack of funds and or awareness. She urged residents to apply for birth certificates immediately after a child is born to make it easier for them to obtain other important documents such as IDs, passports and to be allowed to sit exams in schools and colleges in the future. Resident Mohamed Salah said they have been experiencing challenges at the registration offices. “The government has said children must have birth certificates for them to enrol in schools, but we have had so many problems accessing these offices. Something should be done urgently to make it easier for citizens to acquire birth certificates,” Mohamed said. Saka residents who received the birth certificates thanked Haki na Sheria for coming to their aid. In Garissa county, only Garissa Township and Masalani have civil registration offices. Although an office was recently opened in Balambala, it has been dogged by a lack of personnel.
