Former Chief Justice David Maraga has condemned corruption within the government and urged governors to take decisive action to end looting of public resources. “I would say embarrassing as it is, it is an acknowledged fact that the country loses one third of the national budget to corruption. The looting of public resources is alarming,” he said on Wednesday. Maraga said every Kenyan should be committed to fighting corruption. “To be fair, I should add that all of us Kenyans are to blame for this. Right from the village kiosks, all of us keep cutting corners to steal from each other," he said. "As a result, after paying salaries and defraying other aspects of recurrent expenditure, there is little left for development. What that boils down to is the stagnation of the growth of the national economy." The former CJ was speaking during a luncheon organised for him by the Council of Governors. Maraga challenged the governors to ensure the formulation of policies on the proper and equitable utilisation of county resources. “As county leaders, you are, in my view, under obligation to have, as your top priority, the anti-corruption crusade. You are, in my view, under obligation to ensure the frugal utilisation of the resources placed in your hands.” The former CJ said all is not lost as some counties have had excellent record of progress whereas there are still reports of misuse of funds that are availed to counties. He urged the governors to put the interests of Kenyans first. “The funds that are availed for service provision are meant to improve the lives and livelihoods of those that you govern. As leaders, we have a direct responsibility to ensure that these resources are put to good use. I implore you to remain faithful to your oath of office and to always put the interests of the people you lead ahead,” Maraga said.
