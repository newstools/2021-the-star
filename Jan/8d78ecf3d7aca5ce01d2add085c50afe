A first-term governor is the talk of constituents after buying a brand new chopper 18 months to the general election. Questions now arise on the source of the millions to acquire the chopper, with MPs from the area saying the governor is not known to engage in any meaningful business outside the county job. Corridors eavesdropped in a conversation where some MPs and the area senator were concerned that county resources have not been used prudently while the governor is swimming in opulence. The lawmakers now want the county assembly to be serious with their oversight role to avoid any misappropriation of public resources. ** Some residents of a prominent town in Kenya now want the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to launch investigations into an ongoing multimillion beautification project in the town. They claim the tender was awarded to a senior politician through a proxy. They say although they welcome the project funded by donors, it would be fair for the anti-graft agency to probe the tendering processes and the owners of the companies undertaking the works, including those involved in the construction of new  modernised  business structures in the area. ** An MP seems to have given up his political interest, claiming the party has settled on his rival for the coming 2022 election. The opposition lawmaker, who was once a loud sycophant of his party and its leader, is reading betrayal after being kept in the dark in important activities by the party boss is his constituency. For instance, the MP claims that he no longer get information when the party leader visits his Constituency and only see things in the media. The troubled MP is now pointing finger at the county boss for his political woes and has shifted his allegiance to another gubernatorial aspirant to teach the incumbent a lesson.
