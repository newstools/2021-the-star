Elizabeth Kinyanjui, the cousin of Kinyanjui Wambaa, the construction worker killed in the Kiambaa murders, has called for help to bury him. Elizabeth on Monday said her cousin's murder has not been given due attention. "I just see my brother being called 'a construction worker, farm hand, casual labourer. He is a human being, a family man," she said. She said the family was appealing for help from well-wishers to foot hospital bills and burial costs. Kinyanjui Wambaa was aged 38 and was father of two. Meanwhile, the prime suspect in the murders will be held in police custody for 14 days to allow investigators to conclude their probe. Lawrence Warunge was presented in Kiambu court on Monday morning when investigators were given two weeks to probe the matter. Police will use the time to do DNA tests and postmortem as part of the investigations. During that period, Warunge will also undergo a mental assessment. An emotionless and calm Warunge was in a pensive mood at the court and when the claims by the prosecution were read to him, he said "no objection". Plans are to conduct an autopsy on the bodies on Monday to establish how the victims died. Warunge was arrested last Friday in Kabete area after he went to seek refuge there while on the run. Police said they arrested him after he went missing since last Tuesday when his parents, two brothers, and the farmhand were murdered at their home in Kiambaa Constituency, Kiambu county. After his arrest, he confessed to the incident and led police to a residence in Mai Mahiu area on Saturday where they recovered the killer weapon- a kitchen knife, pieces of clothing, shoes, and a piece of paper. He had thrown the exhibits in a pit latrine. Police dug the wall of the latrine and used ropes to recover the exhibits from the 20 feet deep pit. He also took police to an open field in the same area where he said he burnt some of the evidence.
