Pre-exam unrest in secondary schools persisted on Thursday when the government closed down Naivasha High School after arson in a dormitory. The students on Thursday morning burnt part of their personal effects in another case of arson leading to the closure of the school. More than 500 students were sent home after the early morning blaze. Trouble started on Wednesday morning when Form 4 students had a fistfight with Form 3 students, leaving scores injured. The cause of the fight was not immediately known. All the Form 4s were sent home and police were deployed but a fire was set in a dorm early on Thursday. Naivasha subcounty commissioner Mutua Kisilu said no one was injured and only personal effects were damaged. “Police are questioning some of the students while the school has been closed down,” he said. Meanwhile, the number of victims who have died while illegally fishing around Lake Naivasha continued to rise after another man was electrocuted as he left the water. He touched a live wire on a farm submerged by flooding. He died on the spot on Thursday morning near South Lake where illegal fishing has increased. At least eight people have drowned, killed by wild animals or died in other ways around the lake since the year began. Fisherman Joseph Waithaka said youths were leaving the lake after illegal fishing when one was electrocuted after he touched a submerged live wire on a flooded farm. “We are worried by the rising cases of deaths around the lake mainly involving very young people who are out to seek daily bread,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said the body had been taken to a mortuary. Early in the month, two teenagers, including a first-year university student. drowned in the lake while fishing illegally near Karagita landing beach. (Edited by V. Graham)
