Seventeen public schools in the Rift Valley have not reopened due to flooding and vandalism. Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya said 16 of the affected schools were flooded in Baringo county while one was vandalised in Mariashoni, Nakuru county. Natembeya said residents demolished the school when the government was evicting squatters in Upper Eastern Mau. The schools in Baringo failed to reopen because of the overflowing Lake Baringo. "However, we cannot entirely say that the schools have not opened because the learners have been relocated to higher grounds," he said. The administrator who was accompanied by senior officials from the Ministry of Education said the learners in Mariashoni were accommodated in the neighbouring Daraja Primary School. "They are not congested at Daraja because a section of the community moved out of the area with their children,"Â  Natembeya said. Natembeya said 74 per cent of the 3,080 private schools in the region had also reopened. A spot check in most of the schools revealed that 100 per cent of the learners had masks, he said. "Most of the schools had water points for hand washing and those without water supply will be considered for sinking of boreholes," he said. More than 5,000 girls were impregnated in the region during the closure of schools. Natembeya urged the schools to account for all learners in their registers before Covid-19 to prevent dropouts. It is government policy that girls who have delivered must be readmitted to school. "Those in early pregnancy should continue education as they await delivery," he added. He warned parents against forcing their children into early marriages simply because they got pregnant. Edited by Henry Makori
