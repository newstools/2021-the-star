Anerlisa Muigai has officially acquired Ben Pol’s last name months after their private nuptials. Anerlisa has now changed her official names to 'Anerlisa Muigai Mnyang'anga'. In a recent interview with Mwanaspoti, the couple said they wedded in May last year in the leafy suburbs of Mbezi, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. "Our close friends and family knew about the wedding. Na hata baada ya kanisani tulijumuika nao kwa ajili ya chakula na vitu vingine. Sisi tunadhani ndoa ni kitu cha kifamilia ziadi." During the interview, Anerlisa clarified that they have never broken up, contrary to speculations that went viral last year. The speculation started after Anerlisa unfollowed Ben Pol and deleted all photos she had on her profile with him, including those of their engagement, photos of Ben Pol meeting her parents and other cute photos of them together. She later hinted she was not in good terms with her husband after he went live on Instagram. "Somebody called me, asking if I was aware 'my husband' was live, talking things she couldn’t understand, she even sent me screenshots," she wrote. "Unfortunately, I never got to watch but it makes it clear that we are not in good terms. I am a person who likes to protect my image and all I know is that I like being respected and any husband should do the same to their wife." Anerlisa now said that all that was not true. "Haikuwa kweli, lakini hata hivyo sisi huwa hatuweki umakini kwenye maneno ya namna hiyo. Yakisemwa tunaacha yasemwe, hata hatusikilizi, hatujawahi kuachana wala kupeana likizo hata siku moja tangu tuanze mahusiano," she said. "Yale yalikuwa ni maneno ya kutengenezwa na watu wasiotujua vizuri wala mahusiano yetu." Asked on plans to have kids, Anerlisa said she has always wanted to have three children and after a discussion with her husband, they have settled on having three.
