Morans camp got a huge boost when centre Tom Wamukota joined the team ahead of next month’s Fiba Africa Afro-Basket qualifiers in Yaounde, Cameroon from February 17-21. An elated assistant coach Sadat Gaya confirmed the towering Wamukota, who missed the Kigali qualifier in November, is in town. “Yes he landed this morning and he was in practice tonight (Wednesday). We now expect USA-based Ronnie Gundo to join us before the end of the week,” Gaya said. The 7-foot centre, who was held up in DR Congo during the first window, will be key to Kenya’s chances in the make or break fixture. He will play a key role in Kenya’s chances during the crucial second window set for February 17-21. “Bush is an athletic 7-footer. He brings something you don’t see everyday—height and athleticism,” said Gaya. He went on, “He brings leadership in practice and in games.” Gaya said he is also an excellent re-bounder and shot blocker, who can move his feet and will do anything to help the team win. Wamukota, who ignited the crowd during the pre qualifiers against South Sudan last January, plays for Rwandese champions Patriots. He is the team’s main stay alongside Australia-based Desmond Owili, who has now fully recovered from an injury he sustained in Kigali. With the two centres working in tandem, Gaya said Kenya now has two of it’s best players shaping up for duty in that vital position. He said the team is gearing up well with majority of the local-based players already in camp. Kenya are targeting a return to the championship after a 27-year hiatus. Morans open their Group B fixture on February 19 with a match against group leaders Senegal. They play Angola the following day before meeting Mozambique. The other qualifier will be held in Monatsir, Tunisia and 16 teams will book their ticket to the continental festival in Kigali in August.
