Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has finally been coronated by Talai elders in Kabarak as a Kalenjin elder in a ceremony that took three hours at dawn. The elaborate ceremony started at 4 a.m. The event was planned secretly after a similar event flopped earlier this month. On January 2 youth blocked Gideon Moi from accessing the home of an elder for the same ceremony. The installation of Gideon Moi now puts him at political loggerheads with Deputy President William Ruto who had undergone a similar ceremony done by a different group of Talai elders. Gideon's installation was done by elders led by Christopher Koyogi. Koyogi had vowed that the ceremony would go on after it was blocked by youth. Koyogi declared that Gideon was now the Kalenjin community leader and he was given similar powers as those given to his father more than 63 years ago. The elders handed Gideon the Kalenjin community's instruments of power and gave him the mandate to look for the country's leadership. Gideon later flew to Rumuruti for a BBI event.
