Ten police officers were on Saturday injured by angry bullfighting fans at Malinya area of Ikolomani sub-county. The officers including operation commander George Opere sustained injuries on the rib cage, mouth, shoulders, back, head, legs and hands after being hit with stones and clubs. They were treated at the Shibwe level 4 hospital and discharged. No casualties were reported among the public. Four police vehicles were also damaged during the confrontation between police and the bullfighters. A contingent of 60 officers drawn from Malaika police station and neighbouring Mumias West, Navakholo and Kakamega North sub-counties had raided the Malinya stadium to disperse a gathering during a bullfighting match for contravening the Covid-19 protocols. Police say the gathering had not been authorized as required by the Covid-19 safety requirements. On arrival, the bullfighters charged at the officers and started pelting them with stones. The officers responded by lobbing teargas canisters in the angry crowds as they fired in the air. According to a police report, the officers used 70 teargas canisters and over 100 rounds of blank bullets to disperse the crowds. Police accused owners of the bulls Geoffrey Matioli and Petro Njomu of inviting their fans to attack them without provocation. Bullfighting which attracts huge crowds that turn rowdy on the slightest provocation, isÂ a popular sport in Kakamega county, especially in Ikolomani, Shinyalu and Lurambi sub-counties Bull owners request for bouts with others at a fee that ranges between Sh 5, 000 and Sh 15, 000. Former Kakamega senator Boni Khallwale who is an ardent supporter of bullfighting, pushed for the establishment of the stadium during his tenure as area MP to promote it.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
