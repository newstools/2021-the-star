Kenyan Trade Unionist Francis Atwoli has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to take control and charge of the Jubilee Party. Atwoli urged the President to "crack the whip" in Jubilee or else he will be on the losing end in the next general election. The Cotu boss who spoke on Saturday during the funeral of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi's mother Hannah, said Uhuru should stand up for his supporters in Jubilee who are being attacked. "We want to support you because of the stability of the country. Come out and help us crack the whip and maintain discipline," Atwoli said. "Even people who are dying with you like Peter Kenneth have been declared illegal immigrants in their homestead and you are there. Protect your lieutenants. Toka Nje!" "Your Excellency I want you to be serious the way your dad used to be and protect your lieutenants ndio utuwachie amani…Please crack the whip. Hii Ngozi nyeusi usipochunga you will find them in your bedroom,” Atwoli said. Atwoli further criticized Deputy President William Ruto for purporting that the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) had stagnated Uhuru's Big Four Agenda. "He knows the two important projects are both your projects. He claims to be your deputy. Does Jubilee not have a clause to expel people. Which party is that?" Atwoli said, leaving mourners in stitches. Atwoli implied that Ruto will turn his back on his supporters when he ascends to power. "I see Moses Kuria is here... when William Ruto will become the President you will be the first prisoner," he said.
