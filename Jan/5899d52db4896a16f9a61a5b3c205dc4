A sacked pastor is being held for allegedly slitting his wife's throat on Thursday night. County police commander Jebel Munene said Joel Mogaka, 40, took the body of his wife Irene Nyakwara to the mortuary and said she took poison. Police have picked him up for interrogation. "We have already begun investigations and already have credible clues," Munene said. Nyakwara was a teacher at Bombaba Secondary School in Magena. Her husband was sacked from the Seventh-day Adventist South Kenya Conference several years ago and ventured into farming. Neighbours at Omosasa in Bomachoge Borabu told journalists their marriage was troubled and they quarrelled often. They said on Thursday night Mogaka picked a quarrel with Nyakwara over SMSs from another man on her phone which led to a fight and the killing. "They had been...accusations and counter-accusations of infidelity. There had been attempts by elders to iron out the issue but in vain," Tim Kironchi said. The SMSs were allegedly sent by an officer based at Magena police station. Detectives took the phone. Police said they are investigating whether Mokaya had accomplices. Police found blood spots in the couple's maize store where they suspect the killing took place. A cloth with blood stains was also at the scene. The bodyÂ  is at Christamarriane Catholic Mission Mortuary in Kisii awaiting postmortem.
