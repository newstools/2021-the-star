Award-winning Kenyan Hollywood actress Lupita Nyong’o has laughed off claims that Kenya has been looking for her for five years. Tourism CS Najib Balala said this after he was forced to defend the recent appointment of supermodel Naomi Campbell as Magical Kenya’s international ambassador instead of Lupita. Balala told the Nation that his ministry had unsuccessfully tried to get in touch with Lupita for five years now. “I know everybody is asking why not Lupita. Lupita has commitments and her managers cannot allow us to access her. We’ve spent the last five years looking for Lupita,” Balala said as quoted by the Nation. But on Friday, Lupita posted a picture of her heartily laughing at those claims made by Balala. "Me when I hear the Kenyan Ministry of Tourism has been looking for me for fives years. #Imrightherebaby #alternativefacts," she said in a tweet. Her comment attracted mixed reactions from all over the world. Here are some of the comments;
