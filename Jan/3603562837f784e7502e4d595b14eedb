UK has extended its restrictions on citizens allowed into the country to curb the spread of Covid-19. Rwanda, Burundi and the UAE are among the latest countries to be added to the 'red list'. "From Friday, January 29, we’re extending our travel ban with the United Arab Emirates, Burundi and Rwanda all added to the UK's red list," the UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps said. This means people who have been in or transited through the banned countries will be denied entry, except British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights who must self-isolate for 10 days at home. "Passengers must still have proof of a negative test and completed Passenger Locator Form before arrival – or could otherwise face a £500 fine for each," he added. Countries that have been banned include Angola, Argentina, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burundi, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Guyana, French Guiana, Eswatini, Ecudor, DRC among others. The prevalence of COVID-19 infections in England remains high, the Office for National Statistics said in its weekly infection survey on Friday, finding that current levels of coronavirus cases had plateaued but are not falling. According to Reuters, the ONS said that around 1 in 55 people had COVID-19 in the week ending January 23, the same prevalence as reported the previous week.
