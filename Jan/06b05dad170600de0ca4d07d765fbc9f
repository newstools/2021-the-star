A man who raided his uncle's house and robbed him of Sh130,000 at gunpoint has been charged at a Makadara law court. Masudi Juma was accused of violently robbing George Okoth of the cash, a laptop worth Sh30,000 and an Infinix phone worth Sh12,000 at Cieko area in Kasarani subcounty on January 14. Juma is also faced with an alternative count of being in possession of suspected stolen property. The court heard that the accused on January 19 at Baba Dogo area within Ruaraka, besides stealing, was found in possession of phones believed to have been stolen. He pleaded not guilty before Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyaga. According to the police report, Juma in the company of two men went to his uncle's place at around 7pm. The two men drew a pistol and ordered all occupants in the house to lie down on their stomachs. The accused ordered his uncle to pay him his debt of Sh13,000 or they shoot him. They proceeded to ransack the house and took valuables plus cash that was in the bag before they took off on a motorcycle. The accused was later arrested at Baba Dogo after officers from Kasarani police station got a tip-off from members of the public. He led the officers to a house within Ruaraka where the stolen property was recovered. Nyaga freed Juma on a bond of Sh500,000. The matter will be mentioned on February 4. Edited by Henry Makori
