The Kenya Airports Authority has announced plans to refurbish Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. In a statement on Thursday, the authority said that the renovation is meant to improve the passenger experience at the airport. The renovation will be carried out at the airport’s Terminals 1B and 1C. The 12-month airport development project is estimated to cost Sh963 million, aiming to refurbish the departure halls to improve the check-in, security screening, retail operations, and passenger lounge experience. The authority said that once completed, the newly renovated light-filled departure terminals will deliver modern concessions as well as amenities that will give travelers a friendly experience. According to KAA Acting CEO Alex Gitari, the refurbishment and facelift of the T1B and 1C aim to align the passenger experience in terminals to watch what is being offered at T1A. “The remodeling project is an integral part of the ongoing JKIA Customers Service Improvement Plan (CSIP) which was formulated from feedback from our stakeholders and customers,” Gitari said. Following the implementation of the project, airlines that have been operating from terminal 1B and 1C are being temporarily relocated to Terminal 1A and Terminal 2. To minimse inconveniences, passengers have been requested to arrive at the airport at least 4 hours before their flight departures.
