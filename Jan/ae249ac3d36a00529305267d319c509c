The search for two students is ongoing after they sneaked out of school four days ago in Kitui. The two - a boy and a girl- Â from a local mixed day and boarding secondary school are in form one and two respectively. DCI boss George Kinoti said the girl's younger sister who is a form one student at the same school had on Friday informed her mother that she had seen her sibling leave the school compound with a form one boy, a day-scholar. On Saturday morning, the mother went to the school and verified the information. "She went to the boy's home but the two were nowhere to be found," Kinoti added. Investigations to trace the missing students aged 18 and 16 years have been instituted. Anybody with information should Call 0800 722 203 to speak anonymously to the DCI anytime.
