Kenya's ruling Jubilee Party has congratulated US President Joe Biden after his inauguration on January 20. "Heartfelt congratulations to President @JoeBiden following his inauguration as the 46th President of the USA, and to Vice President @KamalaHarris, who has made history by becoming the first woman to hold the office of the Vice President in America," Jubilee said in a tweet. In a statement on Thursday, the party said their ascension into office is an inspiring testimony of the unrelenting resilience of hope. "...This is an inspiring testimony to the healing power of unity and the ultimate triumph of democracy over the destructive impulses that had threatened to tear apart the heart of American democracy," the party said. Biden was sworn in as President of the United States on Wednesday, vowing to end the 'uncivil war' in a deeply divided country reeling from a battered economy and a raging coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 Americans. With his hand on a five-inch thick heirloom Bible that has been in his family for more than a century, Biden took the oath of office administered by US Chief Justice John Roberts that binds the president to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." "Through a crucible for the ages, America has been tested anew, and America has risen to the challenge," Biden said in his inaugural address. "Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause: the cause of democracy...At this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed."
