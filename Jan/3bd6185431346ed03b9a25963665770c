A case in which a police officer is charged with the murder of 13-year-old Yassin Moyo will be mentioned on February 23. The matter had been listed for mentioning on Tuesday, but did not proceed as the court file was not with the presiding judge Daniel Ogola. In the case, Duncan Ndiema was charged before Justice Luka Kimaru on June 23 last year with the murder of Yassin. He denied the charges. He was released on a Sh1 million cash bail on condition he does not interfere with witnesses. Justice Kimaru also ordered Ndiema to provide two contacts who had to be close relatives and not set foot near Huruma police station. The state had opposed his release on bail, arguing that Yassin’s family has received threats and intimidation from persons believed to be Ndiema’s agents or proxies. The prosecution told the court that if Ndiema is released on bail pending trial before witnesses evidence is secured, he was likely to intimidate them. At the time of the incident and his subsequent arrest there was tension in the community, with a heightened animosity towards the police. Ndiema was in uniform when he committed the crime in March last year. He also had an Israeli pistol serial number 44338354 loaded with 10 rounds of ammunition.
