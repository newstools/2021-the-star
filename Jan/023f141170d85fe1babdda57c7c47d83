Senate Majority Chief Whip Irungu Kangata has stuck to his guns that BBI is unpopular in Mt Kenya region adding that he does not mind if his strong views will cost him his seat. Addressing journalists at Parliament Buildings on Monday, Kangata said BBI is facing 'systematic political problems' in Mt Kenya that need to be addressed to save the government from 'embarrassment' And in what could worsen his woes in Jubilee and widen the rift with President Uhuru Kenyatta, Kangata has sided with Deputy President William Ruto's call for a multiple-choice referendum to save BBI from total rejection. The Murang'a Senator, however, said he wrote the letter to President Kenyatta in good faith and reiterated his loyalty to the President despite Uhuru's outburst about his letter. He said he will continue to support the Jubilee Government but was ready to leave his current position of Chief Whip if the party opts to oust him on the basis of his letter. Kangata said the perception that BBI was being pushed by a faction of the Jubilee Party and use of provincial administration to advance it has made the drive unmarketable in the region. He insisted that he made the observation after meeting locals, opinion leaders and professionals from Murang'a who expressed their reservation about the BBI. He maintained that he has the obligation to tell the government the truth and hit out at National Assembly Majority Amos Kimunya for attacking him and not telling the President the truth. Kangata evaded the question on whether he was planning to ditch the President's faction for Ruto's saying that he is a whip for Jubilee Party and does not believe in 'factional' leadership.
