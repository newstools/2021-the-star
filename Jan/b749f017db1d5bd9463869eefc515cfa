ODM Raila Odinga on Monday appeared to back President Uhuru Kenyatta's call to have another community produce the country's next head of state. Speaking at his Karen residence after meeting 'Team One Kenya' led by Maina Njenga, the former PM termed the issue of rotational presidency sensitive in Kenya but a practice that is being done by other countries. "We must be differentiated based on ideology, not ethnicity. No one chose to be in the tribe they are in, that was a biological accident," he said. Raila called on a much representative government citing the 2013 Jubilee administration which he said did not reflect the face of the nation. "Understand that each and every Kenyan pays taxes. Taxes are collected in all regions of this country without discrimination," Raila said. "Therefore, don't discriminate. When it comes to making an appointment to position this country. Look at each and every person, as a Kenyan." Uhuru on Saturday gave the clearest hint he may not back his deputy William Ruto for the presidency and may in fact campaign against him. Uhuru said Mt Kenya and the Kalenjin communities have produced the country’s four presidents since Independence and should pave the way other communities. “Even me, I can stand here and say there are only two Kenyan communities that have led. Maybe it's time for other tribes to lead. Kenya has many communities,” Uhuru said, getting a standing ovation from sections of the mourners. But Ruto on Sunday said the next head of state will be elected on their policies and not based on their ethnicity. In a jibe at the handshake team, he said some are waiting to be given the presidency in boardrooms and bars.
