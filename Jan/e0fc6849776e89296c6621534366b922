Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has called upon security officials to get children who are not yet back to school and have them in school. The CS spoke at Nyambaria Boys School where he was assessing the state of school a few days after reopening. Matiang'i was with Health PS Susan Mochache, County Commissioner Amos Mariba, Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose, Principal Boaz Owino, and Nyamira Woman representative Jerusha Momanyi. Matiang'i insisted that all children must be in school without any hindrance, and cautioned any school head against sending students home for school fees. "Let the children be in school first and as government we will handle the rest. Let us give peace of mind to our children to study," the security boss said. Matiang'i however noted with a lot of concern, the missing 61 student from the school (Nyambaria) where he called the school principal and the county security team to ensure the missing student are back with immediate effect. "It is worrying that in a school with more than 2000 students, we can have some students absent, but I am calling upon security officials to ensure they come back to school because they are required to be in school," the CS said.
