Kenya will bid to host the Davis Euro-Africa Group 3 tournament later in the year. Tennis Kenya secretary General Wanjiku Mbugua Karani said the federation has already sent bid documents to the International Tennis Federation(ITF). Kenya, however, faces competition from Egypt for the week-long extravaganza. The North Africans, who were relegated from the Euro-Africa Group 2 after finishing bottom of their pool are keen on hosting the event. The ITF will announce the winning bid between the two countries next month and Karani expressed confidence that the country will get the nod to host the biggest tennis event of the year. "We have a good chance of hosting the event. We have hosted a couple of local events, since tennis was given the green light to resume by the Ministry of Sports, which puts us in a good position to host the tournament,” observed Mbugua Should Kenya win the bid, they will host the tournament in June and will be seeking to be promoted to Group 2 after losing to Indonesia 5-0 in the playoffs in Jakarta last year. Teams expected for the Euro-Africa Group 3 are Algeria, Benin, Ghana, Madagascar, Mozambique, Rwanda and Egypt. Mbugua said hosting the event will give Kenyan players the advantage of playing at home (Nairobi Club) "Our players are familiar with the surface and it will give us a good chance of getting promoted to Group 2,” said Mbugua, adding that they are ready to host more events this year. “We are looking at hosting more tournaments this year to keep the players fit and competitive. We are also following all the Covid-19 protocols."
