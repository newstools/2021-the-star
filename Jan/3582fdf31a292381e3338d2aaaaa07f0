The man’s body dangled from a rope tied to the rafters of an incomplete building but he still tightly held a torch in his right hand. That fact has baffled residents of Mwivona village in Lugari subcounty. The body of Patrick Lukungu, 30, was discovered by a woman who had gone to draw water from Lumakanda stream on Tuesday morning. “I had just filled the bucket with water and as I lifted it to put it on my head, I saw what appeared to be somebody standing inside a house that was under construction across the stream. I greeted him but he didn’t respond. On looking carefully, I saw a rope in his neck hanging from the rafters,” Pamela Wanakacha said. She crossed over the stream and informed the family of the incident. Wanakacha is a resident of Bondeni village in Munyuki sub-location Lukungu’s father, Daniel Makokha, was distraught at his son’s death. They had spent the previous day together working on the house. “We spent the day here constructing this house, which I had decided to put up for him. He never told me if there was anything disturbing him and we parted at about 9pm when he went to sleep. I received the shocking news of his death today morning,” Makokha said. He wondered how his dead son maintained a firm grip of the torch in his hand. Officers from Lumakanda police station transferred the body to Kimbilio mortuary. They have begun investigations into the incident. Marakusi assistant chief Edith Ayodi called for better mechanisms to solve family disputes. “We know there so many challenges in life that can lead to depression but it’s good to share your problems so that you can be assisted through guidance and counselling other than resorting to suicide,” Ayodi said.
