Fast-rising star B Classic, alias 006, has released 'Nakuja' featuring Sanaipei Tande. Speaking about the song, B Classic told Word Is, "Nakuja is the passion one feels when youâ€™re around that one person and wishing you could talk, act differently. "The song is about how the nerves often take over the conversations, how I want to come and take this pretty lady to see my boss because she is my everything." Born in Taveta, B Classic was raised by a Somali woman who took him in after being neglected by his mother at a tender age. The Champion Studios signee is set to release six collaborations in the coming months, featuring local and international acts, and an EP towards the end of the year.
