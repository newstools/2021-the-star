As the 2022 polls draw near, three women leaders are expected to be among those who will be battling for the Kirinyaga governor's seat. They are Narc leader Martha Karua, Woman Representative Wangui Ngirichi and Governor Anne Waiguru. Last week, Karua said she would seek Narc Kenya's ticket during the party's nominations. “I’m asking those interested to come out and compete with me. Should I lose to any of them, I’m ready to respect the party members’ decision by supporting and campaigning for the preferred candidate,” she said. This is the second time she is expressing interest in the seat. The first time was in 2017, but she lost to Waiguru. Karua has been meeting party delegates in the county in a move to popularise the outfit, which she said would be fronting candidates in various political posts in the county and the country at large. She advised residents to scrutinise the financial accountability of all candidates who will reach out to them, expressing interest in re-election and those seeking to unseat incumbents. “Hold all leaders to account over how they use their positions. Let them explain to you how they have used public funds. As long as you have good leaders at the national level and bad ones at the county level, you will forever wallow in poverty.” Waiguru, who is expected to defend her seat, has announced that she will visit churches in the county and talk to people about her development record. Late last week, she said her flagship projects were on course, and she is committed to delivering what she promised residents during 2017 campaigns. Her tenancy  in the Kutus-based office has been marred by a political stand-offs between her administration and the county assembly members. The MCAs sought to impeach her, but she was saved by the Senate. Ngirichi has been marketing her bid to clinch the top seat.
