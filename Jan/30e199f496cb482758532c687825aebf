The Tax Appeals Tribunal has held that former Nairobi Finance chief officer Jimmy  Kiamba owes the Commissioner of Domestic Taxes Sh33 million. In March 2020, Tribunal chairperson Moses Obonyo stated that Kiamba owed Sh33,841, 991,000 and not Sh402 million contained in a review application by the  Commissioner for Investigations and Enforcement. The amount is payable for the period 2007 to 2014. Obonyo's decision has been upheld by Eric Wafula, who chaired the tribunal hearing the review of the first judgment. He dismissed the review application. “The tax payable for the period of 2007 to 2013 is assessed at Sh33,841,991,00,” the tribunal said. Wafula in his ruling dated December 11, 2020, said the additional Sh800 million contained in the review application was not properly assessed. He said the appellant (Kiamba), in the view of Obonyo’s judgment, went on and paid the Sh33 million to the Commissioner of Income Tax.
