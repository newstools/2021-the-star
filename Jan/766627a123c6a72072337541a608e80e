Senator Irungu Kang'ata has maintained that he will not recant his letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta inwhich he outlined a list of reasons why he felt BBI is unpopular in Central Kenya. Kang'ata said emissaries have been sent to try and convince him to either resign or recant his statements. "I have told them in clear terms that I will not recant that letter. Reason being it was factual. I was only reporting information that I gathered in Murang'a county which appears to reflect also the general sentiments in our region," Kang'ata said in an interview with the Nation on Thursday. Kang'ata wrote a controversial letter to Uhuru indicating that the BBI referendum was not popular in the Central region. He warned that as a result, the proposed BBI referendum faces a "spectacular defeat" in the region. The letter which triggered political suspicion, also rocked a major split in his Mt Kenya backyard. Though Kang'ata apologised, saying the letter was leaked to the media, Uhuru's allies have claimed Deputy President William Ruto is the hand behind the political turmoilâ€”including the letter. On Monday Kang'ata was disowned by powerful Mt Kenya leaders, including the region's 10 governors. However, he still maintains that the letter was courteous and he did not insult anyone. When asked whether he will resign, Kang'ata said he will not resign due to pressure but if he finds a probable reason. "I'm a leader who does not believe in clinging strongly onto power. I do not want a position where he is embarrassed by the people from his backyard," he said. "I will not resign pursuant to pressure. But I can tell you if I get a good reason which will then justify my resignation I will definitely resign."
