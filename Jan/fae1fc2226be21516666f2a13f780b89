The Kwale county government has distributed 100 Galla goats to Kinango farmers to improve livestock farming. The main source of livelihood for the Kinango people is animal rearing and food crop farming. Galla goats are known for their high quality milk and meat and resilience to harsh climatic conditions and diseases unlike other breeds. Governor Salim Mvurya said the county intends to empower local small scale farmers to produce high quality yields for a competitive market. He said soon the multimillion Kombani fresh produce wholesale market will be ready, hence the need to equip farmers with the necessary means to effectively take advantage of the market opportunities. “Once the market is ready it will require more supplies locally for its steady operation. That’s why we are assisting in capacity building and preparing them ahead of its grand opening,” he said. The market is expected to open its doors to more than 6,000 farmers and 1,000 traders this year. The governor said the hybrid goats will fetch better profits for the farmers that will in turn spur county economic growth and uplift their living standards. Mvurya said the county has already put some measures by making dams to boost agricultural activities, improve the road network and industrialisation. “We have the Shimba Hills fruit processing plant, modern slaughterhouses, mega-dams, tarmacked Samburu-Kinango, Kanana-Shimoni and Lunga-Lunga roads,” he said. The governor said his government is empowering farmers by offering them free seedlings, fertiliser and ploughing services to boost food security. He said the roads will provide easy market access for both locals and international traders who will be using the highways. “The surplus food will be transported to the market via the good roads, also travellers will drop by to buy one or more things,” he said. Mvurya urged the locals to take good care of the goats so that they can benefit and serve the intended purpose. Edited by Henry Makori
