The Kenya Revenue Authority has released guidelines outlining the applicable corporation tax rates for the years of income 2020 and 2021. The guidelines will be used by corporations whose accounting periods ended in the Year of Income 2020 or are due to end in the Year of Income 2021. The lower rate of 25 per cent was introduced in April 2020 as tax relief to counter the negative effects of Covid-19 on business and employment incomes. In a notice published by KRA Commissioner for Domestic Taxes Rispah Simiyu, resident corporates with accounting periods ending on or before March 30, 2020, have been advised to apply the 30 per cent rate. However, such corporates will enjoy a reduced Covid relief rate of 25 per cent for the income generated in the period April 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. For income earned in the period on or after 1st January, the applicable rate is 30 per cent. “Taxpayers whose accounting period ends after 1st January 2021, shall determine the income for the accounting period and apportion the same between the two periods and charge the applicable rates,” Simiyu said. "....the process of enhancement of the iTax System is already underway to incorporate this interpretation.” She said that taxpayers should prepare their accounts, submit returns through the current iTax system and pay the correct amount of tax in the intervening period. "...any erroneous penalties or interest that may arise’ in the intervening period “shall be corrected when the system is fully deployed,” she said. KRA’s guidelines are expected to clarify Corporation Tax rate changes introduced through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act published on 25th April 2020 and the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act No. 2 of 2020 published on 24th December 2020, which provided for resident corporation tax rates of 25 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Last December, Corporation Tax recorded a performance rate of 93.5 per cent against the target. The performance was negatively affected by a decline in instalment remittance from banks by 25.3 per cent which reflects the impact of Covid on business performance.
