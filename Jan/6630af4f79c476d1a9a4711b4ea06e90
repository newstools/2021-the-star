ODM leader Raila Odinga's address at Githurai was on Wednesday interrupted by youths chanting 'hustler' slogans. The 'hustler' slogan is synonymous with Deputy President William Ruto's supporters. Raila has been on a campaign blitz to popularise BBI as it heads to the county assemblies after the electoral agency on Tuesday confirmed more than one million signatures had been verified as supporting the bill. In Githurai, there was heavy police presence and the youths were pushed back by pro -Raila youths. The hustler group resorted to throwing stones at Raila's convoy and continued chanting 'Ruto and hustler' about 50 meters from where the opposition chief was addressing supporters. Police lobbed teargas cannisters at the youths to disperse them as they attempted to charge towards where Raila was addressing the crowd. Raila's chase car's windscreen was smashed by the youths. During his address, the ODM leader said, "Kila Mkenya ako na haki ya kuishi na kufanya kazi mahali popote nchini (Every Kenyan has the right to live and work wherever they wish in this country." "We will not relent on our resolve to build a peaceful and stable country." Ruto has called for a multiple-choice referendum for BBI, saying Kenyans should be able to choose what they agree with and what they don't. He has also said that his focus is on development, not campaigning for BBI. On Monday, Raila cautioned Mt Kenya residents that they risk losing a lifetime opportunity if they are persuaded to reject changes envisioned in the BBI referendum. Raila, President Uhuru Kenyatta's political buddy, said there may never be another opportunity for the region to negotiate for the kind of goodies contained in the report. “Bahati haipigi hodi mara mbili (Good luck doesn’t knock twice). Opportunities have wings; if not taken, they fly away,” Raila said in an interview with Kameme TV.
