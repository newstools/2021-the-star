Nyamira governor Amos Nyaribo has nominated former West Mugirango MP James Gesami as his deputy. The entire morning, Nyaribo was holed in a meeting with two main contenders of the position who are ODM greats from Nyamira. Nyaribo had narrowed down to Gesami and former Kitutu Masaba MP and ODM Treasurer Timothy Bosire. Until midday Wednesday, the two were in consultation at Nyariboâ€™s residence. On Tuesday, Nyaribo met with Raila and Council of Governors and ODM chairman Wycliffe Oparanya at Raila's home in Karen. ODM had demanded that Nyaribo appoint a party member as his deputy. Nyaribo is an Amani National Congress life member and he had entered into a coalition agreement with his predecessor John Nyagarama whom he succeeded a week ago following his death. After the nomination, the County Assembly will be expected to ratify the choice.
