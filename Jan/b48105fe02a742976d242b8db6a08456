Marini CEO Michelle Ntalami has always stirred a discussion online over her strong friendship with media personality Makena. In a Q&A session on Instagram, Michelle opened an avenue for her followers to ask her anything. One asked her, "Do you get attention from both men and women, and if so, who do you prefer?" She responded, "Hahaha ðŸ˜‚ This question cracked me up. Attention from both men and women, yes. What do I prefer? Men. Case closed." In a previous interview on Kiss100 YouTube page, she said they are friends. "She is an amazing friend. One of the few genuine people I have come across. Very real, very soulful. She has had my back. As young as she is, she tells people f*** off." The two have been pampering each other with love online. In December, Makena, whoâ€™s known for penning love messages to her BFF, shared yet another heartwarming letter, sharing photos of them in Diani. Makena shared a romantic letter appreciating her BFF for the joy and love she brings to her life. Edited by T Jalio
