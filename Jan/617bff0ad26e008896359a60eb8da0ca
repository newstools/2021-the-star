Tanasha Donna and Diamond reunited in Tanzania after nearly a year apart, and almost immediately, went out for a night of fun. The two performed 'Jeje' on stage at a club, and a moment was captured where the Bongo star appeared to ignore Tanasha's kiss. A short video has emerged in which Tanasha is seemingly going in for a kiss, only for Diamond to turn away. A fan talked to her about the snub on Instagram. TilesMombasa said, "Eti alikunyima kiss, Acheni kukuza mambo wakati tunamacho na tunaona. ss wakenya mbona tunachukiana hiv aki? U can see clearly kwamba hakutaka kumkiss alitaka kumwambia ktu, na Mondi kageuka haraka hakumuona. Never mind them, wanakuonea wivu tu." Tanasha responded, "It is what it is. Let them have fun recreating the whole scenario."
