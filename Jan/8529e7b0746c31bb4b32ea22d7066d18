More than 10,000 students from private schools have been absorbed by public facilities, Education CS George Magoha has said. This follows the closure of some private institutions following the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic among other reasons. Magoha on Wednesday said, "Don’t you think the government is doing what it should to our beloved children? Including a medical scheme for all children in secondary school covered by NHIF at Sh4 billion. Give credit to government where it’s deserved." By Tuesday, 80 per cent of learners had reported back to school. Coast and Northeastern regions recorded low student reporting rates. Magoha said those still at home should be persuaded to go back to school. Schools were reopened for face-to-face learning in all classes on Monday after a nine-month closure due to Covid-19. Meanwhile, no child will receive the much anticipated Covid-19 vaccine once it is available in the country, the health ministry has said. Health CAS Mercy Mwangangi said that the two approved vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna were not tested on children in the trial phase thus are only eligible for adult use. Mwangangi also noted that the children would not be considered as among the first to get the vaccine even if the y were eligible as they are not within the category of those classified as highly vulnerable. She further revealed that the country has ordered 24 million vaccine doses. The doses, the health ministry says, will be distributed first to the frontline workers and those in the vulnerable bracket.
