AIC Kasina church in Mlolongo, Machakos county, was on Sunday fumigated minutes before Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka visited. Former Kibwezi West MP Kalembe Ndile and a host of Wiper MCAs from Machakos county assembly also attended. The Wiper party brigade is expected to launch a political campaign to popularise its Senator candidate Agnes Kavindu after the service. A rally has been planned at Athi River town within Mavoko constituency. The Wiper candidate will be facing off at the ballot with several aspirants including Albanus Muthama Ngengele (UDA), John Mutua Katuku (Maendeleo Chap Chap), Simeon Kitheka (GNDP), Lilian Nduku Mwanzia (CCU), among others. Kavindu's nomination by the Wiper party was met with mixed reactions among electorate and several politicians not only from Machakos county but across the Ukambani region with some claiming Kalonzo is using Kavindu to settle political scores. Kavindu is the ex-wife of Kalonzo's friend-turned-foe Johnston Muthama - who is also the former Machakos senator. Kalonzo on Wednesday said he is not out to wreck families as he unveiled former Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama’s ex-wife as the party’s candidate in the March 18 Senate by-election. “For the avoidance of doubt, this movement does not believe in wrecking families, we must make this very clear. We are not taking that name because of that any other name. What has guided the party is her own qualification as a leader who demonstrated high leadership capability,” Kalonzo said at Wiper headquarters in Karen. “She just happened to share the name with other people.”
