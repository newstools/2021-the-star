Red-hot Ulinzi Starlets are banking on their worrisome attack to reap maximum points against Makolanders on Sunday at Stima Club. The soldiers gunned down Mathare United 9-0 and coach Joseph Mwanza expects them to continue firing from all cylinders. Mwanza will once again rely on experienced top scorer Neddy Atieno and Jentrix Khuyudi who have five and three goals respectively. “We want to win all our remaining three matches in the first leg and that’s why we are going all out for maximum points against our opponents. We lost our first match against unbeaten Thika Queens and we are eager to close the gap. Our strikers are in fine form and it gives us an upper hand,” he said. Ulinzi are second in Zone ‘A’ with nine points. The soldiers have scored 18 goals in four matches, the highest in the whole league. Elsewhere in the Zone B, leaders Thika Queens host Kayole Starlets who were beaten 4-3 by Zetech Sparks last weekend. Mathare entertain Gaspo as Zetech come up against Kibera Soccer Ladies. Kibera salvaged a goal-less draw in their last fixture. In zone A, defending champions Vihiga Queens travel to Nakuru to tackle newbies Nakuru West Queens. The Vihiga county-sponsored team demolished Eldoret Falcons 5-0 in their last match with Terry Engesha scoring a hat-trick. A resurgent Wadadia play Eldoret Falcons, who are yet to test victory at Mumias Complex while the Chris Amwayi-coached Trans-Nzoia Falcons host Kisumu Starlets in Kitale. SEP Oyugis, who stopped Trans-Nzoia Falcons’ unbeaten run last time out, rub shoulders with Oserian Ladies.
