Kakamega Finance and Planning executive Beatrice Sabana has challenged revenue clerks to explore more revenue streams to boost their collection. She urged the clerks to stick to the e-Revenue Collection System, adding that any malfunctions should promptly be reported to the relevant offices. Sabana spoke on Monday afternoon during day one of a three-day training programme for the clerks at Bishop Nicholas Stam Pastoral Centre on the outskirts of Kakamega town. She warned the officers against corruption, saying anyone found engaging in the vice would be punished. Chief Officer James Ochami, who took the clerks through the Kakamega County Revenue Agency Strategic Plan, said enhanced revenue collection is key for socio-economic development. He said the county has the potential of raising Sh2 billion in local revenue annually. The officers were also sensitised on county laws, taxes, rates and communication skills.
