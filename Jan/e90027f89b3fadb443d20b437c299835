Nairobi City Stars second assistant coach John Amboko admitted that the club partially felt the absence of their boss Sanjin Alagic after kicking off the year with a 2-1 loss in the hands of Wazito. The result condemned the league returnees to their second loss of the season. Sanjin was conspicuously absent on the technical bench with his first assistant Nihad Nalbantic and Amboko, a former AFC Leopards defender, taking charge. The club's Chief Executive Officer Patrick Korir cleared the air on Sanjin's whereabouts, saying he travelled for a two-week long holiday on the eve of Christmas. Korir said the Bosnian tactician, who can now rest easy after being exonerated from the alleged use of racist language late last year against Vihiga United , was expected to resume duty this week and prepare for their next match against the win-less Posta Rangers. "The coachÂ left for a short holiday and we expect him back before we play Rangers in our next match," revealed the administrator Amboko, who also rued wastefulness in front of the goal for the result, noted Sanjic was instrumental in commanding the playing unit to collect points in the previous matches and his presence was missed. "His absence somehow contributed to the negative result. City Stars are like a family and working together motivates us to grind out results on the pitch. Despite his absence, we were in touch with him and we are looking forward to the reunion before we play Rangers," said the former defender at the club.
