Kenya Women's Premier League side Gaspo FC have been boosted by the return of dynamic midfielder Sheryl Angachi after recovering from a knee injury. Angachi was forced off with the injury during Gaspo's 2-1 loss to Thika Queens and coach Isaac Maluki believes her return is a major boost ahead of their congested fixture schedule in the coming fortnight. "Our midfield was porous the moment she was withdrawn. We also lost Rhoda Khakalia through injury and we totally lost the battle in midfield. Angachi has shaken off her injury but Rhoda remains on the treatment table. Angachi is the kind of player any coach would love to have in his team. Her return comes at a time when we need positive results," Maluki said. Gaspo will play five matches in two weeks beginning this weekend. They face Kayole Starlets at Ruiru grounds this Sunday during which they hope to return to winning ways after aÂ  2-1 loss to Thika Queens in their last match. The Gatundu-based side then face Zetech Sparks three days later, before ties against Ulinzi Starlets, Kibera Girls Soccer Academy and a yet to be named opponent in a cup tie. Maluki believes his side can reap maximum points from the fixtures because his charges are fit and raring to go. "Twelve points is the bare minimum for us and every player has an equal chance to feature. The eight new players are blending in well and they should get a run in the fixtures. We have to manage the squad well in order to enhance competition," he said. Maluki plans to use the five-substitution rule to rotate his squad with an aim to avoid injuries during the busy schedule. "When a team losses fitness towards the end of a match, it comes with a psychological effect as we saw in our last match. We have worked on the conditioning of the players and they look better and ready to deliver," he said.
