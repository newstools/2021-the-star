Kitui governor Charity Ngilu has defended Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka from DP’s claims. DP William Ruto had claimed that Kalonzo irregularly acquired a government’s land in Yatta area. But Kalonzo dismissed the claims saying that he is a man of integrity, and called upon the office of the Director of Criminal Investigations to probe him and set the record clear. Via Twitter on Tuesday, Ngilu told the Deputy President to keep off from the matter. “Kalonzo owns it(the land). And he acquired it very regularly and very legally,” Ngilu said. "As a former Minister of Lands, I checked the details of that land and I found that Kalonzo had acquired that land very well.” The governor has also criticised the DP’s hustler narrative, saying that he has been in leadership for about 30 years and issuing wheelbarrows and carts to the young people is not enough. “After so many years, the only thing that he can show, that he can do is to use the money that he has either sold land, or sold maize, or sold sugar then start buying our children wheelbarrows and mkokoteni," she said. "Eight years at the helm of government and he has just realized that that wheelbarrows will liberate the youth? The level of deceit from this fellow is appalling." In a press briefing on Monday, Kalonzo enumerated scandals – some involving billions of taxpayers’ money – that he claimed had Ruto’s fingerprints. Kalonzo challenged Ruto to subject himself to a lifestyle audit. Kalonzo said the DP has a known history for grabbing both public and private land.
