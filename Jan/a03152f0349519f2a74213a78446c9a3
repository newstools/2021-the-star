A cleric has urged the government to provide masks for learners, handwashing units and ensure adequate social distancing as schools reopen on Monday. Global Vision Church Bishop Robert Mutemi said students should not be sent home for school fees as Covid-19 has left many Kenyans struggling financially. He said most parents cannot afford to buy masks for their children or raise school fees. “The country is in a crisis and the education sector has been badly affected. The government should consider stepping in to ensure smooth reopening of schools,” he said. Mutemi spoke at Musuani Primary School in Mwingi West subcounty, Kitui, during the installation of Bishop Michael Kiloo. He said very little has been done, especially in rural areas where a single school hosts up to 6,000 learners. “How will social distancing be achieved here?” the Bishop asked. “It is not business as usual as Covid-19 is still here with us and learners ought to be highly protected from the virus.” He also castigated the government for engaging in politics at the expense of Kenyans, especially during this time when the country is battling the pandemic and the economy has been adversely affected. “We are not saying the BBI is bad, but there are other urgent and important things that should be prioritised. The government should cushion Kenyans during this period,” Mutemi said.
