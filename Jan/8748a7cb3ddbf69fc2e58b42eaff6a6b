The ODM party has announced it has embarked on a process to identify its presidential candidate for the 2022 presidential election. The party's National Election Board has been tasked to run an advertisement in local dailies to invite applications from interested candidates. The party also announced it will insist on an ODM nominee to fill in the position of Nairobi Deputy Governor. The Orange party had ceded fielding a candidate for the position of governor to Jubilee in the spirit of the handshake between its leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta. The decision was made during the Central Management Committee meeting chaired the party's deputy leaders Governors Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Hassan Joho (Mombasa). The party also dismissed media reports that Jubilee has introduced a fresh list of demands. The Nation had reported on Wednesday that the President now wants Raila to put pen to paper on their gentleman’s agreement for the Orange party to reap actual benefits of their political cooperation. The demand reportedly comes after ODM staked a claim to the Nairobi deputy governor’s post, citing its role in the impeachment of Mike Sonko. The Nation added that the president’s party is keen on formalising the deal and aligning it to the Constitution for ODM to continue enjoying the trappings of power associated with a ruling party. However, ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna said he is not aware of the new demands. Sifuna was accompanied by Oparanya, national chairman John Mbadi (Suba South), Junet Mohammed (Suna East), Gladys Wanga (Homabay MP) and Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja).
