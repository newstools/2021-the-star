The church has appealed to Kenyans to strictly follow protocols aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19. In his New Year message, Nyeri  Archdiocese  Archbishop Anthony Muheria said the war against the pandemic is far from over. "I wish to plead with you all Kenyans that we may fully follow these guidelines for the sake of our children, for the sake of our elderly and especially to bring to an end this pandemic," he said in a recorded message. Muheria, who battled the virus late last year, urged Kenyans not to get tired of wearing masks, washing hands and keeping social distance. "Please make it a habit, make a commitment to always wear your mask wherever you are. Make your commitment to defend your brother and sister through social distancing, wash your hands, do all you can. Also serve those who suffer and those who are sick."
