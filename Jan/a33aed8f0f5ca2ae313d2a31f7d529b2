Impeached Governor Mike Sonko sent a "blank" document to the county Speaker claiming to withdraw the nomination of Anne Kananu as deputy governor, she has said. Speaking during her vetting on Friday, Kananu claimed that Sonko had sent her a blank document with no signature or stamp, alleging to have withdrawn her name as the nominee. " The purpose of that video was to show the public that he had sent the letter to me but I can confidently say the letter was blank with no authorising signature or stamp. The letter was not even dated December 7th," she said. Kananu was responding to Majority Leader Abdi Hassan Guyo who had questioned her on a video that went viral on Sonko having a conversation with Kananu on the alleged withdrawal letter. The Deputy Governor nominee also said her relationship with Sonko was purely professional for the past three years. " Former Governor Sonko was my boss whom I had a pure working relationship with. Under him I served as the Chief officer for Disaster management and also as acting chief officer for Water," Kananu added. Last week, Sonko said  that he withdrew Kananu’s name as deputy governor nominee, therefore 'blocking ' the assembly from proceeding with vetting. He claimed he wrote to the county Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura on December 7, 2020 withdrawing the name. However, Acting Governor and County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura in a sworn affidavit claimed that the" withdrawal" letter was forged by the usage of an alleged stamp and his office never received it. He highlighted that the purported withdrawal letter does not have any signature indicative of the person who has received the same as is the procedure. Consequently, he wrote a complaint letter to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations asking it to expeditiously investigate the matter.
