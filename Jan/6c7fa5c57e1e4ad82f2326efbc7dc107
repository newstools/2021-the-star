When they say music is a universal language, you better believe it and Sauti Sol can bare witness to this. The celebrated Kenyan boy band has all the reasons to smile as the band is clearly here to win. Well, Sauti Sol's famous song, 'Suzanna' was spotted at Times Square New York, playing in the huge screens for a campaign by YouTube. This comes at a time when YouTube did a campaign with the hashtag #YouTubeBlack. Taking to social media, Sauti Sol expressed gratitude to even have been considered for the campaign. "We're really excited to be part of the first #YouTubeBlack Voices Artist Class along with 20 other incredible artists. Our identity informs our sonics, our storytelling, and our fashion. Much like our country, Kenya, our music is multi-layered, with an East Africa groove.
