A manhunt has been launched for a 31-year-old man suspected to have defiled and impregnated a school going child in Makueni. While at school, the 13-year-old pupil at Kathonzweni Holy Ghost Mission Primary had complained of abdominal pain. This forced the school's administration to call her mother to take her to hospital. "Examination on her condition revealed that she was expectant, thereafter disclosing to have been defiled by the suspect," DCI director George Kinoti said. The suspect, Reuben Mutie of Kwa Kavisi location, has since been on the run. "Should anyone have information on the suspected paedophile on the loose, please call our toll-free hotline 0800 722 203 for immediate action," Kinoti said. Last month, a similar case was reported where a Meru bodaboda rider was said to have defiled an eight-year-old girl. Detectives said the suspect offered the girl a ride to her home at Baibariu in Igembe South, but along the way diverted to his house where he committed the act. He later dropped the helpless minor near their homestead before taking off into hiding. This was a day after a Kenya Defence Forces soldier was arrested for defiling a minor.
