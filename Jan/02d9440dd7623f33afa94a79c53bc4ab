Three MPs and Nyamira speaker Moffat Teya are blocking James Gesami from taking his roles as deputy governor, former Senator Kennedy Mong'are has said. Mong’are said the legislators are determined to block Gesami from taking his appointment by Governor Amos Nyaribo over flimsy and unfounded accusations. “I have reliable information that some three MPs in Nyamira county are working hard to ensure that Gesami does not sail through to the helm of DG over some reckless accusations that he is old and tired for the post. There is no law that bars him from taking office at his age‚” Mongare said. He said Teya should have recused himself from chairing the Appointments committee if he wanted the deputy governor’s post. The ex-senator said that Teya is likely to use the platform to ensure that Gesami is rejected and produce biased results on the vetting to settle scores. Mong'are asked the MCAs to assist Governor Nyaribo, who took over on December 29 after the death of his boss John Nyagarama, to complete the term smoothly. Meanwhile, Borabu MP Ben Momanyi has declared war on Nyaribo's administration, saying the governor had neglected the youth when naming his Executive committee. “It is not a favour, a youth must be in that cabinet. There is no way only old men and women can be employed and youths who make the majority in the country are left out,” he said. Momanyi also wondered why the position of deputy governor could not have gone to a youthful person. “When our governor Nyagarama died and there was a vacancy at the DG, we thought the new governor could consider youth to the position. Instead, Nyaribo has gone ahead and nominated Gesami who is 75 years old. I wonder what kind of service the duo will offer at their age,” he said. The MP was in the company of North Mugirango's Joash Nyamoko and Embakasi South’s Julias Mawathe in Ikonge Primary where they led Bunge FC in a friendly with local teams on Sunday.
