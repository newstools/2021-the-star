Four youths have been charged with creating disturbances at the United Democratic Alliance Party's office. According to the charge sheet, they committed the offence with others not before the court in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace by throwing stones and pushing the gate of the said offices. The four had allegedly gone to demand Sh2,000 pay and a wheelbarrow from the offices. Erick Arimba, Dennis Nzeki, Simon Kamau and Steve Gumbo were charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki on Thursday where they denied the charges. They are accused of committing the offence on January 14 at the UDA offices party in Lavington area in Dagoreti sub-county within Nairobi county. The police report says that the police officers from Muthangari Police Station were called to UDA offices and informed that there were youths numbering around 150 who were causing chaos and creating disturbances at the offices. However, through their lawyer Holly Edward, they denied the charges and said that they never committed the offences. Holly Edward and lawyer Makori urged the court to released their clients on Sh10,000 cash as they were not a flight risk and were not in a position to pay unrealistic cash bail. The magistrate released them on Sh10,000 cash bail or a bond of Sh150,000. The case will be mentioned next month.
