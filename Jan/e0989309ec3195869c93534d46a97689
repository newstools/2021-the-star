The 2008 league champions Mathare United have parted ways with the duo of Moses Mburu and Francis Omondi ahead of the 2020/2021 mid-season transfer window . Omondi, who arrived at the club three years ago from National Super League side Modern Coast Rangers, left the 'Slum Boys' following the expiration of his contract. Until his departure, the stocky holding midfielder was the club's first choice penalty taker. Mburu on the other hand didn't last in his second stint at the club having rejoined at the start of the season. According to the club, the left-back who is a qualified aircraft dispatcher, left  to concentrate on his field of study. The club had re-signed Mburu at the start of the season to fill the void left by David Owino, who decamped to KCB. The club's chief executive officer Jecton Obure as quoted on the club's portal they  couldn't stand in Mburu's way of pursuing his other career. “Mburu’s case is much different and there is little we could do. In as far as  Omondi is concerned, we didn't agree on a renewal of his deal thus the latest move. We respect both players’ decisions and wish them all the best for the future," he said. Meanwhile coach Salim Ali regretted the latest development but promised to shop for their replacements. “It is unfortunate we are losing players of their calibre, especially during this time of the season. They are players who could have helped us a great deal but all in all, it is the nature of our business and we must respect their wishes,” said the former player.
