Nurses have hit back at the Council of Governors over allegations that nurses in the country get 16 allowances. The union has further accused the council chair Wycliffe Oparanya of peddling lies in regards to the ongoing strike saying nurses are entitled to only four allowances. Speaking in Nairobi on Monday, the fire-breathing KNUN SG Seth Panyako said the striking nurses will not go back to work unless their return to work formula is signed. The nurses arrived at a conclusion on all the grievances they had raised but the ready document has been gathering dust at the Labour offices, Panyako said. The CoG has refused to append its signature to the document on grounds that the counties were not consulted. "We are ready to meet with the Council of Governors anywhere even if it is traveling to the moon just to ensure our return to work formula is signed," Panyako said. He warned Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua against threatening striking nurses with show-cause letters, adding he will stop at nothing to ensure nurses in the country are not sacked.
