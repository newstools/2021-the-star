The EACC has helped to recover major public utility land grabbed by powerful individuals in Eldoret town. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago said on Monday the recovered land includes property where the district hospital, the fire station and county assembly offices are located. He said the county had referred many other land grabbing complaints to the National Land Commission, which was in the process of recovering land and revoking titles. “We are happy the EACC has done a good job for us by helping to repossess the government land that had been illegally taken over by some individuals," the governor said. He said the town required land for public utilities like schools and hospitals but most of the space set aside many years ago had been grabbed or illegally allocated to some individuals. Mandago said the county would use the recovered land to expand hospitals and other facilities. “Many cases are being handled by the EACC and we urge them to speed up the process so we can get back the plots and protect them for use by the public," the governor said. Mandago said the county was working with other departments to ensure public plots are identified, fenced and protected after titles are issued by the NLC. The EACC also has recovered the Administration Police quarters next to the district hospital and fire station. It also recovered land where the High Court in Eldoret is located. The governor said all other land matters or conflicts involving private land were being dealt with through the courts and other organs. He said they should not be the source of major disputes. Mandago said no one should use land issues to cause ethnic animosity or divisions in the county. Some of the individuals who grabbed public land have been filing court cases to stop the county, the NLC and EACC from recovering it. (Edited by V. Graham)
