Learners continued to troop back to school on Day 2 of resumption of studies on Tuesday. The government has released Sh18 billion to primary and secondary schools, Education CS George Magoha has said. The money is part of the capitation for free primary and free day secondary education to public schools across the country. Of the cash, Sh4 billion will go to primary schools and another Sh14.4 billion for secondary schools. The release of the funds will be a relief to school heads who had warned over a possible halt of operations for lack of finances. The CS said by Tuesday 80 per cent of learners had reported back to school. Schools were reopened for face-to-face for all classes on Monday after a nine-month closure due to Covid-19.
