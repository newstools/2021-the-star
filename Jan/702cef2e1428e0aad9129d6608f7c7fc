Transport along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway was temporarily paralysed on Monday night after yet another pedestrian was hit and killed by a speeding car. It was the fourth pedestrian death since the year began. Irate residents blocked the road to protest the death as the victim was rushed to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital where he was pronounced dead. James Kabono from Naivasha Safety Group said the driver escaped and is being sought by police who are tracing the plate number and registration. “The man was crossing the road on his way home when he was hit by the speeding car and he died on his way to hospital,” he said. He identified Kayole, Raini, KCC, Mithuri and Karai as some of the centres affected by accidents along the highway. “We need speed bumps along these sections as this is where pedestrians are struck," Kabono said. Meanwhile, the  search for a missing woman in Kinangop, Nyandarua county ended after her children stumbled upon her body lying in a thicket. They were collecting firewood near Kenton village. She had been missing for a week after she was reported missing on Thursday last week..Emotions ran high as police removed the body and residents feared she had been sexually abused before she was murdered. Resident Joel Wambugu said the woman was well known and her death had left area residents in fear and shock. The family reported the missing person at Magumu police station last Thursday. “The family has frantically searched for the woman in the last four days before the body was found in a thicket by her children,” Wambugu said. Area chief Ng’ang’a Njuguna said police were investigating. A postmortem will be conducted at the Naivasha mortuary. (Edited by V. Graham)
