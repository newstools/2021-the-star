Proponents of the Building Bridges Initiative process have a Herculean task in popularising its contents as a majority of Kenyans are unfamiliar with them. A new poll shows that 84 per cent of Kenyans are unaware of the BBI proposals despite a referendum likely to be held by June. The poll by research firm Tifa shows that 53 per cent of Kenyans know nothing about BBI. Another 31 per cent know only a little. “This is an indication of the need for public sensitisation in order for Kenyans to make an informed choice,” Tifa said in a statement on Friday. The poll comes just five days after Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata claimed BBI faces a humiliating defeat in the Mt Kenya region. But 10 governors from the region said Kenyans needed civic education on the contents of the document. The governors said it is very premature to judge the Bill as it has just been published for public participation and intensive discussion at the grassroots. “It is at this level that the entire leadership will be expected to educate and sensitize wananchi, with elected leaders expected to play a key role in these public engagements without fear of intimidation or coercion,” the governors said. “All Governors attest that wananchi are waiting for the published Bill. To intimate that the Mt Kenya region is opposed to the document at this stage is not only preposterous but also a serious misrepresentation of facts and reality, and we repeat very premature.” Tifa collected the between December 8 and 19 last year, two weeks before Kang’ata warned President Uhuru Kenyatta that BBI could flop in the region. The sample size for the poll was 1,550 respondents. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 per cent.
