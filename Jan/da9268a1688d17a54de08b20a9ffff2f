Kenyans will soon get copies of the summarised version of the Building Bridges Initiative report, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga has said. He said the booklets were being published and will soon be distributed to wananchi saying the current report is bulky and may be cumbersome to many Kenyans. The ODM leader dismissed those opposed to the BBI asking them to stop spreading propaganda against his unity bid with President Uhuru Kenyatta. There are concerns that many Kenyans are unaware of the content of the BBI document, part of which requires a referendum to implement. “There is propaganda against BBI. It is a good thing for all Kenyans. The book is huge and has a lot of issues. They are publishing a summarised version,” Raila said in an interview with Kameme FM on Monday. The ODM leader persuaded Mt Kenya to get to know the truth about the BBI report to make an informed decision on the same. Raila dangled the carrots in the BBI saying it had better tidings for the youth, women, and common mwananchi. The former premier further dismissed the notion that the proposed Constitutional changes to bring in a Prime Minister and two deputies will increase the cost of running government. “What we are proposing will be much cheaper compared with today since ministers will come from parliament and will only earn allowances for the additional job,” Raila said.
