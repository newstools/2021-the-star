The Interior ministry has said mass printing of Huduma Namba cards has started. In a Twitter update, it said, "Mass printing of Huduma Namba cards is underway. If you registered, you will soon receive an SMS notification prompting you when and where to collect yours." Last year, the government said national IDs will cease being in operation by December 12, 2021 andÂ will be replaced by Huduma Namba cards. The government had said the first lot of three million Kenyans would receive their cards by this month and another five million by February. It said the government has ensured that all the data will be protected. President Uhuru Kenyatta and First Lady Margaret Kenyatta were handed the first two samples of Huduma Cards on October 20 last year, during the Mashujaa Day celebrations at Gusii Stadium in Kisii County.
