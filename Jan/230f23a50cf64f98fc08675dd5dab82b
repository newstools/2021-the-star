Tupike, Tuilinde, Tugawe kwa Haki. (Let's cook, protect and share) These were the words of ODM party leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday when he met ODM county chiefs. Raila while gearing support for Building Bridges Initiative said their mission in BBI is to bake a bigger cake. "....protect it from thieves and share it equitably...shared prosperity," he said. "That was my message to ODM county chairs today whom I asked to make BBI a core ODM business. Handshake remains strong." The meeting was with ODM party leadership from across 47 counties. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, Council of Governor Chairperson Wycliffe Oparanya are among officials present. Three days ago, Raila continued with his tours to popularise BBI. He was at Ufungamano House, accompanied with other ODM leaders, including Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, who is also the co-chair of the BBI secretariat, Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris and Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo. Raila has been on a BBI popularisation frenzy. Raila has hinted at a plan to mount a joint countrywide charm offensive with President Uhuru Kenyatta during the 2021 presidential run. He said they will be targeting the grassroots in what is seen as a strategy to turn the tables on Deputy President William Ruto. The handshake partners have started their quest by rallying ODM and Jubilee youth leaders to work together to campaign for the Building Bridges Initiative, starting with Nairobi.
