A mining company has sought orders seeking to suspend a directive by Mining CS John Munyes that will see companies transport their minerals to his office for inspection. Rockland Company Limited says the move poses a serious security risk and further forces them to incur huge expenses for security purposes. The directive dated September 7, 2017, requires the minerals to be photographed which is causing a delay when companies are doing a large shipment. "We do not know why the photographs are taken. In addition, the net effect of the procedures by the CS results in delays of up to four weeks causing us great losses," says Rockland. The documents were filed at the Milimani Law Courts Registry.
