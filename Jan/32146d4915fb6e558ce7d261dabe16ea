Diamond Platnumz' sister and singer Queen Darleen is married as the second wife of Mtoro Isihaka, a business tycoon. The two tied the knot in December 2019 at a private Islam wedding ceremony. Since then, Sabra, Isihaka's first wife, has not been in good terms with Queen Darleen. Sabra was said to have been trolled for not having a child with the Tanzanian businessman. Barely a year later, Queen Darleen and the tycoon welcomed a baby girl, Balqis Isihaka. Well, it seems the man's first wife Sabra has now moved on with another man and she is enjoying it. In an Instagram post, she wrote that she had to hurt in orderÂ to heal. Adding, "I love you so much my new husband, you are my one and only."
