After his sole goal against Kakamega Homeboyz earned Tusker a priceless away win last weekend, youthful forward Henry Meja has revealed his intentions of finishing the season with at least 15 goals. Meja plundered home the winner for brewers, a goal which doubled his tally in the season, having scored his first goal in the top flight against Gor Mahia last month. The 19-year-old joined Tusker in January last year after emerging the Most Valuable Player (MVP) as well as the top scorer during the 2018 edition of the Cleophas Malala Super Cup. Despite coach Robert Matano preferring to use him as a substitute this season, Meja who enjoys the rare opportunity of playing with his brother Sammy at the club is not shying away from setting sky-high targets. "I am glad to have netted my second goal of the season. The goal motivates me to leap towards my ambition of scoring at least 15 goals in the campaign. Last weekend, we played against a tough opponent but the half time pep-talk by the coach made the difference," he said. Meja's brilliance in front of the goal procured him plaudits from Matano who said it was just a matter of time before he walked to the starting team. The experienced tactician expressed hope that the youngster who he lauded for his hard work would continue proving himself an asset going forward. "He is a good player and we are gradually trying to integrate him into the starting team. He has began well and has shown willingness to learn. I am confident he will keep the fire burning in our coming matches," remarked the league winning coach
