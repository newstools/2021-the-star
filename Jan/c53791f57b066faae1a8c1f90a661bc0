Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia has eulogised the Star's county writer Ndicuhu Wainana as In a statement on Thursday, he said, "One of the pioneer devolution journalists in Kenya, Ndichu sought to faithfully tell Nyandaruaâ€™s changing narratives." "I will never forget the many times he directly reached out to me and other senior County Government officials for more information, believing that his task was incomplete until he had a clearer view of people, issues and events. Ndichu used his pen to not only shine a light on our human condition, but also help us talk with each other." Wainaina passed on on Thursday. He began working for the Star in 2016. Nyandarua's director of communication Jesse Mwai said Wainaina possessed dogged determination. "He was also fair-minded and a stickler for accuracy." "I experienced Ndichu's doggedness when I began serving the people of Nyandarua in 2015. Barely settled in my role, he visited my office and asked if I knew anyone who could accept his work outside the county."
