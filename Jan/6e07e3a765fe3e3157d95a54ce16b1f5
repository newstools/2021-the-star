Shabana maintained their five-match unbeaten run in the National Super League after dispatching bottom of the table Murang’a Seals 3-1 at Nyantika Maiyoro Stadium, Gusii. Shabana’s interim coach Joseph Ongoro praised his charges for the win and  thanked them for maintaining  unbeaten run since he took over the team. “As a Christian, I first of all want to thank God for the good run. We can’t chest thump because the glory goes back to God,” said Ongoro. He added: “We were sloppy in the beginning because some the players are inexperienced. Most of them are aged 21 years and below and it takes time to gel with their senior counterparts.” It was sweet victory for Ongoro, who ran over a team coached by his former boss at Shabana, Vincent Nyaberi. Murang’s Seals' assistant coach Kennedy Otieno bemoaned the penalty decision which gave Shabana the equaliser. “The penalty was unjustified and the football’s governing body should address this. It affected the morale of the players leading to the loss. However, all is not lost. We will not stay bottom of the table for long because despite the loss against Shabana, we played well and we will target our first win next weekend,” added Otieno. During the game, lanky former Gor Mahia striker John Kiplangat gave Murang’a Seals  shock lead against the run of play in the 27th minute. Kevin Omundi equalised for Shabana in the 37th minute through a penalty  awarded after a Murang’a Seals defender handled the ball in the box. In the second half, Brian Michira added Shabana’s second goal with Enock Momanyi aka Makacha scoring the third goal for the Glamour Boys. Shabana made their first change of the game, bringing in veteran midfielder Maurice Dukully for Timothy Luda. The move by Ongoro was a masterstroke as Dukully stabilised the midfield.
