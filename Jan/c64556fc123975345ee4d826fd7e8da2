The Bomet county government has formed a 10-member team to look into its solid waste menace and recommend ways of dealing with the problem. The technical and advisory committee formed by Deputy Governor Shadrack Rotich was given 30 days to conduct a study and come up with a report and action plan on handling waste. The committee will be chaired by county Nema director Samuel Ondeng. It is expected to explore modern ways of garbage disposal that are environmentally resilient. The team will also submit a comprehensive proposal on proper waste management. It is also tasked with carrying out a study on the county's solid waste management chain from source to disposal and designing a modern dumpsite. The team will also conduct public participation in compiling the report and the development of a solid waste management strategy. Members of the team include officials from the departments of public health and urban planning, engineers, physical planners, surveyors and architects. Most Bomet town streets are littered with waste, most often falling off tractors and trucks full of garbage. Several efforts to find a proper dumpsite have proven fruitless following the push and pull involved with the residents often resisting plans to establish a dumpsite in their areas.  Edited by P.O
