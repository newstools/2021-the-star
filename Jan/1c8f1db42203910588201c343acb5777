The people of Central Kenya have no problem with the projects implemented by President Uhuru Kenyatta in the region. In fact, there is at least a road project by the national government going in our villages and every ward. If you ask the residents who is doing the projects, they will tell you it is not their MP but the President. If you ask them who they will vote for as President in 2022, they will tell you William Ruto. If you ask ‘What if the President gives you another person?', they will tell you they respect the President because he has done a lot for them, but their hearts are with Ruto. BBI is a different story. People are facing very many challenges. However much we try to sugarcoat BBI, the region is not ready to support it. What people want are policies on coffee, tea and dairy products. Deployment of state machinery will not be enough to ensure that BBI passes. The feeling here is that BBI is only here to promote a few people. For a long time, people in this region have been made to hate Raila Odinga. The handshake and state machinery will not change that. It will take time. If BBI comes without Raila in it, maybe that would work. If the President tells Raila to stop supporting BBI or asks him to keep quiet, maybe it would pass in this area. In Mt Kenya, people’s hearts are with William Ruto. That is the honest opinion.  People are hungry, they are not happy with the prices of milk, tea and coffee and finally the Raila factor in BBI. It is not that people don’t like Uhuru. People do not hate him. They hate the fact that Uhuru wants to bring in Raila. If tomorrow Uhuru says Ruto power, his popularity will rise tenfold in Mt Kenya.
