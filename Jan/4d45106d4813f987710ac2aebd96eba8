Veteran actor Raymond Ofula says passion and discipline are the secrets behind his success in the industry. Raymond has featured in countless local programmes, such as 'Makutano Junction' and 'Better Days'. He has also made appearances in international films, such as 'The White Maasai', 'Jacob's Cross' (South Africa) and 'Wintereisse' (Germany). Speaking to Word Is, he said that while preparing for a role, he likes to have some moments alone and let his mind walk through the scene. "I imagine I am a viewer watching the scene and being captivated by the character I am playing. When going through lines with the other character/s I try to feel the chemistry between us," he said. Sometimes when there are only two in a scene, he likes to stare intensely at the other character without the other knowing, and this helps him implant that other character's role in his psyche. He is currently the lead actor in 'Monica', a film showing on Showmax, acting as a governor and a parent. "I am a symbol of and exude authority, but I am also vulnerable to Monica's machinations and Jeena's seduction. So I bring strength and weakness in equal measure." He says his best role so far was 'Ngoya', a character in the play 'Aminata' by Francis Imbuga. To maintain his fitness, Raymond regularly does callisthenics first thing in the morning besides working out in the gym. "I do intense workouts in the gym, three times a week," he said. Asked why the Kenyan film sector has shown some advance in the quality of content in the recent past, Raymond attributed this to the tenacity of filmmakers, who've ventured beyond production for local media houses. "Media houses tended to insist on low-quality comedy rather than quality stories."
