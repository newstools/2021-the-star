Kenya Rugby League team have lined up five test matches this year. KRL chairman, Richard Nyakwaka, said the two test series against South Africa will be played alongside matches against Fiji , Samoa and Tonga. Nyakwaka said the test matches will be used to gauge the team's growth and potential. “We want to play against the top teams in the world and measure ourselves and inspire the young boys,” he added. The two test series against South Africa earlier slated for last year were cancelled owing to to the Covid-19 pandemic. Nyakwaka was confident the team could qualify for the 2025 Rugby League World Cup. “We have started the journey in terms of enrolment of players and match officials. We want to have a very vibrant league, where we can tap talent to mould and grow for the next three to four years,” he added. The former Mwamba, Impala and Kenyan international expressed confidence that the domestic league will kick off in April. So far, the league has attracted eight teams from Kisii, Kakamega, Kisumu, Nakuru, Kitengela, Nkubu, Machakos and Kiambu. “We have a very good spread of teams across the country and I hope in the next two seasons, we can expand to coast and other regions,” he observed. The federation held their first tournament in February last year at the Railway club with Wolves overcoming Rhinos in the final. Nyakwaka added that plans were in place to host a tournament at Kalama conservancy in Samburu in the course of the year. "We are looking at various international teams coming over to Samburu in the course of the year though we are yet to settle for a date, ” he added.
