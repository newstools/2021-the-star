Kenya Power has promised customers in western Kenya steady power supply by March. Power supply has been unreliable in the region, leaving many businesses and domestic consumers suffering. Managing director Bernard Ngugi said the company is working round the clock to stabilise supply within the region. He said they have many customers and the company must not lose the opportunity to sell electricity to them. Ngugi on Thursday announced that a new line from Olkaria-Lessos terminating in Kisumu will be ready beginning March, which will end blackouts in the region. “This is coming with a message from our CS Charles Keter that in the beginning of March this will be a problem of the past,” Ngugi said. The MD said the company loses huge revenues whenever there is a blackout within the region. “This is a matter that is of concern to us. The government is fully aware of the challenges faced by the public during outages and everything is being done to remedy the situation,” he told the media during the launch of the Smart Metering Project in Kisumu. Ngugi was responding to a concern raised by the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kisumu chapter chairman Israel Agina on the losses businesspeople incur in the region during blackouts. Agina told Kenya Power to look into a long-term solution to the matter, which they have raised over time. KETRACO is currently implementing the Olkaria – Lessos - Kisumu transmission project, which entails the construction of a double-circuit transmission line between Olkaria II and Kisumu substations via Lessos substation. The project traverses Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, Nandi and Kisumu counties. The line is expected to transmit geothermal power from the fields in Olkaria to Western Kenya. Consumers say the power supply to western Kenya is unreliable and expensive and there is a need to connect the region to the reliable geothermal supply to avoid downtimes and reduce the cost.
