Pupils at Kinyau Primary School in Kitui Rural subcounty have missed the national assessment intended to establish gaps brought about by the long Covid-19 shutdown. On Monday, some parents got them out of the school, protesting what they termed the headteacher’s lack of openness in the affairs of the school, especially the use of funds. The aggrieved parents want head teacher Stephen Mugambi removed from the school. Mugambi on Wednesday said the parents stormed the school and ordered learners to leave, effectively shutting down the institution. Mugambi regretted that all the learners missed their assessment tests. The children were at home as the assessment went on countrywide. “Some few parents stormed the school without regard to Covid-19 protocols. Using the local Kamba language, they ordered all the children out of school. Three mean-lo0king gentlemen then came to my office and asked me to leave,” he said. He said he was adamant that he was not going to adhere to their orders and advised them to follow the right channels to have him removed without applying the law of the jungle. “I even asked them to report to the police if they thought I had committed any criminal offence. They, however, threatened to waylay me outside the school compound and kill me as I walked on the road,” Mugambi said. He reported the threats to his life to the Kanyangi police station. Efforts to get comments from Kitui county director of education were unsuccessful. He did not return calls.
