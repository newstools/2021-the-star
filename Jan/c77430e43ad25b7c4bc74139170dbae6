Showmax has released the teaser for Monica Season 3, premiering on January 21, 2021. Picked up by Showmax for a third season in October 2020, the Kenyan drama series follows Brenda Wairimu, who has also starred in Subira and Disconnect, in the titular role of Monica, an ambitious social climber from the ghetto who will do anything to become part of the elite. The released teaser offers a sneak peek into Monica’s ‘perfect’ life as a woman on top of the world, juggling two romances, before her love life and career begins to crumble. Also returning for the new season alongside Brenda is Raymond Ofula (Queen Sono, The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind), Fidel Maithya (Selina, A Beautiful Disaster), Ephy Saint (Tahidi High), Joyce Maina (Aisha, Neophobia), Sam Komora (Aziza), Rosemary Waweru (Tabasamu, Pray and Prey), and Kauthar Kang’ethe (Midlife Crisis, Machachari). Monica is the third collaboration between producer Scolly Cheruto and director Neil Schell, who’ve worked together on another Kenyan drama, Twisted, and Kenya’s first animated superhero series, Machismo. Schell has also previously directed other local favourites like Saints, which was Kenya’s first medical drama series, High Learning and Rush. Monica S3 launches on Showmax on 21 January 2021. While you wait, you can still binge-watch season 1 and 2 which are also available on Showmax. Watch the trailer below
