Kenya has received debt service waivers of $378 million (about Sh41 billion) from China to help ease the financial distresses linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. This was revealed by Central Bank Governor Patrick Njoroge at a post-Monetary Policy Committee media briefing on Thursday, indicating that a total of $600 million of debt due between January 1 to June 30 has been postponed. He added that G20 has committed to consider extending the relief period beyond June, a decision that will be made in April at IMF's spring meeting. Njoroge said the debt relief from Kenya’s external creditor gives the country an opportunity and break to pursue the kind of liquidity it desires. The postponed repayment debt to China is $133 million above what the National Treasury announced last week. Earlier this month, the Paris Club agreed to delay $300 million in payments by Kenya. Kenya joined several other African governments seeking debt-repayment pauses as it struggles to deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The virus muted social economic activities in the country, hurting revenue collection amid high debt obligations. The country is expected to clear Sh904 billion debt in the current financial year. It was initially reluctant to G20 offer saying the terms of the deal were too restrictive and it also fretted the impact that debt relief might have on Kenya’s credit rating. The country’s exchequer, for instance, was concerned that terms of the deal limiting countries’ access to international capital markets during the standstill could hinder Kenya’s ability to finance its deficit later in the year. In April last year, officials from the G20 countries announced plans to suspend both the principal repayments and interest payments on loans for the world’s poorest countries, lasting up to the end of the year. The move was aimed at releasing more than $20 billion for the underprivileged countries to use in fighting the global coronavirus pandemic.
