Posta Rangers head coach Sammy 'Pamzo' Omollo has given the clearest indication that youthful and the club's second-choice goalkeeper Bryne Omondi could retain the first-choice role going forward. Omondi's long prayer for playing time was finally answered two weeks ago after he was summoned to replace Jairus Adira, who was sent off during their one-all draw against Nairobi City Stars, forcing Pamzo to throw him into the deep end. The former Tusker custodian, who clocked 90 minutes in their 1-0 away win to Vihiga United a week ago, once again pulled top drawer saves against Ulinzi Stars last weekend to bag his second clean sheet. The duel staged at the Utalii grounds ended 0-0. Pamzo praised Omondi for the courage and distribution skills he has displayed in the few minutes he has played thus far and predicted the youngster to fully outshine the experienced Adira who has been enjoying undisrupted playing time. “He has taken his chance from the time Adira was red-carded and consequently suspended for a game. Conceding a goal in three matches is a sign that he is sure with what he is doing. He is strong and commands his area well and should he keep the fire burning, then he will be my first choice goalkeeper. For Adira, he has to work harder if he is dislodge Omondi,” said the retired Kenyan international. Meanwhile, with the local transfer window set to open next month, Pamzo revealed his plan of signing two strikers to breathe life into his misfiring forward. The club has scored a paltry six goals in eight matches, a worrying return, which Pamzo believes will be solved by the arrival of the two poachers said to be attached to clubs in the lower tiers. "So far,  I am pleased with the way the team has been defending. We have to work on our attack and this means I have to add the punch up front. I didn't want to go for big names. Instead, I identified two strikers from the lower leagues as shopping in the top flight is difficult," he adde.
