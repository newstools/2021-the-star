The government will carry out a massive and aggressive disarmament in Wajir, Garissa and Isiolo counties to restore peace to the region. Interior CS Fred Magiang'i on Tuesday announced that security agencies are mapping the area ahead of what he called an "aggressive disarmament exercise". It doesn't sound like, "Please, may we have your illegal guns?" The region has borne the brunt of terrorism, clan wars at the boundaries of the three counties, feuds over limited water and pasture. Matiang’i added some of the violence is instigated by politicians ahead of the 2022 elections, a trend, he said, will be stopped. “Some of these violence incidents have a relationship to a political activity, intention or expressions.” “The Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai is already working on the logistics ahead of that [disarmament],” the CS said. He spoke after meeting governors and leaders of the three counties at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. Present were Isiolo Governor Mohammed Kuti, his Wajir counterpart Mohammed Abdi and Garissa's Ali Korane. All regional security administrators attended. All security administrators from the region also attended the meeting. Matiang’i said the government will audit the National Police Reservists in the area, following a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The audit will inform how and where more security resources and personnel should be added. The Interior CS directed area chiefs to strictly serve within their administrative units, saying those overstepping jurisdictional boundaries will be fired. “We have agreed in principle we need to bring to an end this violence by finding the solution to our problems,” Korane said. “We have agreed as leaders to lead in this peace process through further consultations.” Apart from terrorism in Garissa, Wajir and Mandera counties, other areas including Marsabit and Isiolo face frequent inter-clan attacks, he said.
