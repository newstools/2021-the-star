Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen now wants President Uhuru Kenyatta to withdraw his statement over communities in leadership in the country. The president on Saturday signalled that maybe the time has come for other communities to lead the nation. Uhuru said that Kenya has been led by only two communities since independence and that it might be the time for other communities that have not tasted leadership to take over. "Ata mimi naweza simama hapa na niseme kuna jamii tu mbili za Kenya ambazo zimetawala. Labda ni nafasi ya jamii nyengine pia kutawala. Jamii za Kenya ni mingi," Uhuru said. During a Church service on Sunday at House of Hope Church, Kayole, Murkomen said Uhuru should take back his comments during his next presidential State of the Nation address. The former Majority leader claimed the president is being wrongfully advised and his sentiments could leave people feeling sidelined. "In the next State of the Nation address, I want to request the president to correct the things he said yesterday in Vihiga and restate the true position of the country where we will organize ourselves not based on tribes but as a united country,"Murkomen said. "There is no other president who has ever said something like that in this Republic since 1963. Any statement by the president is a national policy. "He needs to correct that position so that our country can come back to that sense. Otherwise, in part of the country, people will be feeling disenfranchised," Murkomen added.
