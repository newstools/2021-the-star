The Kenya Airports Authority has closed two terminals at JKIA as the Sh963 million refurbishment starts. In a statement on Saturday, the authority said it has closed Terminal 1B and C during the renovation which is meant to improve the passenger experience at the airport. All flight operations previously in T1B and T1C have now been migrated to Terminal 1A and Terminal 2. The 12-month airport development project aims to refurbish the departure halls to improve the check-in, security screening, retail operations, and passenger lounge experience. The authority said that once completed, the newly renovated light-filled departure terminals will deliver modern concessions as well as amenities that will give travelers a friendly experience. According to KAA Acting CEO Alex Gitari, the refurbishment and facelift of the T1B and 1C aim to align the passenger experience in terminals to watch what is being offered at T1A. “The remodeling project is an integral part of the ongoing JKIA Customers Service Improvement Plan (CSIP) which was formulated from feedback from our stakeholders and customers,” Gitari said.
