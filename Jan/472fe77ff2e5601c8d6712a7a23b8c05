More than 27 Mukuiru Day and Boarding Secondary School students on Tuesday lost property worth thousands of shillings after a fire razed their dormitory. Tuesday’s fire incident at the school in Karama ward of Tigania East was the third in less than two years. The cause of the fire is yet to be established. Tigainia East subcounty education officer Yatani Seru said investigations are under way. Seru thanked residents for responding quickly and extinguishing the fire before it spread to other buildings. He urged the residents to provide any information they have that can explain the recurrent school fires. “Is there an antidevelopment agent within the community who wants to sabotage the growth of the school? We want to know the problem and whoever is behind this destruction. The school opened on Monday,” he said. Seru urged parents not to panic as all the 27 girls who were present are secure and safe. The school will not be closed. “I have talked to the board and agreed they apply for NG-CDF emergency fund,” he said. He said the fire was an accident and everything has returned to normal. “We will improve security at the institution. We only have suspects. We need night surveillance to weed out criminals,” he said. The officer appealed to well-wishers to help the learners whose property were destroyed continue with their studies uninterrupted. Area chief Jeremiah Murira said his office will help with the investigations into the cause of the fire. Some residents accused Governor Kiraitu Murungi’s administration of failure to provide fire extinguishers despite receiving their distress calls. “What is the purpose of Titus Ntuchiu as deputy governor and the finance minister who comes from Tigania if he can’t lobby for a fire engine to be stationed in Tigania?” a resident asked. “I called the fire firefighters who refused to come here saying the engine is only for Igembe region. We want one in Tigania. We used acarwash machine to put the fire off.”  (edited by o. owino)
