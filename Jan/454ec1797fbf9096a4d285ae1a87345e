It is quite clear that in 2021, everyone is determined to get that extra coin after a hectic 2020 that saw businesses shut down and many Kenyans laid off from work. Media personality Betty Kyallo has raised the bar in the new year as she is set to launch a brand new high-end barbershop in Upper Hill, one of Nairobi's high-end areas. Taking to social media, Betty shared the great news with her fans, stating that the barbershop will be a 'man's piece of heaven'. “Ladies and Gentlemen I introduce to you AFTERSHAVE BY FLAIR! A new Barbershop that is going to be a Man's Piece of Heaven! Upperhill we are finally here! I’m just so excited to finally share it with you! We are located Next to Taj Towers (Baita Auto Centre),” Betty said. It is quite evident that Betty is passionate about her business venture having started Flair By Betty a few years ago. Last year, Betty relocated her salon to a new location, stating that she had stalled on making the move after corona was reported in Kenya, but she decided to carry on with the project with precautions. “I was scared because our services are very personal and so I took precautions. But looking back, I shouldn’t have closed it, we should have just taken the necessary precautions," she said on a live YouTube session, adding that she was forced to pay her staff off her pocket and it was so tough.
