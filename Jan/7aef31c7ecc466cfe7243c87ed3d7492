A woman who scalded her estranged husband with acid on the face after he caught her with another man in bed has been charged with assault. Lucy Njeri was arraigned before Makadara chief magistrate Angelo Kithinji but she denied the charge. She claimed they separated a long time ago because of the man's oversized manhood. The court heard that Njeri assaulted Geoffrey Nyebere on January 16 in Soweto estate Embakasi East subcounty. But she told court that they had parted ways because she could not stand him. “Your honour, I warned this man not to come to my house again because I had moved on but he insisted on coming. I left him because his manhood is too big for any woman,” she said. Njeri said she has made numerous complaints against Nyambere to Soweto police station for persistently visiting her residence despite her warnings that she didn't want him any more. "I have more than 20 Occurrence Book entry records against him but he rushes to the police to file counterclaims against me and no action has ever been taken. I can show them,” she said. Njeri was pleading with Kithinji to release her on lenient bail terms. The complainant had arrived home at around 10pm only to find his “wife” with another man. She allegedly declined to open the door after repeated knocking. Nyambere opened the window but she allegedly splashed a corrosive substance on his face. Neighbours told police that they saw smoke from Nyabere’s face. His face was left disfigured after skin peeled off. Njeri is said to have taken off with her lover as neighbours gathered around her house. Nyabere was taken to hospital where he was treated. Njeri was arrested the next day. She was released on Sh10,000. Hearing of the case starts on June 21.
