The Garissa government has unveiled a five-year action plan to address acute cases of malnutrition. Health executive Roble Nunow said malnutrition is a public health challenge that the county has decided to face head-on. He said malnutrition impairs education achievements and economic productivity, costing the government and families an enormous amount of money in medical bills. "The high burden of malnutrition in the county is not only a threat to achieving Vision 2030, but is also likely to impede our progress in realising Sustainable Development Goals," Roble said. He spoke when he launched the plan at a Garissa hotel. The CEC said the five-year plan provides a framework for addressing nutritional problems in the county. “The plan will develop strong and quality human capital that will propel socio-economic transformation,” Roble said. According to a demographic health survey conducted in 2014, at least 15.6 per cent of the population was stunted and would not reach its full potential later in life. In July 2019, a nutrition survey conducted showed 17.2 per cent of children aged under five were malnourished, with 2.3 per cent of them acutely malnourished. The CEC termed the trend unacceptable, adding that there is a need for urgent interventions. Health chief officer Hassan Anshur said the sole aim of the plan was to provide quality, accessible and affordable healthcare services that are innovative and culturally acceptable to the people of Garissa county. Anshur said the government will strive to improve nutrition services and better health nutrition outcomes.
