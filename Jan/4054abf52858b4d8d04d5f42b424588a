Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru is among 15 women leaders from Africa selected to participate in the AMUJAE leadership initiative The initiative was founded in 2020 by former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf with an aim of inspiring women to take up roles and excel in public leadership. Waiguru has been selected in this year's cohort alongside 14 other women from 11 African countries. They include   Tejumola Abisoye (Nigeria), Farida Bedwei(Ghana), Dagmawit Moges Bekele (Ethiopia), Susan Grace Duku (South Sudan), Isata Kabia (Sierra Leone) among others. The group consists of  former government ministers, governors, MP, senior government advisors and activists. Sirleaf praised the cohort for outstanding success in their careers, exhibiting the drive to reach greater heights and tackling head on a scope of issues ranging from refugee rights, gender equality and youth empowerment. “These women join the initiative when women’s leadership is more important than ever before as countries across our continent grapple with building back stronger after Covid-19,” she said. An elated Waiguru hailed the programme noting that it has ignited her hope in her quest towards the attainment of gender equality. “To have been selected from a long list of accomplished women leaders from across the continent, is both a great encouragement to me and a fomenting in the quest for gender parity,” read her press statement. She acknowledged that though there has been a significant improvement towards the achievement of balanced leadership opportunities for both genders, much work still needs to be done as far as election of women into political office is concerned. Early last month,Waiguru was crowned as the chief patron and mentor of the 'daughters of the mountain,' a faction comprising young women who aspire to be leaders .
