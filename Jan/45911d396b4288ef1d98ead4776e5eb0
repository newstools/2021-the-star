Education CS George Magoha has again said learning under trees is best for students and asked Kenyans to stop ridiculing those using them. “For those children who are concerned, the best classroom is under a tree. And the reason is very simple. Trees add oxygen to the air and take away carbon dioxide,” he said. Many learners have been forced to study under trees due to congested classrooms unfit for social distancing to control the spread of the coronavirus. Kenyans have asked why the ministry could not build more classes during the nine-month Covid-19 holiday. But during a visit at Oloolua Primary School in Ngong, Kajiado county Magoha reiterated his December 30 directive for teachers to uses tree shades for classes. The school has nearly 2,000 pupils and since its reopening on Monday, has enrolled an additional 320 learners. Head teacher Irene Gakii said the numbers are likely to rise. She said each class has more than 100 pupils. Magoha was accompanied by CSs Fred Matiang'i (Interior), James Macharia (Transport), Najib Balala (Tourism and Wildlife), Amina Mohamed (Sports), Keriako Tobiko (Environment), Simon Chelugui (Labour) and Joseph Mucheru (ICT). Magoha urged teachers to be innovative in the use of Sh18.4 billion school fund released on Tuesday. Tobiko said he will work with the Education ministry towards the greening of schools. The team contributed building materials for expanding of classrooms, providing foodstuff and other amenities to allow learners, most of whom come from vulnerable households, to stay in school. Matiang’i said the government will conclude rehabilitation of the school's borehole in a week to ensure efficient supply of water.  (edited by o. owino)
