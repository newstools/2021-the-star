Justice James Makau has yet again suspended the Nairobi governor by-election. However, in a new twist, judge Makau on Wednesday froze the IEBC's 60-day timeline to conduct elections. This means that IEBC will begin counting the 60 days after the case is concluded in court. The commission had scheduled the election for February 18 before the Gazette notice was suspended. Activist Okiya Omtatah had asked the court to grant him an order even though there are two other orders suspending the election. The earlier orders were issued by Justice Antony Mrima in two cases by impeached Governor Mike Sonko and the current acting Governor Anne Kananu. On Tuesday, Judge Mrima referred Omtatah's matter along with Sonko's case to Justice Makau to deal with the issue of empaneling a bench. However, Omtatah insisted that that the court gives him the order incase Sonko or Kananu withdraw their cases. In the case, Okiya Omtatah had moved to court early this year seeking to suspend the election. The judge consolidated both Omtatah and Sonko's case because they are related. He directed them to appear before him on Monday next week for hearing of the application to empanel a bench.
