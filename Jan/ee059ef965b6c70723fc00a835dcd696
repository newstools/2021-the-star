A woman who allegedly received Sh90,000 merry go round cash and failed to pay as agreed has been charged with obtaining money by false pretences. Cynthia Chiyumba was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki and she denied the charges. She is accused that on July 10, 2019 and May 10, 2020 at an unknown place within Kenya  with intent to defraud, obtained  from Agness Ngugi Sh90,000 by falsely pretending that she was in a position to pay her merry go round contribution. She denied the charges and through her lawyer told court that there was a misunderstanding with the complainant. The magistrate released her on Sh100,000 bond and directed the case be mentioned next month for pre-trial.
