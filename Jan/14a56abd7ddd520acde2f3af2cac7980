A KDF officer based at a Mandera's paraunit has been arrested by DCI Butula detectives for attempting to detonate a smoke grenade at the compound of his ex-wife in Bumala. This was after detectives were informed on the incident, and swung into action where it was established that Sergeant Denis Ochieng who had separated from his wife, visited her home in Marachi and demanded to be given their children. When he was asked to wait for the wife's parents, he removed the grenade from his pocket and left it on the ground then ran away. Later when he realised it did not explode, he is reported to have come back, taken it and disposed of it in a nearby river. The military police from Hakati barracks were informed, and together with Butula detectives are in search for the grenade as further investigations continue.
