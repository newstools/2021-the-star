I confess I had never heard the name Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine,  before the Uganda presidential election campaigns started. There is a possibility I may never hear the name again for the next five years. But I owe him a post today. I like it when I see young people challenge the old established order. I can’t stop admiring Bobi Wine for doing just that. Africa will not progress unless the youth dare to dream that they can do better than the older people calling the shots. Unless the young student in university believes he can make a better professor than he gets, then tries to do it. The young business guy must believe he can beat or at least equal Manu Chandaria and tries to do it. The young footballer must believe he can play better than Lionel Messi or Christiano Ronaldo and tries to do it. An upcoming athlete must believe he can run faster than Eliud Kipchoge, Usain Bolt, Catherine Ndereba or Kenenisa Bekele and and break records, and tries to make an effort to. The youth leader must believe he can deliver better than these fellows for whom we composed songs and sang to in our school days. The older guys will treat you with a bit of contempt, then when they see you are serious, they will give way. I hope my fellow youth will dare to dream. If you can’t dream, give room to those who do and accord them your support, the future is in their hands. And I hope young people will not mock Bobi Wine for daring to believe in himself. Keep up Bobi, the world needs more young people like you.
