National Super League side,  Kisumu Hot Stars’ coach Charles Odero is impressed with the team’s performance in the league so far. The club is currently 9th on the log with 10 points from seven matches having won three, lost the same number of games and drawn one. “The second tier league is very competitive as all teams want to be promoted to the Kenya Premier League. "If you win, you go up on the table, you lose, you drop. If you look at the table, the leaders have 14 points and the 10th placed team has nine points,” said Odero. In an interview after thrashing Sony Sugar 3-0 at Gusii Stadium, Odera said most of his players are young and inexperienced. “Most of them have never played in the National Super League,” noted the coach. “In the game against Sony Sugar, our tactics worked out because we defended and used counter-attacks. We scored all our three goals from counter-attacks,” added the former Chemelil coach. Diminutive striker Godfrey Okeya scored twice with Vincent Wanga wrapping up the scores for the visitors. He said the team is facing serious financial challenges and appealed to well-wishers to help the club financially. “We don’t have a sponsor at the moment. The players sometimes play on empty stomachs hence you can't push them much,"  added the Odera. The team took the slot of the defunct Chemelil Sugar who were disbanded by the company due to financial constraints. Sony’s assistant coach Andrew Ongwae said his team will seek to bounce back when they play Nairobi Stima next week. “We played well and took a lot of time to settle. However, our defence let us down because they were caught flat-footed in all three goals. However, this is not the end of the road and we need to focus on the next game. I’m confident we will bounce back,” added Ongwae.
