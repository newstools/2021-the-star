A 42-year-old man in Kisumu alleged to have impregnated his two daughters is being held by police in Muhoroni over incest. The man was arrested following a report made by his wife and daughters at the police station regarding the matter. According to Muhoroni OCPD David Miniu, the girls were taken to the hospital to ascertain the period of the pregnancies. Miniu said one daughter who is in class 7 is five months pregnant while the second who is in class five is four months pregnant. “Police have taken over the matter and are investigating since the daughters had alleged that their father had defiled them sometime back‚” he said. The OCPD said mother to one of the daughters had separated with the father and the girl left behind to stay with her stepmother. “The suspect is in custody and will be arraigned in court anytime soon to face incest charges‚” Miniu said. He appealed to parents to be watchful of their children and protect them from such acts. Miniu said girls are prone to such acts and it takes the responsibility of a society to guard their children against any predator. “I am calling on the members of the public to be on the lookout for the safety of the girls. We also have to educate the girls of their rights and when those rights are being contravened and whenever such happens they should be confident enough to report to the police station, chief or anybody‚” he said.
