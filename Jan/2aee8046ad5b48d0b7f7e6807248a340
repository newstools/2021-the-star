Mining CAS John Mosonik has denied allegations that the national government has refused to extend mining license for Base Titanium. This follows the delay in issuance of a special license meant to prolong the firm's mining operations. The company is seeking to prospect for more mineral resources as the previous ones are estimated to be fully exhausted by 2022. Base recently shifted to South Dune, the last mining bloc in Nguluku, and are looking forward to moving to Mafisini once the license is released. Mosonik said the government is still working on the license and will soon give it out. He said the delays are caused by issues of engagement and disagreement between the locals and the firm. "You cannot push something against the community. There should be acceptability but again that is in the pipeline, " he said. Mosonik spoke on Tuesday at Leopard Beach Hotel when he launched the community development agreement committee to oversee the implementation of the 2016 Mining Act. The CAS said the state is not in dispute with Base Titanium and the government embraces investors. He said there are some things that must first be sorted out before releasing the permit. "We can't just impose the license knowing that it has specific terms that must be fulfilled," he said. Mosonik said the formation of CDA will streamline the issuance of the license. He said it also provides a proper framework on how the communities can effectively benefit from mining activities There has been a debate on how one per cent of the total revenue collected by Base Titanium yearly would be utilised and disbursement royalties. The CAS said CDA will liaise with the company and create a good working environment between the two parties.
