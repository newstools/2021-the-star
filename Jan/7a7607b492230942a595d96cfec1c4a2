Africa world wheelchair tennis qualifiers earlier slated for next month here in Kenya have been moved to Portugal due to Covid-19 pandemic. The African qualifiers, traditionally held in Kenya every February of the year, will this time round be held in May and will be combined with European.

In an interview, Munuve was optimistic of the country's chances to qualify this time round. “We have come close a couple of times, having finished third in the past two years," added Munuve. However, Ndenga said they can't afford to underestimate the rest of the competition for the event. “This year will be different considering both the Africana and European teams are chasing qualifying slots,” he added.
