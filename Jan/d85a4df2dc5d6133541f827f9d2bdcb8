The Directorate of Public Prosecutions has directed the prosecution of 15 police officers and six Busia county enforcement officers over assault during Covid-19 curfew operations. This follows an investigation by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority into an incident that happened in Nambale town on March 30, 2020. Ipoa chairperson Anne Makori said the authority learned of the incident in which police allegedly lobbed teargas canisters into a private home and seriously assaulted the owner - Benard Orenga - his wife, children and neighbours afterwards. “Ipoa immediately launched investigations into the matter. On finalising of the investigations and upon independent review and concurrence with Ipoa’s recommendations, the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that 15 Police Officers and six County enforcement officers attached to Nambale sub- county who were assigned police duties be charged in court,” she said. Their charges will include assault causing actual bodily harm, malicious damage to property and attempting to injure by an explosive substance. Additionally, the Ward Commander who led the operation will also be charged with the additional offence of negligence in the discharge of official duty. The officers are set to take plea on February 1 in Bungoma. The authority is still investigating incidents that happened during the curfew and has since charged some individucals. They include the incident that happened in Huruma, Nairobi where a 13-yearold boy - Yasin Moyo - was shot dead as he was on his home balcony by police who were enforcing the curfew.
