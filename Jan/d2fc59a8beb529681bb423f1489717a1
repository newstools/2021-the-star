More than 300 learners from Tonga Omonuri Boarding Primary School in Nyamaiya ward will spend the night in the cold after their dormitory went up on flames on Wednesday evening. The fire started about 7.45pm when learners were in their classes for evening studies. No learner was injured. Area Chief Livingston Mabuka said the children are safe and parents should not fear. "We wish to call our parents to be calm as the authorities establish the cause if the fire; we will try to get an alternative place where the learners will spend the night," Mabuka said. The county fire department and residents contained the fire. A section of the boys dormitory caught fire before it spread to the girls section. Investigations have started to establish the cause of the fire, but it is suspected it was caused by an electric fault.
