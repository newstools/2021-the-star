Three people died of Covid-19 on Thursday as the caseload hit 98,693 with 138 more people testing positive. The cases on Thursday were from a sample size of 4,526, representing a positivity rate of 3.04 per cent. The rate was 2.4 per cent on Wednesday. The Health Ministry warned on Wednesday it won’t be relaxing the virus containment measures in place despite the curve showing to be flattening. The World Health Organisation recommends that for a curve to be seen as having been flattened, a country should record a positivity rate of below five per cent for at least 14 days. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said despite the positivity rate being relatively low in the past few weeks, the government is putting into consideration other factors such as the reopening of schools. “Under normal circumstances, and given the positivity rate we have been experiencing over the last one or two weeks we would be thinking about the declaration of a flattened curve,” Kagwe said. “However we cannot do so at the moment because we have not quite taken into consideration the impact of the holiday season as well as the effects of reopening of our schools so, for now, we will be retaining the containment measures that we have such as the curfew.” Some 266 patients recovered from the virus, 251 from the home-based care programme and 315 from hospitals. Recoveries so far are 81,933. As at Thursday, 680 patients were admitted in various health facilities, while 1,730 were under the home-based care and isolation. Similarly, there were 26 patients under ICU, 17 of whom were on ventilator support and eight on supplemental oxygen while one was under observation. Another 16 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen out of whom 13 were in the general wards and three in the high dependency unit.
