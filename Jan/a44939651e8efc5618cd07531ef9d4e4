Controversial businesswoman Joyce Akinyi has lost a bid to have orders seizing her two motor vehicles set aside. Her vehicles were seized after an order by Justice Mumbi Ngugi following an application by the Assets Recovery Agency. The agency told the court they had reasons to believe that the vehicles are proceeds of crime. Akinyi filed an application seeking to set aside those orders. She contended that the preservation orders had heavily deprived her of means of reasonable living and caused her hardship. She said the order had greatly prejudiced her business, family and personal affairs. She contended that the Assets Recovery Agency had not availed or demonstrated any reasonable grounds to believe that the vehicles were obtained through illegitimate trade in narcotics. Justice James Wakiaga on Friday said Akinyi failed to show the court any hardship she had suffered or would suffer as result of the orders Ngugi issued. “She had an opportunity to disclose the nature of the hardship but she failed to do so. She further failed to show any link between the use of the said motor vehicles for business, family and personal purposes,” “The absence of that entitles the court to draw adverse inference in favour of the agency, that having been charged with the offense of trafficking in narcotic drugs, Akinyi will have to explain the source of her funds at the second stage of the proceedings,” Wakiaga said. The court said Akinyi could have easily explained in her affidavit how the preservation order has caused her hardship but she did not. “The court has only been asked to speculate about the hardship that Akinyi has suffered by the preservation order which could have been easily explained in her affidavit if any, leading me to conclude that she failed to prove hardship,” Wakiaga also said Akinyi failed to demonstrate to court how she relied on the motor vehicles in providing for her reasonable daily living expenses.
