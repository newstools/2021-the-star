A senior police officer was Sunday evening shot and killed by gunmen in Kapedo area, Turkana county in an ongoing standoff between security officials and suspected bandits. Three other officers were shot and wounded in the attack that happened as the officers led a convoy of cars and responded to a distress call. The deceased was a deputy head of operations at the General Service Unit in Nairobi and is a superintendent of police by rank. His colleagues and police headquarters said their Land Cruiser was ambushed as he led an armored personnel carrier to a scene where his other colleagues were under siege. Other reports said there were at least three civilians who were killed in the same area in the drama. Gunmen have in the past week laid a siege in the area causing a standoff for almost five days.
