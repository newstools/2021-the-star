Firefighters are currently battling to control a fire that engulfed Shivling Supermarket Limited in Kisumu City that started early Saturday morning. The cause of the fire still remains unknown. It is said the fire started at about 6.30 am when the security guards manning the premise noticed smoke coming from the supermarket. The retail outlet is located at Reinsurance Plaza on Oginga Odinga Street. A staffer at the supermarket said efforts to contain the fire when it started was a challenge because the doors were still closed. Goods worth millions of shillings are said to have been consumed in the inferno according to preliminary reports from the supermarket management. It is the second outlet in Kisumu city after moving into space formerly occupied by Choppies Supermarket at Reinsurance Plaza. The store’s first outlet located in Kondele on the Kisumu-Kakamega Road was opened on March 25, 2020. Chain director Rajesh Patel said customers had accepted them in the Kisumu market. He hinted at plans to expand to wholesale and more stores in the county and create more jobs. He said Kisumu was good for doing business following the existing peace. “We look forward to having the relative calm beyond the handshake,” Patel said. Retailer’s operations manager Sammy Wawire said they are focusing on satisfying the needs of clients. He said the branches are in line with their strategic growth in the next five years. “We have realised that the market is vibrant as there is peace and tranquillity in Kisumu,” Wawire said, urging residents to take advantage of the outlets to increase their income. Shivling is 20 years old. It has branches in Migori, Homa Bay, Kericho, Kisii, Nyamira and Kisumu. Wawire said they hope to get into the market and take advantage of the positions left after Choppies’ exit. He said despite financial constraints due to Covid-19 and slow economic growth, the retailer has seen it necessary to invest as per its expansion plans.
