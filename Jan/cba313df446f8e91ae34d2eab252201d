Australian Liz Mills has arrived in the country to boost Morans technical bench for the AfroBasket qualifiers in Cameroon. Speaking during her first training session with the team at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium, Mills said she was impressed with the first session. "I am very impressed with my first practice with the team," she said adding, "they executed some new plays well, and trained with intensity." She said she likes the enthusiasm and focuses the players brought to practice but noted that there are a couple of things that need to be cleaned up leading to the games in February. "We didn't play our best I would say in November, we need to clean up what happened on the court." Said Mills who was an assistant coach at Patriots in Rwanda. She said Kenya had a great tournament in the inaugural AfroCan in Bamako, Mali in 2019 and she is excited to build on this. "The last five years Kenya has grown in basketball, the skill level has improved immensely, I am really excited to see where Kenyan basketball is going." Mills, who has been coaching since she was 16 has great knowledge of African basketball having been in the continent since 2011. She joined the squad straight from JKIA. The talent in the country, she observed, has improved since she was last here in 2015/2016 as head of Zuku sponsored university league. Mills who handled Cameroon in their World Cup qualifiers in 2011 has also been involved with clubs at both regional and continental level. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) chair Paul Otula said he wants to lift Moran's to the top five rankings in Africa while confirming the move. "Yes Sir, We are boosting Technical bench," he said. Morans face Senegal on February 19, meet Angola a day later and tackle Mozambique in their last group B fixture. They need to post at least a win to book a ticket to their first continental showing in 27 years. In the first window in Kigali last November, Kenya lost to Senegal and Angola but beat Mozambique.
