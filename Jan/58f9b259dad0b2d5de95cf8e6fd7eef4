ODM leader Raila Odinga on Thursday made a whirlwind BBI popularisation tour in Nairobi's Westlands constituency, calling on Kenyans to shun the class war he accused Deputy President William Ruto of propagating. The ODM leader said Ruto cannot be trusted to bring meaningful change through his 'hustler' movement. He called on Kenyans to back BBI as it offers sustainable solutions to challenges facing Kenyans. The opposition chief also hit at the Jubilee administration saying it has failed to accomplish some of the promises it had made in 2017. He cited laptops for primary school pupils and one million jobs promised to the youths as some of Jubilee's unfullfilled promises. "Don't give youths hand carts and wheelbarrows; these youth need sustainable solutions. What is the use of a wheelbarrow in Nairobi," Raila said. "BBI will bring lasting solutions to the youth of this country." He was accompanied by area MP Timothy Wanyonyi, Maina Kamanda (nominated), Antony Oluoch (Mathare), Babu Owino (Embakasi East), Esther Passaris (Nairobi MP), Millie Odhiambo (Suba North) and Simba Arati (Dagoretti North). Others were Godfrey Osotsi (nominated) George Aladwa (Makadara), senator George Khaniri (Vihiga) and ODM SG Edwin Sifuna. TJ Kajwang' (Ruaraka), Caleb Amisi (Saboti) and Nairobi politician Reuben Ndolo also attended.
