Labour CS Simon Chelugui has made changes to the chair of trustees of the Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund. The changes were announced in a Gazette Notice on Friday 8, January 2021. Wambui has been appointed as the chairperson of the trustees of the Street Families Rehabilitation Trust Fund, taking over from Linah Jebii Kilimo (former Marakwet East MP). The CS said that Wambui's term of three years started on January 1, 2021. At the same time, the CS has appointed Prof. Grace Jerotich Cheserek to be the chairperson of the National Employment Authority (NEA) for a period of three years. Hence, the earlier appointment of Mary Wambui as NEA chair has been revoked. Wambui's appointment was temporarily suspended by the Employment and Labour Relations Court in October 2019. Justice Hellen Wasilwa ordered the suspension of the Gazette notice appointing Wambui pending hearing and determination of the petition. The petitioner, Kenya Young Parliamentarians Association, through their lawyers Mwenje & Karanja Co. Advocates, argued that Wambui is not qualified for appointment as Chairperson as per provisions of Section 10 (2) of the National Employment Authority Act. The said section is one of a mandatory nature and not discretionary to entitle the CS to derogate therefrom. "Wambui should not assume office as the Chairperson of the National Employment Authority, as she is a person not qualified under the law to be the Chairperson of the National Employment Authority" they argued. Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja had also opposed Wambui's appointment, threatening to file a petition seeking to cancel her appointment. Sakaja had said that the appointment goes against Section 10(2) of the National Employment Authority Act as well as the vision of the institution.
