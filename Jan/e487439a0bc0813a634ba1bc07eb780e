Five Bungoma MPs allied to DP William Ruto have said the Kabuchai by-election presents a good opportunity to send Senator Moses Wetang'ula into political oblivion. The five are Fred Kapondi (Mt Elgon), Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula), John Waluke (Sirisia), Didmus Barasa (Kimilili) and Dan Wanyama (Webuye West). Speaking in Kabuchai while drumming up support for UDA candidate Evans Kakai, Mwambu said Wetang'ula’s political career had dwindled and wanted to resurrect it using the by-election. Wetang'ula comes from the constituency. “The Kabuchai by-election is an opportunity to end the politics of threats, intimidation and blackmail and the only way is to vote against a Wetang'ula-backed candidate,” Mwambu said. Wetang'ula is supporting Majimbo Kalasinga who is flying his Ford Kenya Party flag in the by-election. Mwambu said they will 'teach' Wetang'ula a political lesson in his Kabuchai backyard by ensuring his candidate doesn't win. "Wetang’ula comes and votes from here. To ensure we finish him politically, we must teach him a lesson at home.” Barasa said Wetang'ula has been in politics for 35 years and there isn't much on the ground to show. He said they were ready and prepared to teach Wetang’ula a lifetime political lesson by ensuring that he loses the Kabuchai seat. Waluke said it is time the region gets new leaders who are selfless and have the interests of the community at heart. Wetang'ula could not be reached for comment, and did not respond to messages. His communications director John Mondo promised to respond later.
