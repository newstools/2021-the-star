Former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero has claimed a majority of Nairobians voted him to serve them for the second term but IEBC did not declare him the winner. Speaking on Sunday during a thanksgiving ceremony at Homa Bay Anglican Church, Kidero said he could not file election petition because he knew Sonko was not going to manage Nairobi. “I knew Sonko was headed nowhere in managing Nairobi. I would have wasted money and resources in filing a petition for the gubernatorial race,” he said. Kidero who served as governor between 2013 and 2017 was defeated by Mike Sonko in the 2017 general elections when he was seeking his second term in office. Sonko has since been impeached as Nairobi governor. The former governor said he tried his best in running and managing Nairobi despite the numerous challenges he faced. Kidero said his administration laid a good foundation for the transformation of the city. He argued there was a need to elect leaders with passion and experience. The former county boss said governorship requires a leader who drives for results and transformation of people’s lives. Kidero who wants the Homa Bay governor seat in 2022 asked residents to choose leaders with good reputations. “There is need to vote in a leader who will ensure the economy of this county grows,” Kidero said. The seat has attracted several candidates including businessman Jared Otieno,  Homa Bay Woman Rep Gladys Wanga,  Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata, former Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga,  Kuppet secretary-general Akelo Misori, ODM National Chairman John Mbadi and  Homa Bay County Secretary Isaiah Ogwe. He was accompanied by former Homa Bay CECM for trade Carilus Ademba, businessman Mark Matunga, former Kibiri MCA Kennedy Ondiek and former governor aspirant Enosh Bolo  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
