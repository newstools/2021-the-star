President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to the family of NYS director general Matilda Sakwa following the death of her mother Florence Oyiela. Oyiela, a retired teacher, passed away on Tuesday while receiving treatment at a Nairobi hospital. In his message of comfort and encouragement, Uhuru mourned Oyiela as a highly accomplished teacher who contributed immensely to the growth of the education sector in the country. “Mwalimu Florence had a big impact in the education sector as she taught very many prominent personalities. She also ensured that all her children attained the highest level of education,” Uhuru noted on Wednesday. Oyiela, a teacher of English, taught in several schools over the years among them Lwak Girls, Kisumu Technical, Mutuini Secondary School, Dagoretti High and Ofafa Jericho High before retiring. The head of state said Oyiela will be missed by many Kenyans especially the girls and women she mentored. “My deepest condolences to the family, friends and relatives of Mama Florence Sakwa for the loss. My thoughts and prayers are with you at this difficult time of mourning. “It is my prayer that the Almighty God will give you the strength and courage to bear the loss,” Uhuru said.
