A 17-year-old boy has been arrested as the main suspect alongside nine others in the torching of a dormitory at Kiambere Secondary School in Embu County. DCI boss George Kinoti said the suspect was arrested following an identification parade, after detectives discovered that he had prior to the incident, sent a pupil from a neighbouring primary school to buy him a matchbox. "The suspect is cooperating well with our investigators and so far, he has revealed names of nine other students with whom they executed the treacherous act," Kinoti said. The students all aged between 15 and 19  have been placed in custody at Kiritiri Police Station and will be arraigned at Siakago Law Courts today, to answer to their crimes. Kinoti has cautioned other students harbouring similar intentions to seek alternative problem-solving mechanisms. On Monday, Kinoti issued a warning to students involved in criminal activities while in school. DCI said that it is archiving and consolidating charges that may be preferred against students involved in crime. “Let each student be informed that it will automatically be reflected on the Police Clearance Certificate (Certificate of Good Conduct) when such a student will apply for one,” DCI said. “This will be a permanent criminal mark that will bar many students from achieving their goals as no employer of worth will dare employ such characters.” The crimes mentioned include armed and unpeaceful demonstrations, arson, drugs, cyberbullying, assault of any degree, drunkenness, or any reported crime of any kind.
