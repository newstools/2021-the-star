Nyamira doctors have signed an agreement to end a four-month strike that had grounded services. The truce was reached after Governor Amos Nyaribo promised to implement all the pending issues which the medics cited before returning to work. Among the matters that the medical professionals had disagreed on included stagnated promotions, victimization of those who participated in previous industrial strikes and payment of salaries accrued from promotions that were effected in 2017. "Following the conclusion of the negotiations between KMPDU and the County Government of Nyamira over the strike by the doctors which commenced on September 15, 2020, it has now been agreed that the Union commits to withdraw all cases against the county or any of its officers from the Employment and Labour Relations Court immediately," read part of the return-to-work formula agreement. The agreement was signed by Nyaribo, County Secretary James Ntabo, Health Chief Officer Jack Magara, Public Administration Chief Officer Christine Ogechi and Lake Region officials of KMPDU Dr Lameck Omweri (Secretary), Kevin Osuri(Chairman) and Hanson Ong'uti (Liaison). The parties agreed that all doctors should resume duty immediately or not later than Thursday this week at 8am.
