Kanu officials and supporters on Sunday denounced pro-DP Ruto youth who blocked Kanu chairman Gideon Moi from receiving blessings of the Talai elders from Nandi. Terming the act on Saturday morning backward and uncivilised, they urged youth to apologise to the community for the "ugly incident" they caused. Led by Chepalungu branch treasurer David Sanga, they said all leaders from the community were free to meet the Talai elders to seek blessings, so no one should be stopped for any reason. Addressing the press in Bomet on Sunday, the group also accused particular but unspecified politicians of sponsoring the youth to block Moi from visiting the elders. “Every leader is free to meet the elders to seek anointment and no one has been assigned the role of a gatekeeper. What we witnessed was unfortunate and those responsible must apologise not only to Moi but also to the entire Kalenjin community,” Sanga said. He said despite the political differences between Moi and Deputy President William Ruto, who both want to run for president in 2022, there is no cause for supporters to engage in "unnecessary sideshows". He said the two have equal chances, hence, their supporters should allow them to compete freely on their own. Gilbert Koskei, the party’s Bomet East secretary, said Moi had been invited by the elders so it was wrong for individuals with own interests to thwart the, He said neither political leaders nor youth have any role in determining who meets elders - meetings are at the discretion of elders only. Moi had to personally calm down the youth and tell them he had the right to visit, like any other Kenyan. Last year DP Ruto met the elders who blessed him as the Kalenjin spokesman and leader.
