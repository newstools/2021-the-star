Never let humanity stand in the way of political advancement. More than 15 aspirants have defied a request by Deputy President William Ruto and other leaders to let widow Lucy Chomba run unopposed for the seat of MCA Peter Chomba. He died of Covid-19 two months ago. The by-election will be held on March 4. Ruto, Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi had all requested at Chomba's burial that the widow not be opposed. “Sometimes it’s good to be human. Those who may be interested in the seat should hold on and allow her to take over for remaining  short period, then they can compete properly in 2022," Ruto said. Mandago and Sudi had made the same suggestion and asked possible successors to hold off. However, some youthful aspirants have teamed up to back one of them and asked Ruto, Mandago and Sudi to let the people of Huruma choose their own leader. “We are aware of the request by the DP and others but with due respect we urge them to let the people of Huruma elect someone of their choice," businessman Samson 'Samkiz' Wanjama said. He was expected to be a main contender but his name was mentioned at the funeral as one of those who should not vie in honour of Chomba. Samkiz is backing Kimani Wanjohi who says he will not seek a Jubilee ticket. Other aspirants include Lucy Njamba, Oliver Kibor and ANC’s Saina Nechu. They are seeking tickets for CCM, Ford Kenya, ODM, Kanu and other parties. Huruma ward is one of Rift Valley's most populous, with more than 30,000 registered voters. Chomba had represented the area three times, including once as a councillor. Jubilee will hold primaries to nominate a candidate for the March 4 by-election. Chomba’s widow has a head start because of the sympathy vote and support by the DP and others. (Edited by V. Graham)
