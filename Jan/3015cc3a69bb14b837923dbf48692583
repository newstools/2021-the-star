More Kenyans prefer a multiple-choice referendum in the looming Building Bridges Initiative referendum, a new survey shows. The poll by research firm Tifa shows that 46 per cent of Kenyans prefer to vote  ‘YES’ or ‘NO’ on each specific proposal. This is the same model preferred by Deputy President William Ruto and his political brigade. The poll also shows that 37 per cent of Kenyans prefer to vote ‘YES’ or ‘NO’ for the entire set of proposals in one go. 16 per cent of are not sure. Ruto and his team have argued that to avoid 'throwing out the baby with the bathwater', voters should be allowed to cherry-pick so that popular proposals are not sacrificed. They have also been pushing for the referendum to be held alongside the general election. But ODM leader Raila Odinga likened the proposal by Ruto for a multiple-choice referendum to subjecting Kenyans to a confusing school examination. Raila argues that illiterate electorate are already overburdened by six ballot papers and having a multiple-choice referendum alongside the general election would be impossible “It is like sending someone to an examination. Even for someone who has been in school for 12 years, it will be a challenge and now you are asking an illiterate person to do that on the same day there is a general election,” Raila said.
