Education CS Prof George Magoha has banned the use of portable sanitisers by students in schools. The CS on Wednesday raised a red flag over malicious use of the product to cause arson in learning institutions. This comes after an inferno razed part of a dormitory at Cheborge Boys Secondary School in Kericho; the cause of the fire was suspected to be an arson. “A fire was started using a sanitiser in one of the schools… I want to tell teachers that they must not allow small-bottle sanitisers into schools the portable sanitisers, with students should be taken and returned when the child is leaving school,” Magoha said. The CS was speaking at Our Lady of Fatima Girls Secondary School in Nairobi where he was meeting a group of security and education administrators. In the first week of January, Magoha stated that large quantities of sanitisers will not be allowed in schools, directing that only about five litres will be allowed and will be handled by teachers. The CS said the roll-out of the Government’s supply of desks is expected to benefit public primary and secondary schools with a total of 625,000 desks. He also praised MPs for using CDF funds to equip schools with water and sanitation facilities. Every child in primary school will be given a nine months package of sanitary towels. For secondary school, uncertainty of when the provision will be done still hangs as the CS notes talks on the acquisition and distribution is still ongoing with development partners. Magoha also raised an alarm over absenteeism in arid and semi-arid areas due to lack of food; he said the government will revive the school feeding programme to address this. No child shall be sent home for school fees, he reiterated. “Soon the next tranche of money will be made available for capitation,” Magoha said.
