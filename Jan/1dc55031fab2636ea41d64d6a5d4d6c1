 Monchengladbach vs Dortmund, Friday (22:30) Borussia Mönchengladbach’s 1-0 win in midweek gave them a third victory via a one goal-margin from their last four Bundesliga games. However, despite that form, it’s worth noting that the reverse fixture was the only league game this season in which they failed to score (0-3) and was one of three Bundesliga games that saw them concede first. The hosts have lost only once at home this Bundesliga campaign and are yet to lose the first half here. It’s rare for Gladbach to excel over both periods though, which is why they’ve won both halves just once at home in the Bundesliga so far and have scored during both halves just twice. Furthermore, four of their five won/lost home league games have been decided by a one-goal margin. Dortmund are win-less in two matches and have struggled after conceding first, winning just one of eight Bundesliga games—seven of which came across their last 10 matches. Dortmund have won eight of nine after scoring first (W8, L1). Despite losing two of their last three away league games, the visitors have still collected more points away than at home. However, they are yet to lead at HT away this Bundesliga campaign.

They have conceded under 1.5 goals in six of those eight matches, and only two league sides have shipped fewer goals than their total of 16. Starting the game week in eighth, Cádiz can be more than pleased with their first half of LL action following promotion in the summer. They’ve opened the scoring in three consecutive matches, but conceded the game’s next goal on each occasion. Furthermore, only two sides have a lower shot on target average than Cádiz. Cádiz have picked up more wins on the road than at home this season. However, they are win-less in five away LL fixtures failing to score over 1.5 goals in each. They’re also without a win in each of their previous three competitive matches against Sevilla.

Each of Verona’s last six win/loss in SA results have come via a single-goal margin. Four of those six results and each of Verona’s last three SA home results have ended 2-1. Impressive home starts have been Verona’s forte with six HT clean sheets in their eight SA games here (excluding a walkover win). Sitting in third ahead of the round and needing a win to keep the pressure on the sides above, Napoli’s recent good form has seen them score 13 of their 40 SA season goals. Although predominantly a second-half side with 65  per cent of their SA goals arriving beyond HT, Napoli can start fast and are the only side in the top-five European Leagues to net 4+ first-half goals in two league matches. Napoli are the only SA side yet to draw on the road whilst goal-scoring remains a strong theme with 2+ goals netted in five of those six wins. Napoli have scored nine of their 15 SA away goals beyond the 60th minute. Sticking to that theme, Napoli have scored the last goal in each of their six SA away wins.
