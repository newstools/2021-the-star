Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo has retained only three county executives appointed by his predecessor John Nyagarama. Emily Moraa, Peris Nyaboke and Samwel Maiko survived the purge of Nyagarama’s executive committee. Nyaribo, previously the deputy governor, took over following Nyagarama’s death late last year. Moraa will head the Finance and Economic Planning docket, Nyaboke continues as Agriculture executive, while former Environment CEC Samwel Maiko moves to Lands. The new appointees are Stephen Onwong’a in Trade and Industry; Grace Nyamongo, a former Woman Rep, leads Sports, Gender and Cultural Activities; Gladys Momanyi takes charge of Health; and Jones Omwenga Public Works and Roads. CECs who never made it back to Nyaribo’s government are Douglas Bosire (Health), Omwanza Muga (Roads), and Zablon Onchiri (Lands). Others are John Omanwa (Finance), Bernard Osumo (Public Service Management) and Johnstone Obike Ndege (Trade). On Wednesday, Governor Nyaribo told journalists he will closely monitor the performance of the executives to ensure service delivery to the residents. “The time we have is to work for our people and I am looking upon the aforesaid individuals to work hard and ensure the residents of our county benefit from the services offered by my government," he said. The names will be forwarded to the county assembly for approval alongside that of Deputy Governor nominee James Gesami.
