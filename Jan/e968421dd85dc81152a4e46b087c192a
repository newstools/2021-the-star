The government is forming a multiagency team to get rid of illegal fishing nets used in Lake Victoria. Migori county commissioner Boaz Cherutich said they will intensify patrols and surveillance in the lake to eradicate illegal fishing gear. “We have received complaints that fishermen and cartels are using illegal fishing nets locally called amuok, which kill young fish and disrupt the breeding process,” he said. Cherutich spoke on Wednesday after holding a county security meeting. Members of the Kenya Coast Guard Service and immigration officers attended. He said the team will comprise coast guards, immigration officers and the police. “We will have thorough and sustained crackdowns targeting fishermen, traders who supply the nets and Beach Management Units who allow use of illegal nets,” Cherutich said. He said the patrol will also target fishermen from Tanzania and Uganda who fish illegally in Kenyan waters. During the burial of former Ndhiwa MP Owigo Olang’ in Karungu on Saturday, Migori Governor Okoth Obado and Nyatike MP Tom Odege urged fisheries officials not to tolerate the use of illegal fishing gear. The two said Lake Victoria would end up having no fish if illegal fishing is not stopped, especially around islands and beaches which are breeding grounds for fish. “Amouk clears all fish, including fingerlings,” Odege said. Migori county BMU chairman Jeckonia Adhanja said it has become difficult to control the use of amuok and other illegal fishing gear as fishermen sneak them deep into the lake. “We have tried controlling them and have seized some, but there are those who are still using them secretly. They have become too much in the lake,” Adhanja said. The illegal fishing net is common in Sori, Bongu and Aneko beaches which are all in Nyatike constituency.
