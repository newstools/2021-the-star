Gor Mahia captain Kenneth Muguna says the team will heavily rely on the confidence drawn from battering Mathare United last week when they pursue a third win of the season against Western Stima on Monday. Gor saw off Mathare 3-1 on Thursday to breathe life into their title defence and will be seeking to gather more steam against the powermen at the Moi Stadium, Kisumu. Prior to the Mathare win, K'Ogalo's confidence had dipped following the 8-1 thrashing by Algeria's CR Belouizdad in the Caf Champions League and the 4-3 loss to Kariobangi Sharks a week ago in a league duel. However, Muguna underscored the significance of the win which he believes will inspire them to switch off the struggling Stima and slice the gap between them and the top teams. Stima, who are under the tutelage of Paul Ogai, have won just one match in seven. It will also be a crucial match for new Gor Mahia coach, Carlos Pinto, as he seeks to get his side to perform consistently. Pinto will, however, have to do without the services of striker Nicholas Kipkirui, who was sent off against Mathare after a scuffle with James Kinyanjui. "The win against Mathare injected some confidence which will go a long way in helping us get maximum points in Kisumu. We didn't start well but we are slowly gaining momentum and every player is focused on the task ahead," said Muguna. "Every opponent is keen to beat us but we will treat Stima with the respect they deserve." Meanwhile, Mathare and Zoo FC will be targeting their first win of the season when they lock horns at the Kasarani Annex. The two teams, who began the season late owing to a push and pull between them and Football Kenya Federation over the StarTimes broadcast deal, are yet to taste victory after two matches. Mathare lost their opener 4-2 to Sofapaka while Zoo played Bandari to a one-all draw in their first match before labouring for a barren draw with Posta Rangers in the subsequent one.
