Mandera residents have appealed to Ipoa to investigate and bring to book police officers involved in the killing of one of the residents and injuring three others. Led by Mohamed Osman, they said the four were coming from checking on their camels on the outskirts of Kotulo town when they were intercepted by the officers. Osman said the victims were beaten before the officers fired at them, resulting in the the death of one of them on the spot. He said in an apparent cover-up, the officers initially refused to release the body for burial, prompting protest amongst locals. The residents demonstrated on Monday morning, threatening to torch a police station.Â Police officers had to fire up into the air to scare them away. Feisal Abdi, another resident, said they have found themselves in a hard place as they now fear both the police and al-Shabaab militants "who have wreaked havoc" in the border town. He said the incident is not the first as several people have previously been tortured by police officers, with little investigations by relevant government agencies done to serve justice. They want Independent Policing Oversight Authority to intervene and bring justice to victims before the situation gets out of hand. Security agencies have in the past been accused of using excessive force and extrajudicial killings in the fight against terror, something residents say might contribute to violent extremism and radicalisation, especially among the youth.
