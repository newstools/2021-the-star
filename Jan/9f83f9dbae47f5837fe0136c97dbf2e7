Woman representative seat in Bumula went to Florence Munala after unseating Evelyn Namusasi while Metrine Nasambu Makhapila won in Bungoma South. Knut second national vice chairperson Rosalia Mkanjala called on members who have exited the union to return. Members have been exiting the union in droves. She said for the union to be strong, it needs enough members to bargain for teachers' rights. Mkanjala told members that this is the first time branches will be working without funds. "Let the government release cash to Knut branches. Let TSC release deductions from teachers to unions for them to operate well," she said.
