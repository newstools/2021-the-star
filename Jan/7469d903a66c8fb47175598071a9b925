Clinical officers on Monday held demonstrations in an effort to have their Return to Work Formula signed. The clinical officers held a peaceful procession from Uhuru Park to the Council of Governors offices in Westlands after the governors’ body failed to append a signature to their agreement that was arrived at on January 1. The clinicians have further accused the CoG of resorting to intimidation and hostility meted on their striking members, adding that grievances from employees cannot be solved through hostility, intimidation and threats. The CoG has been reluctant to sign the RTWF for both the clinicians and the nurses, with the documents lying at the labour ministry as Kenyans continue to suffer the brunt of the strike that entered its second month last week. The CoG claims they were not consulted before the agreements were reached, a position the unions have refuted. “On first of this year we came out together with the CS of Health out of goodwill and after a lot of compromise between the both sides in agreement that we are going to go back with a framework of how we were going to address the serious grievances that concerned the working environment which was not safe for ourselves and for the patients that we see,” KUCO chairman Peterson Wachira said.
