The Busia county government has commissioned a Sh3 million solar-powered water project in Matayos. Busia Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi said the borehole at Sigomere is expected to serve more than 3,000 residents and learning institutions. He spoke at Igero Primary School in Matayos South ward. "We are committed to expanding the water project to benefit more households in this area and the county at large," he said. The borehole has a yield of 6.5 cubic metres per hour with a pumping capacity of 40,000 litres per hour. Public Health chief officer Jonathan Ino said the project will help cut the spread of Covid-19 and waterborne diseases such as cholera and dysentery by 70 per cent. Mulomi also handed over Ebwicha solar-powered borehole that was  constructed by the National Water Harvesting and storage Authority to the contractor for solar installation and pipe extensions. Water and Irrigation Deputy Director Implementation Alfayo Kihima said Ebwicha borehole is the leading in the county with a yield of 36 cubic metres (36,000L) per hour. Resident Mildred Khaseke said the water project will save them from  walking long distances in search of water. Matayos South MCA Linus Asiba, acting director Public Works John Kevin Otwani and ward administrator Leonard Bukeke Ouma were present.
