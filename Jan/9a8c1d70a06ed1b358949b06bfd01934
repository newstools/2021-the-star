Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga to support ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi for the presidency in 2022. Malala said the two leaders should leave Kenya into the 'safe hands' of Mudavadi during next year's elections. The senator who spoke on Saturday during the funeral of Mudavadi's mother Hannah said Mudavadi is the best candidate to take over from Uhuru. Malala said in 2007, Raila chose Mudavadi as his number two and in return, the ANC leader supported him unconditionally. The senator said Mudavadi replicated his support towards Raila again in 2017 under Nasa. "Dawa ya deni ni kulipa! I am urging the two leaders, the only legacy you can leave is to leave Kenya in the safe pair of hands of Mudavadi," Malala said. Malala thanked the President and the ODM leader for coming together under the Building Bridges Initiative that has brought peace in the country. Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja echoed Malala saying Mudavadi is the best candidate to take over the country's leadership and he was ready to follow the ANC leader going forward. "I won't join you because you are a Luhya, but because we want hope in this country. Mudavadi cannot do it alone. Let's work together as a team to ensure we move as one team," Sakaja said. Senate Majority Leader Samuel Poghisio urged Kenyans to pray to God to give the country good leaders who will protect it. "Some leaders in this country are so corrupt that we can't trust them," he said.
