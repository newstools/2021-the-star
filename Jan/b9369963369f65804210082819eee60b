Imenti North MP Rahim Dawood has said the 41 MPs who on Thursday wrote a stern letter to President Uhuru Kenyatta 'are insincere'. He said the legislators from Mt Kenya, Nairobi and Rift Valley claimed they have not been invited to Sagana 'which is not true'. Uhuru arrived in Sagana today for a four-day working visit of Central Kenya. “How can they say the President has done nothing for agricultural areas yet we have a bill in Parliament for guarantee minimum returns, the Cherry Fund, the Tea Bill has passed and the Coffee Bill is in process? Dawood asked. The MP spoke to the Star on Friday before he left for a meeting in Sagana. He said in every constituency there is an ongoing road or electricity project. In the letter, the 41 MPs decry the state of the economy, alleged betrayal of the DP, political 'persecution' and Uhuru's handshake with ODM leader Raila Odinga. The 11-page letter also seeks to address what the MPs say is the shelving of the Big Four agenda for BBI and also tells off the President over his recent utterances. The letter comes just weeks after Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata wrote to the President telling him that BBI was facing opposition in Mt Kenya. On succession politics, Dawood said Kenyans have a history of not backing endorsed presidential candidates or breaking MoUs between politicians. “There is nothing like betrayal of Deputy President William Ruto. Let everybody look for votes in Mount Kenya. We cannot be sold as a basket. We want residents to hear out all candidates,” Dawood said. He said the Big Four agenda has not been abandoned and instead the BBI taken a centre stage. “I have seen the proposed budget and a lot of money has been put to housing as well as other sectors in the Big Four agenda,” he said. He said the additional funds as proposed in the BBI will not be have an immediate impact and should be delinked from the 2022 presidential race.
