New Gor Mahia coach Carlos Pinto has hailed his players for their commitment after starting his tenure with a 3-1 win over Mathare United on Thursday at the Kasarani Annex. The Portuguese was appointed last Sunday to succeed Roberto Oliveira and despite taking the players through the drills for just three days, he helped the club return to their winning ways. Pinto said the players had depicted hard work in training and on matchday and called on them to keep the fire burning in subsequent matches. The win was the first for Gor Mahia over the Slum Boys in four years. "I had only three days to prepare the players after last weekend's match against Kariobangi Sharks. We won because of their commitment in training and playing to instructions. The win is a positive step towards my dream to retain the league and to qualify for the group stage of the CAF Confederations Cup," said the Uefa Pro license holder. Meanwhile, Pinto revealed fixing the defence was his first assignment in training after watching the team go down 4-3 to Sharks last weekend. "During the Sharks match I noticed that the team had a problem in defending set-pieces but I taught the boys to instead score from such opportunities and I am happy they delivered against Mathare," he added.
