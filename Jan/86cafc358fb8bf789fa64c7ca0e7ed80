Newly-appointed Silibwet Leons head coach Evans Mafuta is looking to guide the club to the Football Kenya Federation Premier League. Mafuta was brought on board yesterday to replace Patrick Amwoka, who was in charge from the time the 2020-2021 National Super League served off. Mafuta said the club, which is in its maiden season in the second tier, has the mettle to win the title and play in the top league next season. The former Nairobi Stima assistant coach said the only missing ingredient was winning mentality and the tactical discipline required to thrash experienced teams. "I have had the opportunity to watch them train and play competitive matches before and from what I saw, I can authoritatively conclude that automatic promotion will be ours to lose. "The team is constituted of talented players whom I have little to teach going forward. They only need to be coached on taking their chances and developing the fighting spirit which is key to attaining our goal," he said In the meantime, the former Bungoma Superstars coach called on the management to back him fully in his campaign to reach the top flight. Mafuta also called on the community to rally behind the team and write history as the first team from Bomet county to be promoted to the FKF PL in the recent times. "I can't achieve the set target without the support of the management and I plead with them to play their role. The team has a solid support base from the community and I urge them to continue supporting the team as this will boost the morale of the players," he added.
