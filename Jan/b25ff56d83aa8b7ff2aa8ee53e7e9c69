Mathare United head coach Salim Ali can rest easy after the duo of Martin Ongori and Lennox Ogutu renewed their contracts with the club. The two defenders missed their season opener away to Sofapaka, owing to the contract negotiations but now Ali has something to smile about ahead of their today's encounter against Gor Mahia as the two will be available for selection. Both players have been with the club since 2016 after graduating from our U20 squad. Ali said the two were conversant with Mathare's trademark style of play and their decision to put pen to paper was a major boost in their quest to redeem themselves from the 4-2 defeat last weekend. “I am happy we have managed to tie down the two players. The two understand the system here and having them back is a huge boost," said the former player on the club's website At the same time, Ali conceded that the absence of the two defenders was felt against Sofapaka and their return would steady the rear going forward. During the Sofapaka duel, Ali was forced to summon a new defence made up of players who were making their debuts with the club. Ali deployed the quartet of David 'Cheche' Ochieng, Martin Werunga, Austin Ochieng and Norman Ogolla in the defence “We missed them in our game against Sofapaka, where we played a new backline consisting entirely of players making their debuts. I have been hugely impressed with their growth, especially in the last two years where we have seen them come into their own to be first team regulars,” he said.
