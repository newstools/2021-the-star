A Nairobi teacher and her two daughters on Wednesday denied assaulting their neighbour before a Kibera court. Florence Anyango Omwalo, Natalie Siprose Oyoo and another suspect the court heard was a child were charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua. They allegedly assaulted Edith Otieno on December 23 last year along Ngotho Road area in Riruta within Dagoretti subcounty. A police report says Otieno was in her house when a neighbour knocked the door and asked her daughter whether her mother was present. It was then that the mother came out and met Omwalo. They exchanged words. Omwalo called the underage suspect and were joined with her two other daughters. They pushed Otieno into her house and started beating her up. The police report says that the attackers pulled Otieno on the ground and tore her clothes. Otieno later reported the matter to the police. Through their lawyer, the trio pleaded for lenient bond terms. The magistrate released Omwalo and Oyoo on Sh30,000 and Sh20,000 cash bail respectively. The underage suspect was granted a Sh10,000 cash bail. The case will be mentioned on January 19.
