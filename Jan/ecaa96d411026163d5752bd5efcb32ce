USA-based centre Fred Odhiambo has been included in the Morans side that starts preparations on Friday ahead of next month’s Fiba Africa Afro-Basket 2021 qualifiers second window. Odhiambo, a student at Georgia Southern University, is the only addition to the squad that did duty for the nation during the first window in Kigali, Rwanda last November. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) assistant secretary, Ambrose Kisoi said they have started working on how to bring the overseas-based players home in good time. “This time round, we want to do things early enough. We have already started working on their visas to have them here in good time,” he said. Late documentation denied Australia-based Preston Bungei a chance to play in Kigali show—a situation Kisoi said they want to avoid at all cost this time round. Apart from Odhiambo, Kisoi said the other player they are determined to bring home is France-based forward Joel Awich, the son of ex Kenyan national team forward Lynette Awich. Awich missed the Kigali show due to lack of visa but promised to be available in February. Kisoi revealed that the local-based players will assemble at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium this Friday to start off their training. “We have planned to have all the players take their Covid test on Wednesday before assembling on Friday after the results,” he said. The federation, he said, is making the final push to host the qualifiers which are slated for February 19-21. Other Group B opponents Senegal, Angola and Mozambique have also put in a bid for the event.
