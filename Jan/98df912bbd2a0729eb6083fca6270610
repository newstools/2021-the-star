Top players struggled through Day 2 as home player Justus Madoya clung to the summit in the sixth leg of 2020/2021 Safari Tour series at the par 71 Great Rift Valley Golf Resort yesterday. After two rounds of brilliant displays, Madoya is the only player with an under par score. The soft-spoken pro fired a round of 1 over par 72 yesterday to close the tough day on -under par 139 gross. Madoya savoured a great start on Wednesday when he led the pack with an impressive 4 under par 67. Day 2 wasn’t a good day in the office for several top players. Greg Snow had to contend with fifth place with scores of 73 and 73 which saw him finish on 4 over par 146. Dismas Indiza and CJ Wangai survived scares with +10 and +13 respectively. Although the duo made the cut, they will have to play very low scores if they harbour hopes of gaining top ten positions. Only two amateurs who are playing in the Great Rift Valley leg made cuts to the next two rounds. Nyali’s Adel Balala has been impressive and is placed joint second with Ugandan Abbey Bagalana and Thomas Simon Ngige on a gross total of 3 over par 145. Another amateur Simon Njogu is in joint 14. Balala maintained second spot after firing 1 under par 70. A round of 4 over yesterday saw the Mombasa rising star Balala cling to second spot. It will be interesting to see how the big names will make amends in the next two rounds. Madoya has taken advantage of his knowledge of the course to dominate the first two days. The top 25 proceed to the next two rounds after a tough day which yielded bad scores yesterday. Indiza played a disappointing round of 8 over par 79 which dipped him further below the leader board. “It’s one of those days when things don’t just work as planned. I will try to keep the ball more on the fairways and hope for the best. The second day was disappointing,” Indiza said.
