Mighty Salim's father Joe Salim has dismissed rumours his son refused to undergo a kidney surgery due to the influence of a local cultural cult known as 'Ngomi' or 'Gwata Ndai'. Speaking to the media, Joe explained that Mighty Salim did not fly to India for surgery despite the family conducting a publicised fundraiser, where they raised Sh2.5 million. He said the decision was informed by a doctor who indicated fears the celebrated musician would not survive a major operation as he was fighting blood pressure and diabetes at the same time. Rumours had become awash that the deceased was against the surgery due to the teachings of the 'Ngomi' cult, which prohibits followers against seeking medical intervention but rather using rituals. "When Mighty was set to fly to India for surgery, a doctor advised us to abandon the plans, opting for dialysis. He feared the operation would be his end due to other complications." In one of Mighty Salim's Facebook posts, he confessed to being a member of a tradition. "I will forever be rooted in this cultural cult and even when I die, I do not want any religious person to come and bury me. Those asking who will bury me, kindly stop as I have already assigned those who will bury me." Mighty Salim succumbed to kidney failure on Sunday, a day after performing on the fifth memorial day of his late brother Salim Junior. The family, famed for producing top Mugithi stars, is still awaiting a detailed report from the doctor over his death. He had been diagnosed with diabetes in mid-2003 before the situation advanced to kidney failure in 2018.
