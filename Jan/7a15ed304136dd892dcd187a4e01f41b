MPs have challenged a decision by the High Court that ordered them to reimburse taxpayers more than Sh1 billion they awarded themselves as house allowance. Through lawyer Tom Ojienda, the legislators asked the Court of Appeal to set aside the orders pending the determination of their appeal. Ojienda told a three-judge bench that the orders will make the MPs unable to perform their duties. In the case, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission and activist Okiya Omtatah had challenged a Sh250,000 house allowance that the 416 MPs awarded themselves. Justices Weldon Korir, Pauline Nyamweya and John Mativo ruled in their favour and ordered the MPs to pay back the money they received within 12 months. In a virtual court on Wednesday, Ojienda argued that if the orders are not suspended, then the appeal will be rendered nugatory. Lawyer Peter Wanyama for the SRC opposed the application for stay, saying the application did not meet the threshold for granting any orders at the stage. Wanyama said if the orders are suspended then it will be difficult to recover the money when the case concludes. He told the court that the country is going to elections in a year and it will be impossible to recover the money from the MPs who will lose their seats in 2022. Wanyama said that the money should be collected from the MPs and preserved until the case concludes. If they win the cash will be released. Lawyer Ochiel Dudley also opposed the application and asked the court to consider the public interest in the matter. But Ojienda maintained that the PSC was right in paying the MPs the house allowance to allow them to carry out their functions. He also dismissed the argument that it will be difficult to recover money from MPs who lose their seats. Ojienda told the court that MPs have a pension so there will be no problem in recovering the money from there. The case will be mentioned on March 5. (edited by o. owino)
