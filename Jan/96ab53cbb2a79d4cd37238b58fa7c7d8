The Nyanza North cross country championships earlier scheduled for Saturday has been postponed to next weekend following the death of four budding athletes who will be buried tomorrow. The championships will be held at Rabuor Primary School in Kisumu County next  Saturday, according to Athletics Kenya (AK)  Nyanza North chairman Joseph Ochieng. The four died on the spot in a road accident last Saturday as they headed for Siaya county cross country meeting at Awelo Primary School playing field. The four athletes are Vincent Oguda, Victor Okumu, Victor Tuju and Samuel Nyapola. They died on the spot after a boda boda they were using collided head-on with a bus. The bodies will be removed from Siaya County Referral Hospital on Friday ahead of tomorrow’s burial at their respective homes. Three of them were students at Wagwer Secondary school. Ochieng said Vincent Oguda, who hails from Kano was one of the best athletes in the region. He was nicknamed 'Kemboi' by his peers after legendary steeplechase king Ezekiel Kemboi. “The regional championship has now been rescheduled to February 6, 2021. AK Nyanza North fraternity intends to attend the burial of the promising athletes. We also want to visit the families next week,” added Ochieng. Ochieng added: “It was a very unfortunate accident. We lost very talented and upcoming athletes. I wish to convey my condolences to the families.” Last Saturday, Kisumu County held their championship at Rabuor Primary School while Homa Bay staged their event at Kendu Bay Show ground. Next weekend’s regional championships will be used to select a team to represent the region in the national championships to be held at Jockey Club in Nairobi on February 13.
