The Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) elections earlier slated for this month are likely to be postponed due to delay in nomination criteria and formation of an election board Interim Management Committee (IMC) governance committee is  yet to come up with the guidelines for aspiring candidates and the elections board with barely 10 days left before end month. It now looks likely that the election will probably take place on February 13 or February 20, according to sources. The fraternity held their Special General Meeting a fortnight ago, where they passed the new constitution to pave way for the polls. However, well-placed sources indicated that since the adoption of the new constitution, progress has been slow in meeting the election timetable. The committee is also expected to give a 21-day notice to the sports registrar ahead of the polls and this has further complicated matters.  Efforts to get a comment from the head of the Sports Dispute Tribunal, John Ohaga, proved unsuccessful The swim clubs or counties expected to take part in the  election must have paid their subscription fee and taken part in 75 percent of the competitions for the past two years in order to be eligible for the polls. So far, only Nairobi, Mombasa and Kiambu counties meet the threshold.
