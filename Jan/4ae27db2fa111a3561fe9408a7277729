Former national secondary schools boys’ soccer champions Kakamega High School, popularly known as Green Commandos, have set out new targets for the 2021 season. Green Commandos, who are fighting for the national Football Kenya Federation Division One league and Kenya Secondary Schools titles, have strengthened their technical bench by introducing celebrated youthful coach Hesborn Nyabinge, who replaces Francis Chinjili. Green Commandos chairman, Isaac Kwoba, revealed that his management has  tirelessly been working towards putting up proper structures for  the sake of players' development. “We want to have one of the best football academies not only in this country but in the entire East and Central African region. This will promote and elevate the soccer standards in this country as we aim to reclaim lost glory," he added. “Kakamega are chasing both schools and Division One league titles and this has informed our decision to recruit highly qualified coaches in various categories within our ranks," said Kwoba. “The quality of players we have introduced are up to the task and we hope we will have a very good season. We are, however, aware of the threat other strong teams will pose,” said Kwoba. Nyabinge is known for unearthing raw talents from the grassroots. He guided  Commandos to a convincing 1-1 away draw against St. Joseph, Nakuru over the weekend. "Together with other coaches, we will try to give our best and ensure we restore former giants glory. With the quality within our ranks, we stand a great chance of achieving  our targets,” said Nyabinge. Other members on the technical bench include Eliud Omukuywa, former Harambee Stars and Gor Mahia star Michael Otieno, Jared Anyira and Mohammed Khalifa.
