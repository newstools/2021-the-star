President Uhuru Kenyatta has signalled that maybe the time has come for other communities to lead the nation. Uhuru said that Kenya has been led by only two communities since independence and that it might be the time for other communities that have not tasted leadership to take over. "Ata mimi naweza simama hapa an niseme kuna jamii tu mbili za Kenya ambazo zimetawala. Labda ni nafasi ya jamii nyengine pia kutawala. Jamii za Kenya ni mingi," Uhuru said. He said his journey of uniting Kenyans is unstoppable. "Politics should not be based on the tribal basis but on ideologies and sober agendas that can move this nation ahead," the President said. Uhuru said those who feel tired with his leadership are free to seek a new chance through the ballot. Uhuru spoke on Saturday during the funeral of Mama Hannah Atsianzale, the mother of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi in Vihiga County. The president further said the handshake was meant to unite the nation after the heightened political temperatures that were brought about by the disputed 2017 elections. He said the handshake was not meant to bar others from their political positions as it is being propagated. "That's where this BBI came from. We wanted to solve all these political problems once and for all," he said. "If increasing resources to counties for further development is an issue to them let it be," the head of state added. The President hit back at Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli and Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala who had urged him to crack the whip in his Jubilee Party and leave the nation in safe hands. "Brother Atwoli na wewe Senator Malala, msione simba amenyeshewa mkafikiria ni paka… I’m in charge of this government and I’m in control of what we are doing,” the President said.
