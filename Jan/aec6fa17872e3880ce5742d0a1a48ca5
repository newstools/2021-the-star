Corporate trainer Hannah Githuki is using Vision Board Parties to help people navigate the Covid economy. The founder of Insideout Development is set to hold a series of Vision Board Parties, starting at the Social House in Lavington. “In a crisis, your state of mind is your greatest asset as a leader. You can’t be panicking when everyone is looking up to you," she said in a statement. "In such times, a clarity of vision is what gets you through because it helps you see beyond the pandemic." She added that her project aims to sharpen that skill. The announcement by the President lifting tax reliefs and extending curfew restrictions has raised economic concerns, more so coming as schools reopen.  Business leaders and professionals of all walks of life are being pushed to make hard choices to keep their companies afloat.
