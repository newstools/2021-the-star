Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara on Tuesday raised concerns over the lack of personnel and equipment at Naivasha Child Protection Unit. The unit, which has been lying idle for years, is managed by one police officer. Kihara visited the police station on a fact-finding mission following concerns over the status of the facility. She urged the national government to equip the facility as it was critical in assisting minors. She said the NG-CDF could not assist in equipping the facility as this fell squarely under the national government. “This centre that was meant to come to the rescue of minors was completed a couple of years ago but unfortunately is has remained unutilised over lack of personnel and equipment,” Kihara said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru termed the Child Protection Unit as very crucial to the police station. He said they had been forced to use one wing of the unit to hold minors who had been arrested for various crimes. “We have rescued dozens of minors either dumped from the streets or from troubled families and we have been forced to take them to the privately run Safe House,” he said. MP Kihara also expressed her concern over the status of the busy police station, saying the officers deserve a better working environment. “These officers are doing a gallant job in terms of security and the only way we can reward them is by offering them a conducive environment to serve wananchi,” she said. During the visit, the MP donated a laptop to the police station for record-keeping.
