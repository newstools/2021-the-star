Not even half of President Uhuru Kenyatta's supporters will vote 'YES' in the BBI referendum if the vote was held today. A new poll has revealed that only 36 per cent of Uhuru's supporters will approve the amendments to the 2010 Constitution in a public vote. According to a survey by polling firm Tifa, 24 per cent of Uhuru's backers will vote 'NO' in the referendum while 22 per cent of them will keep off the vote. There have been concerns that Uhuru's base of Mt Kenya is not in support of the Building Bridges Initiative push to amend the supreme law of the land. In contrast, 66 per cent of ODM leader Raila Odinga's supporters will vote 'YES' in the referendum. Only 12 per cent of them will not vote at all. This means that the BBI referendum has the highest approval ratings in Raila's support bastions compared to Uhuru's bases. In terms of the timing of the referendum, 76 per cent of Raila's supporters want it before the next general election while 15 per cent want it after the 2022 polls. The survey shows that only four per cent of the former prime minister's supporters want the referendum held alongside the 2022 elections. Only last week, Senate Majority Whip Irungu Kang'ata revealed that his own opinion poll he conducted in Mt Kenya, showed that the referendum will be lost in the region. Conversely, 50 per cent of the supporters of Deputy President William Ruto will vote to reject the BBI referendum, 30 per cent of them will stay away while 13 per cent will vote 'YES'. According to the poll, at least 31 per cent of Ruto's supporters want the referendum before the next general election, 19 per cent same day while 41 per cent want it after the next general election. The poll was conducted with a sample size of 1,550 respondents with a margin of error of +/- 2 per cent. The data was collected betweenÂ December 8-19, 2020 nationally.
