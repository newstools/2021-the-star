A Ugandan national arrested over match fixing claims in Kisumu over the weekend will spend five more days in police custody as investigations into the matter continue. Kisumu Senior Magistrate Wilfrida Kemunto yesterday allowed the investigation officers more time to wind up the probe and denied the suspect bond after he was identified as a flight risk. Ronald Niwagira was on Saturday nabbed by DCI officers who disguised themselves as Western Stima soccer players after he allegedly promised the premier league side cash if they lost against KCB in their Sunday match. The suspect allegedly gave the players Sh10, 000 with a promise of paying Sh600, 000 if the match went his way. The suspect will take plea on February 1.  ENDS/
