Newly elected Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) chairman Paul Otula said his vision is to lift the country to the top five position ranking in the continent. He said time is now ripe for Anglo-phone to take over the reigns of top nations from the Francophones teams and was happy that  that the country is moving up fast. “We are already the top team in  Zone Five and this means a lot to what we are doing. We want to be the team to beat in Africa,” he pointed out. He said his legacy will be to leave basketball in a better place than he found it when his terms ends and promised to work hard to achieve this. “I want to make basketball the number one sport in Kenya and with elections now over, we can now focus on Morans,” he added. Morans, he said, were a heart beat away for qualifying for their first Fiba Africa Afro-Basket championship in 27 years. Otula said this while addressing delegates after being given another four years  in office. “We are going to Cameroon for the second window and I am sure we will qualify to the next level of the competition,” he noted. He beat his sole opponent Cynthia Mumbo 57-45 during the elections held at Nyayo Stadium over weekend.
