 The Nairobi Metropolitan Service has raised concerns about the many car wash businesses within city estates, saying there is a need to regulate them. NMS director-general Mohammed Badi on Tuesday said numerous car wash stations have sprung up in nearly all the estates. "Car washes are too many even in posh areas like Muthaiga, Lavington and Karen, which should not be the case. Most of these establishments were licensed by MCAs. It is something political; a kind of payment to boys who probably voted for them,” Badi said. He said most of the car wash stations were politically controlled. The NMS boss called upon the county assembly to assist in regulation to control the licensing of the car wash business. "As NMS, we are looking forward to be able to work closely with the county assembly since it develops the by-laws which allow such businesses to operate illegally," he said. Badi decried enforcement challenges including an apparent conflict of interest given the MCAs behind many of the establishments are the one expected to come up with laws to regulate them. “It’s not an easy task because remember the MCAs are the same people that have allocated these car washes to their people then you expect them to vote and say no to them at the county assembly,” Badi said. The DG said that since the enforcement department is managed by the NMS, they will ensure laws are followed. The car wash business has been on the rise, providing entrepreneurial opportunities for many youths.  Edited by P.O
