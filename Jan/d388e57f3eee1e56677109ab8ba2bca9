Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has announced the ministry has reached an agreement with clinical officers to call off their strike. During a press briefing at Afya House on Friday, Kenya Union of Clinical Officers national chairman Peterson Wachira said parties had reached a consensus. "This is not an end in itself... but it's a journey we are taking to ensure the attainment of universal coverage..." he said. Clinical officers are to be given adequate PPEs, medical cover and group life insurance. There are plans to register their CBA in court soon. For those under contract for less than six months, there are plans to review terms. Kuco secretary general said disciplinary action against those who participated in the strike will be withdrawn. Salaries are also to be released immediately. Last week, the ministry signed a return-to-work formula with doctors. KMPDU union SG Chibanzi Mwachonda said the return to work formula was signed after assurance by the ministry that their grievances will be addressed. For instance the government assured them that quality and standard personal protective gear will be availed to them in their line of duty. In the document signed at Afya House, it was agreed that there would be no victimization of king by the parties involved and salaries withheld by counties arising from the strike be released immediately. Meanwhile, Kagwe on Friday urged nurses on strike to quickly conclude negotiations and call off their strike.
