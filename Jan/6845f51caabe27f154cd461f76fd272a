The party on whose ticket Boniface Kabaka rode to the Senate has protested at the number of other parties fielding candidates to replace him. Kabaka died on December 17 last year and a by-election to fill his position is scheduled for March 18. His party Chama Cha Uzalendao has said their candidate ought to have been allowed to run unopposed. But Deputy President William Ruto’s UDA party has fielded Urbanus Ngengele while Wiper Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has fronted ex-Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama’s divorced wife Agnes Kavindu. CCU secretary-general Phillipe Sadja on Monday criticised persons peddling information they had not fielded a candidate for the by-election. “As a party, we had already written to IEBC by January 4 and our candidate is Lillian Nduku Mwanzia. This is to correct the notion that CCU does not have a candidate,” Sadja said. He said CCU did not have a coalition agreement with any political party in the country for the by-election. “I want to tell our supporters in Machakos, we still love you as a party. I am giving you direction to activate every single network that we have as a structure. As a party, let’s take what belongs to us‚” he said. Sadja said they believe CCU was the best party to offer oversight to the Machakos county government since they had proved it. Nduku said she will do everything to protect the resources of Machakos residents. “I thank CCU for believing in me and carrying the flag to the next level. I request the Machakos residents to believe in me and elect me,” she said. Before settling on Kavindu, Wiper had attempted to nominate Kabaka’s widow, Jennifer Kabaka, a move that was opposed by CCU. Sadja said that though it was Jenniffer’s democratic right to contest for the seat on any political party, it was wrong for her to go for a party that opposed her husband.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
