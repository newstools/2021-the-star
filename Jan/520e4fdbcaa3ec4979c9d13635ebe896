Chairman Oduor Gangla said they will have to innovate to ensure the national team qualifies for their maiden World Cup after coming close in the previous two editions. "We must redouble our efforts for the Simbas and give them the best possible preparations for the World Cup qualifiers which will be held in 2022," said Gangla. He revealed that they have been talking to potential sponsors and partners. Part of the fundraising efforts will include raising Sh20 million for the Simbas trip to face Stellenboscch XV and a University-select side in South Africa as part of their preparations for the Africa Cup and World Cup qualifiers. The monies will cater for air tickets, accommodation and other miscellaneous expenses for the two weeks the team will be down south The Simbas last toured South Africa in 2014 for the Vodacom Cup under former coach Jerome Paarwater, where they finished seventh in the Southern section, winning one match and losing six. Head Coach Paul Odera termed the trip to South Africa as key. "The trip to Stellenbosch will provide us with a platform to set the bar and be at our best when the World Cup qualifiers start,” noted Odera The former international has identified three areas as key before the World Cup qualifiers — technical, mental and finances. “All these aspects have to go hand-in-hand if we are to take the big step and qualify for the World Cup," noted Odera. Odera hopes the team can assemble this month to start their training for the trip to South Africa while observing all Covid-19 protocols. "2020 was a difficult year. We had no international matches we need to make up for lost the time,” he observed.
