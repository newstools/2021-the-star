The head teacher of a school in Nyamira has asked local leaders and well-wishers to help put up more latrines and classrooms for his pupils. Tente Primary School head teacher Bethuel Mose said he has 600 pupils in his care but not enough latrines to serve them. Mose is afraid the younger preschoolers can contract infections due to the bad state of the available ablutions. The ECD learners also use make-shift structures for their classes. The head teacher said a letter to the Constituency Development Fund offices for urgent help to the institution have borne no fruit. “We have hope that we will get help from the area Member of Parliament to do more on top of what he has done for us since we will require more classrooms to fulfil the required 1.5m social distance. We are urging him to come to our rescue,” Mose said. He also said there’s a massive desk shortage at the school. West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi promised to ensure the school gets support from the CDF kitty. He told the Star his office has received information about the challenges facing schools in the area. “We will have them addressed as soon as possible so that the learners in those institutions can continue learning like others in other schools now that schools have reopened in the midst of coronavirus disease,” Kemosi said.
