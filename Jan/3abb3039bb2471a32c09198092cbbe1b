A senior KDF officer's company has been raided for manufacturing bottled water and affixing counterfeit excise stamps in Luanda, Kisumu. The officers had raided the water manufacturing plant, JG2 Hydrovisions Ltd, located off Luanda-Ramula road. It is alleged that the 'Marina Splash' branded drinking water is affixed with fake excise stamps and is bottled at night and delivered to events early in the morning. Officers led by Daniel Wanyoike warned the officer, Joseph Omondi Ochieng, that any tax evader found to be affixing counterfeit excuse stamps will be prosecuted. They recovered 50 crates of bottled water from the site. The value of seized water was estimated Sh35,000. A roll of counterfeit excise stamps was also recovered from the site. "Plans are underway to cancel the excise license of the company," Ann Irungu, Deputy commissioner Domestic tax enforcement said.
