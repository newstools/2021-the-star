The family of a man who was robbed and killed at Githurai 44 two weeks ago have asked Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai for a speedy probe into the murder. Simon Muira, a pianist, was attacked and robbed of Sh1,000 as he arrived at his new residence at around 9pm on December 20 last year. Muira’s brother Njoroge Kamande said he was returning home from a church choir practice when the gang of four men pounced on him. He said they beat Muira with a blunt object on the head. Muira died from his injuries. The family, which live in Kimende area in Lari subcounty, want Mutyambai to ensure suspects are arrested and charged. On Monday, Kamande reiterated the family’s message at his funeral on December 30 that they will not tire of following up the matter until justice is served. “We are still repeating what we said during the funeral. We shall not settle until justice is done,” he said. “We have given the police investigating the matter all the details we have, but no one has been arrested. We now appeal to IG to assist us.” On Wednesday last week, residents flocked to Muira’s home near Kimende trading centre for the funeral. Area MP Jonah Mburu and Gathumuri assistant chief Leah Kagwima said they would follow up the matter with the police. Kagwima urged the family to cooperate with the police so they can arrest and prosecute the suspects. The MP said he’d take the matter to Parliament so that relevant officers can be summoned to explain the progress of the investigations. “Our police officers handling the matter should speed up their investigations since it was almost three weeks but no one has been arrested,” the MP said. The gospel musician is survived by widow Mary Muthoni and their son Solomon Kamande.  (edited by o. owino)
