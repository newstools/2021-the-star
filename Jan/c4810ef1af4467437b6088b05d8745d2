CCM party leader Isaac Rutto's move to back Deputy President William Ruto, Kanu secretary general Nick Salat has said. Salat on Sunday said Kanu is unshaken, and accused Ruto of not being forthright in politics. Rutto, a former Bomet governor, joined Ruto on the campaign trail on Saturday as the DP preached against opponents calling for a rotational presidency. Rutto had previously played a key role in Baringo Senator Gideon Moi’s campaigns in the race to State House in the region. Salat said, “Just like any other political party, we shall continue selling our agenda to the people ahead of 2022…we shall take our case to them and leave it for them to decide." He said the political ‘romance’ between the once-political nemeses was not going to last, the secretary general said Rutto "is known to be an unreliable man who hops from one camp to another". “He is not a man steady politically, you cannot be here today, and tomorrow you are there. In fact when he came back to us I was sure he will not stay because he is known to issue demands that cannot be met by anyone hence forced to move out,” he said. He added, “The reason he is jumping from this camp to the other is because of the demands he issues to be met before declaring his support and I am quite sure no one will give him the attention he needs there.” Speaking to the Star, Salat pointed out that the decision taken by Rutto was an act of desperation saying it was neither policies nor principles that have made him join the DP’s camp but “other underlying issues.” On BBI, the secretary general said, "He is not the man in charge of BBI in the region; we have Paul Sang (former Buret MP), he has only been in the forefront about it." He further asked the residents of Bomet not to panic saying they should go for leadership and shun people who want to do business with them. Rutto who will seek governorship in Bomet in 2022 has promised to fully support the DP in his presidential ambition.
