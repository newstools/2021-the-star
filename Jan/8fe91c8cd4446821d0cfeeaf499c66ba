An MP wants Parliament to compel the government to explain how the capitation cash for both primary and secondary schools was spent during the closure duration. Enoch Kibunguchy (Likuyani) said the parliamentary Committee on Education should establish how the funds have been used since schools were closed in March 2020 and reopened on Monday. He said funds that had been budgeted for by the time the virus struck should have been used to build more classrooms to avoid challenges when learning resumed. The government released Sh1.9 billion for desks and another Sh4.5 billion for capitation in both primary and secondary schools Education CS George Magoha on Sunday asked school heads to be innovative and use all available spaces in their institutions, including libraries and laboratories, as classrooms to achieve social distancing. Magoha said the government will deliver over 500,000 desks, up from the initial planned 250,000 desks. On Monday, principals said attainment of social distancing in schools remained a major challenge for them as most of their classes were crowded. “The biggest challenge is how the students in the split classes will be taught because most schools are understaffed and having more classes means more teachers and as you are aware the government has asked all teachers aged 58 and above to remain at home,” a principal, who declined to be named, said.
