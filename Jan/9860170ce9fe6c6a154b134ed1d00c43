Teachers have been urged to allow schoolgirls who have given birth to rush home during tea and lunch breaks, so they can breastfeed their infants. Nyeri South deputy county commissioner Michael Tallam said on Wednesday that the young mothers should not be treated harshly simply because they became pregnant and have given birth. “Teachers should be giving them a chance to rush home during tea and lunch breaks so that they can breastfeed the infants and then go back to class,” he said. Tallam said action would be taken against any teacher who refuses to admit girls simply because they became pregnant or have given birth. He also advised parents whose schoolgirls have given birth to take them to nearby day schools to enable them to take care of their children as they continue with their education. "Parents, let us take these young mothers to nearby day schools." Tallam has given chiefs and their assistants until Wednesday next week to compile a list of all learners who have not reported back to school and forward the names to him. It is the responsibility of chiefs, teachers and parents to account for the whereabouts of all learners. He said the government will not entertain lame excuses from parents who are yet to take their children to school. Tallam spoke when he accompanied Othaya MP Gichuki Mugambi for issuance of NG-CDF fund bursary cheques in Karima and Iria-ini wards on Wednesday. He warned secondary school students against indiscipline. He said tough measures would be taken against those found with cases of indiscipline. “For any indiscipline case and especially Form 4s, we shall not listen to you. Your child will be expelled from school and he or she will go to school just to write their exams.” “Let us, as parents and teachers, monitor our children closely and ensure they are disciplined,” Tallam said. He also warned teachers against sending learners who have not paid fees back home, saying they should first engage with their parents.
