Turkana women and youth groups in 30 wards will receive Sh133 million in loans to start businesses. Speaking during the launch of the Youth and Women's Empowerment Fund on Friday, Governor Josphat Nanok said the loans to small and medium enterprises will improve the county's economy. Nanok said in Lodwar the process of initiating funds had been delayed for too long because of red tape required by the Controller of Budget. He said the problems have been rectified and the funds are ready. “We only have Sh133million," Nanok said. "The funds aren’t enough yet, but we will distribute to 30 wards and each ward will receive at least Sh4 million for small and medium-sized business groups of youths and women." Many wards haven’t distributed the Sh4 million to business groups because there are no existing business groups, he said. People have little knowledge about starting and running businesses, so government must train them about making money, saving and reinvesting,  Nanok said. “We must look at pricing of commodities in Turkana," the governor said."How can one kilogramme of mutton in Nairobi cost Sh600, in Lodwar it costs Sh800 and places like in Lokori it costs Sh1,000? "Where are the goats kept? It's not right. We will not get benefit from our goats. We herd them, then cattle rustlers steal them," he said. He urged residents not to dependent on free things because they won’t last for long and they should venture in lasting businesses for job opportunities and dependable income. (Edited by V. Graham)
