The Garissa county assembly chambers and adjacent offices of the MCAs were early this morning razed in a fire whose cause could not be immediately established. The 8.20 am inferno that started at the county assembly chambers quickly spread to nearby offices extensively destroying the chambers and the offices. It took the Garissa Fire Brigade who are about five kilometres away 45 minutes to arrive at the scene and by then the fire had spread. Efforts by members of the public to put off fire using fire extinguishers proved futile as the chambers floors are carpeted and the ceiling is made of painted wood. Rescuers also helped to push out of the compound a vehicle next to building to avoid being burnt. Mohamed Abdi, a watchman at nearby shops said he saw black smoke emanating from the building and out of curiosity ran into the compound to establish the cause. “On arriving I found a security officer manning the compound frantically trying to put off the fire. I joined them but we were overwhelmed by the smoke that was choking,” Abdi said. Joseph Wambua, a bodaboda rider regretted that it took the fire brigade 45 minutes to arrive at the scene. “This is not the first time the fire brigade have failed us. What is even embarrassing is that they run out of water barely minutes after they arrive. They need to put their house in order,” Wambua said. County Assembly Clerk Mohamed Santur described the loss so far as ‘huge. “We are trying to ensure that the fire is stopped from spreading further to the adjacent offices. I can assure you that the damage is enormous,” Santur told the Star on phone. “We thank God that there were no human causalities. It’s the duty of the police and relevant agencies to establish the cause of the fire."
