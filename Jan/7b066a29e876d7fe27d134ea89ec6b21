The chairman of a crucial Parliament (pictured) committee is a haunted man after he failed to steer the team to the heights it was accustomed to. The MP is said to be bereft of technically viable ideas and sufficient wherewithal to run the committee. Disgruntled members say he was rewarded for his sycophancy as his experience and curriculum vitae do not merit his being in charge of the House committee. The chairman is said to be out of his depth and occasionally calls members with solid financial assets to sweet talk them and avert embarrassment when transacting business. Has a team of MPs from Northeastern Kenya recruited professionals, elders and clerics to campaign against the Building Bridges Initiative in the region? Word in the corridors of Parliament is that two senators and five members of the National Assembly are unhappy with the proposals in the BBI Bill. They say it seeks to entrench the 'one-man, one-shilling' concept in the Constitution at the expense of their vast counties. The plan, according to those in the know, is for the multi-sectoral group to reach out to their county assemblies to reject the Bill. A two-term MP from the Rift Valley is between a rock and a hard place as  the 2022 elections beckon. Reason? The man who is said to harbour ambitions to run for governor wants to gravitate towards Deputy President William Ruto. But he fears the state machinery could be unleashed against  him should he begin to attack the Jubilee administration. The man was recently overheard telling his colleagues in Parliament how he has learnt to keep quiet as he employs a two-pronged approach to 2022. Those close to him whisper to Corridors that the abrasive lawmaker is torn between surviving the voters’ onslaught at the ballot and maintaining ties with the powers that be to avert a crackdown on his installations. They say his recently touted move to Tangatanga is just part of the survival strategy.
