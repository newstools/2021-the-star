Star golfer Dismas Indiza believes his new practice tactics will come in handy when the seventh round of 2020/21 Safari Tour Golf Series moves to Nyali Golf and Country Club this weekend. The long-hitting pro, currently placed second on the Safari Tour log, says he has found himself doing a lot of work on the range and practice greens. He added that he has been practising through and through on different courses across the country in the hunt for both fresh and tough challenges. “My practice plan is to traverse various golf courses across the country prior to any event as opposed to the days I used to confine myself on one course for a long time thus repeating the same thing over and over again,” he said. “The new practice routine and tactics will no doubt help me work a lot on hitting and putting.” The Nyali leg of the Tour will start with the Pro-Am on Saturday while the tournament proper will start on Sunday, featuring a four-day 72-hole Stableford event. Indiza, who was speaking at Royal Nairobi Golf Club, added: “In my new routine, I’m putting a lot more because my short game has failed me on numerous occasions.” This season’s Safari Tour has attracted a number of foreign players among them Zimbabwean Robinson Chinhoi, who is placed third after two wins at Uganda Open in November and Royal in October. Other foreigners expected include Malawian Paul Chidale, Ugandans Abbey Bagalana, Deo Akope and Philip Kasozi. The 2020/21 Safari Tour is being used as a yardstick to pick players for the European Tour Magical Kenya Open 2021 slated for Karen Country Club in March. The 2020 Kenya Open was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, prompting organisers — Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) — to start a new season with qualifying scores, where they are taking 10 per cent of 2018-2019 scores, 20 per cent of the 2019-2020 and 70 per cent of 2020/21 scores to count in the ranking points.
