 Bandari have parted ways with their long-serving assistant coach Nassoro Mwakoba and goalkeepers' trainer Razak Siwa. According to Siwa, they left the club following the expiry of their contracts. However, Siwa, a former Harambee Stars trainer, criticised the management of the team for turning a blind eye to the success and professionalism he had injected in the department. He said he expected the club to renew his stay after producing the goalkeeper of the season twice in succession andÂ  conceding fewer goals in the recent campaigns. "I have left Bandari today after my contract ended on the final day of the past year. In recent years, our goalkeepers have been voted the best in the league and we have made it a culture to keep cleansheet in all competitions. I expected the club to renew my contract courtesy of the good job I have done in the goalkeeping department but I am annoyed with their decision to replace me instead," he protested. Meanwhile, former AFC Leopards coach Andre Mbungo has been linked to the vacant head coach job at the club. The towering Rwandese gaffer, who left Leopards in December 2019, is said to be the favourite candidate to succeed Ken Odhiambo who ditched the club last month for 2009 league champions, Sofapaka.
