Police in Vihihga county have arrested a student of Nyang'ori High School for allegedly hitting a watchman with a rungu and killing him. Vihiga police commander Leonard Omollo told the Star on the phone the watchman was rushed to Kisumu for medication but he succumbed to the injuries. Omollo said the student will be arraigned on Monday. Nyang'ori High School managers did answer nor return calls for comment. The arrest comes barely a week after a student in Kisii High School was arrested for knifing and injuring two teachers. Teachers have complained about a rise in indiscipline cases among the learners. Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary-general Wilson Sosion said in Vihiga county on Saturday that teachers have been playing a key role in learners life. "Tell these parents we are not going to class and you will see them on streets because they have realised what we are doing," he said.
