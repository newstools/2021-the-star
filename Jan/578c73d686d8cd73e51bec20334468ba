An audit firm has asked the court to refer a dispute involving its former employee to arbitration. Ernst & Young had been sued by former chief executive officer Gitahi Gachahi over exit earnings. But the audit firm, in its reply to the case, says the former CEO was not an employee but a partner. The firm and the former boss had an agreement hence the need for arbitration, the court was told. Also sought by the audit firm is an order for dismissal of the case because the Labour court where it was lodged does not have jurisdiction to handle it. But Gachahi’s lawyer asked for more time to respond to the application. Justice Nduma Nderi gave him up to March 15 when the case will be argued. Gachahi had accused the firm of failing to act in good faith when it made variations to his earnings without any engagement. “The percentage variation of 22.5 per cent was discriminatory and biased as no other partner earnings were varied by more than 5 peer cent despite Covid-19,” he said. He said the controversial decision to change the accounting policy to increase depreciation targeted him to reduce his earnings by Sh10 million. According to his suit papers his retirement package was slashed by Sh10 million after the firm capped his leave days at 60 as opposed to 153. Also, some Sh2.8 million was reduced from his pay as part of austerity measures to cushion the firm against Covid-19 effects. Gachahi was the CEO of the audit and advisory firm from October 2009 until June 30, 2020 when he retired. His efforts to have the firm review its decision in terms of his retirement package did not bear fruit, forcing him to seek redress from the courts. He now wants court to stop the firm from distributing its 2020 income among its partners pending hearing and determination of his case.
