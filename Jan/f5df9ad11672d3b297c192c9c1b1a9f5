The main opposition candidate in the concluded Ugandan General Election, Bobi Wine, has raised complaints about the continuous siege in his home in the capital, Kampala. The singer-turned politician Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, posted on his Twitter account on Tuesday that he was running out of basic commodities since he and his family are unable to move out of the house, which he said is surrounded by the military. “Day Six under house arrest and we're still stuck with an 18-month-old baby who had paid a visit to her auntie (my wife) before we were raided and besieged,” Wine said. Bobi Wine emerged second in the election, which was won by the incumbent Yoweri Museveni. According to the electoral commission, Museveni won 5.85 million votes, equal to 58.6 per cent, as Wine had 3.48 million votes, 34.8 per cent of the votes cast. Wine had claimed that the election was marred by irregularities in favour of the incumbent but he is yet to prove his claims. Earlier, Wine had asserted that the US Ambassador to Uganda was blocked by the military as he made an effort to visit him. “This afternoon, the US Ambassador to Uganda made an effort to visit me but was turned away from my gate by the soldiers who have held me and my wife captive for the past five days.”
