Fifteen-year-old Paulson Omare Nyakwanya spent Christmas Day with his mother and little sister in Kisii. The following morning, his family found the door to his bedroom flung open. He was not in the room. One of his suitcases and two phones belonging to his mother were missing. Since then, Omare's family has been searching for him. Available information suggests he travelled to Nairobi. Two days after he left, he was spotted seated on the tarmac at Lunga lunga road in Nairobi’s Industrial Area. He had a heavy suitcase. An Industrial Area-based boda boda rider, who knows the family, was the one who spotted him and tipped the brothers. The following day, he was spotted in Naisula, Kajiado. Omare is a Form 1 student at Moi Gesusu High School. His elder brother Ezra Manyibe told the Star that there was no quarrel at home, no hostile environment nor any unfriendliness that could explain why his brother left. “I don’t know what is wrong with the boy. It is a mystery why he would leave home in Kisii for Nairobi and Kajiado,” he said. Omare's disappearance was reported at Kisii Central police station, recorded under OB number 95/20/1/2021. Manyibe said they at first thought that Omare might have gone to Syokimau to attend a party that had been organised by a cousin on December 28.  But that was not the case, he said. Omare did not attend the Syokimau bash. Every other search effort, including in Kajiado, bore no fruit. There is no information yet on his whereabouts. "So we are blank. We have no idea where the boy may have gone. We are on edge," he said. Any tips on his whereabouts should be relayed to the family through 0715052066 or 0701812380.
