Police in Kisumu are treating as arson the fire that brought down a temporary dormitory made of iron sheets at Kisumu Boys High School. The dormitory was put up as an extra measure to decongest the school as part of the Covid-19 protocols issued by the Ministry of Education. According to OCPD Peter Katama, nothing was salvaged from the fire in one of the dorms that was hosting around 60 students mostly form ones and few form fours. He said they responded to the distress call of the fire incident reported around 11 am. Katama, however, said no life was lost in the process. "We are treating this as an arson attack and we have already launched investigations into the matter," he said. The police boss said they will involve the DCI and Kenya Power to ascertain what might have caused the fire. "We want to assure the parents that the students are safe. The school is currently taking a roll call," he said.
