Kiss FM presenter Kamene Goro and Andrew Kibe are no longer friends. During an Instagram session with her fans, Kamene was asked if she misses working with Kibe, and her response was, "False… I love and am honoured to work with Jalang’o." The two used to hang out most of the time, but when asked if they are still friends, Kamene said, "We grew apart. Life happens." She also denied having ever had an intimate relationship with Kibe. Another fan sought to know why she has chosen to be a single woman, and in her response, Kamene said she expects a lot from a man in her life. "I expect a lot from the man in my life, and if I can’t get it, I’d rather pursue my destiny on my own. I don’t come to the table empty-handed, so he shouldn’t." Edited by T Jalio
