 KDF troops based in Dhobley in Somalia have intercepted a lorry that was stolen from Nairobi. The lorry was driven through Liboi border into Somalia where the troops in partnership with the Somali Security Forces intercepted it. It was later handed over to its owner. Cases of stealing of vehicles in Kenya and being driven across the border are on the rise. This has called for concerted efforts especially at roadblocks to address the issue. Kenye Defnse Forces spokeswoman Col Ziporah Kioko said the handover was witnessed by Officer Commanding Dhobley police station Mohammed Abdi Omar, the Sector II Commander Brigadier Paul Njema, and Colonel Mohammed Abdi of the Somalia forces. Speaking as he took back the truck, Paul Kyullu the director of a Nairobi-based agrochemicals company lauded the security forces for what he termed as a miracle. The troops in Somalia had in the past few days received a distress call from the Kenyan police in both Nairobi and the neighbouring Garissa county alerting them of a stolen vehicle which was tracked to a location in Dhobley. “The KDF troops working jointly with the Somali Security Forces immediately swung into action and blocked all the possible routes of escape within the town,” Kioko said. Kenyan troops are in Somalia to pursue and suppress the activities of terror group al-Shabaab. The border region has borne the brunt of repeated attacks from the militants who are at times aided by locals. Somalia has not had a stable government after the ouster of Siad Barre in 1991. The area is near the Somalia border and the militants usually cross at will and stage attacks before escaping back. Al-Shabaab terrorists have been attacking places in the region especially in Mandera and Garissa counties after breaching security zones, leaving dozens of civilians and security officials either dead or wounded. The terrorists have also been planting explosives on the routes used by the security agencies.
