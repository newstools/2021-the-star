A Githurai caretaker and his family were on Friday night found dead in their home in a case of suspected charcoal poisoning. According to a police report, neighbours became suspicious after the caretaker - Jacob Karumba - and his family were not seen leaving their house for a while. When neighbours opened the door - which was not locked - they found the bodies of Karumba, 32, his wife Doris and three children aged eight, six and three months old. The report says a charcoal jiko was found in the house and it is suspected they died of suffocation. The bodies were taken to City Mortuary.
