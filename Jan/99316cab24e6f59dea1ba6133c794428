Diamond Platnumz’s sister, Esma Khan, is under fire after she terminated her three-month-old pregnancy from her short-lived marriage. Esma was in hospital late last year and in a recent Instagram Live session, she confirmed rumours that she aborted the baby, saying she could not bear for a man she did not love. Her ex-husband Msizwa now says the Tanzanian government should take action. In an interview with Wasafi Media, he said it is not something to be proud of. "To also come out and admit it, even our government doesn’t allow such things. No reason can make a human being do such a horrible thing," he said. "If the Tanzanian government is really there, then they should take action on her. She never told me but her friends had told me she was about to do that thing. I leave it to God." At the time Esma was in the hospital, Msizwa posted a candle on Instagram and wrote, "Binadamu hawana huruma". Asked whether he would get back together with his wife, he said, "I can never live with someone who is able to take someone else’s life." He admitted that he has gotten back his BMW X6, which was his wedding gift to Esma, and that he is selling it. "She has done a lot to me. There are many things she didn’t have but got from me and took them away. She sold them and ran away." Asked if their divorce has been finalised, Msizwa said Esma finalised it by herself. "She has already divorced herself."
