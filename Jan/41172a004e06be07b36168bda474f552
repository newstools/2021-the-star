Kenya Commercial Bank coach Japheth Munala yesterday said they are ready to battle for the Kenya Volleyball Federation league title despite having had an action-less year due to Covid-19 pandemic . The bankers play Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) in Group 2 on Saturday before renewing their rivalry with defending champions Kenya Prisons on Sunday at the Nyayo Stadium. The tactician said playing against DCI in the first match will help them gauge the readiness of his expensively assembled team. "Playing against yourselves during training makes it hard to understand the team. We have not had test matches but I believe my girls are well prepared. The first match will give us a bearing of where we are  as a team," he added. KCB finished second behind Kenya Prisons in the last campaign, prompting the moneybags to open their wallet and bring in seven new players. KCB signed Malkia Strikers' captain Mercy Moim from Kenya Prisons alongside Edith Wisa while Sharon Chepchumba decamped Kenya Pipeline. Ugandan setter Sharon Amita is also in their books alongside former Kwathanze duo of Immaculate Nekesa  and Sharon Sandui and Rwandese middle blocker Ernestine Akimanizanye. Other matches will see Kenya Army take on  Prisons and DCI respectively in Group 2. Kenya Pipeline Company Estate Nairobi will host Group One matches, where Nairobi Water will confront Kenya Pipeline as Kenya Defence Forces face Nairobi Prisons. On Sunday,  Nairobi Prisons confront Kenya Pipeline as Nairobi Water seek to gun down KDF. Sixteen matches will be played in the men's category with Mombasa's Shimo La Tewa Prison and Eldoret GK Prison hosting the games.
