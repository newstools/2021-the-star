Former Churchill show comedian Owago started a fish business to supplement his income during the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to Churchill show's 'Journey Series', Owago said he was not doing anything as there were no performances. "That time, I was not doing anything so I decided to cook fish just like any other person and shared a video of myself preparing the fish on social media," he said. The video got a lot of traction. Out of that, he got orders and his business began. Owago decided to add smokies to the mix. "I sell smokies every Saturday and Sunday where we play football. I light the fire myself and at the same time, I play football. During halftime is when I sell to my fellow players." Owago also sells phone accessories.
