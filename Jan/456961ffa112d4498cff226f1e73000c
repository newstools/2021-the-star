Education CS George Magoha has dismissed projections by the Kenya Medical Research Institute that the reopening of schools will escalate Covid-19 infections. Kemri on Thursday announced that the reopening of schools could lead to a spike in infections by 13,700. Schools were reopened fully for in-person learning on January 4 after 10 months closure. Speaking in Mombasa, Magoha said schools have not been able to provide social distancing for learners which is vital in preventing the spread of the virus. He however insisted that learners are masked and will be just fine. On Wednesday, Magoha praised efforts by schools to stem the spread of Covid-19, leading to a decline in infections three weeks after reopening. “I want to thank all stakeholders that we are now going into the third week of reopening and there is no surge of Covid-19, instead it is actually going down,” Magoha said at Our Lady of Fatima Secondary School in Nairobi. On Friday, the CS said the infection rate stood at only 2.3 per cent. “Do you want me to listen to your politics or look at the facts? We have not provided social distancing to a large number of learning institutions but the learners are masked,” he said. Researchers feared that school reopening might spread the virus through communities. But stakeholder such as Unicef say there is little evidence that it’s happening. Random testing of learners in the United States and Britain show that schools do not seem to be stoking community transmission of the coronavirus. The rates from the study are even lesser among young learners in kindergarten. However, the situation of Britain and the US cannot be conclusive in the Kenyan case with disparity lying in the school infrastructure, and population.
