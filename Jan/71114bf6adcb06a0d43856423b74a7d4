Former Inooro TV anchor Monica Kagoni says she was trolled for quitting the station for greener pastures, alongside other staff, only to be taken for a ride. "I have to admit I made a mistake. At the time, I was offered a lot of money by the station and because my husband and I were going through some financial difficulties, I opted to take it," she said. "However, after just two months of working at the station, things went south and so after about five months of no pay, I quit. I felt that someone had ruined my career." The exiting journalists faced backlash over alleged hunger for more money. "The comments were hurtful since it is a time I was going through so much back home. I was broken." She concentrated on growing her YouTube channel, 'Metha ya Kagoni' ,Â mostly dealing with human interest stories.
