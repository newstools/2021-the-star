The Kitui county assembly on Friday approved the hiring of seven county executive members. The new CECs are expected to help Governor Charity Ngilu's administration improve service delivery over the next 18 months. Ngilu's cabinet has been operating with only four CECs. In 2017, Ngilu hired nine CECs but three executive members resigned and two others were fired. Those who resigned were the Treasury, Health and Education CECs Mary Nguli, Rosaita Ngina and David Kivoto respectively. John Makau of Environment and Philip Mumo of Trade were relieved of their duties by the governor. On Friday, MCAs were recalled from recess by speaker George Ndotto to a special sitting to approve or reject a report by the county assembly's appointment committee on the vetting of the nominees. The report, which was read to majority leader Peter Kilonzo, was unanimously endorsed by the assembly. The six whose hiring was approved are Winfred Kitetu (Health and Sanitation), Stephen Maithya (Education and ICT) and Samson Musila (Lands and Urban development). Others are Esther Kilonzi (Agriculture and Water), Hellenah Kitheka (Tourism and Culture), Meshack Muthusi (Trade and Cooperatives) and Caroline Musango (county attorney). Kilonzo said the seven were not only highly qualified but had demonstrated impeccable knowledge of the mandate of the position they were nominated to by Governor Ngilu. Minority leader Alex Nganga said the incoming CECs, the majority of whom are women, will solve the gender issue in Governor Ngilu's cabinet. The MCA for Miambani said after the resignation of the only two women, the governor was criticised for lack of gender balanced. Nganga said the youth, who were seen as having been sidelined, got a slot. Majority of the MCAs hailed governor Ngilu, saying she got it right with her pick.
