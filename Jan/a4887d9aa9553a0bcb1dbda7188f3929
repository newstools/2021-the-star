A number of health care workers across Nairobi health centres are set to lose their job after the Public Service Commission failed to extend their contracts. Nairobi Metropolitan Service has highlighted that health workers had been recruited by the PSC for a period of three and six months to help combat the Coronavirus pandemic. NMS Director for Health Service Dr Josephine Mbae in a letter to all county superintendents revealed that some health care workers were still working despite the expiry of their contracts. “As you are aware the Public Service Commission recruited healthcare workers to work on short contracts of three and six months to help combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of these contracts have expired or are due to expire soon,” reads the letter dated January 22, 2021. “It has been noted that some of the healthcare workers are still on duty despite the expiry of their contracts,” reads the letter in part. Dr Kibae noted PSC had renewed no contract therefore all the medical superintendents should ensure that the health workers whose contracts had expired cease performing their duties after the expiry of their contracts. In May last year, NMS, through the PSC recruited 225 health workers after President Uhuru Kenyatta announced last month that an additional 5,000 personnel will be hired as the country intensifies the battle against the pandemic. The recruited cadres were doctors, nurses and clinical officers. They will serve on three-year contracts. NMS noted that when they took over from City Hall there was indeed a shortage of health workers and many hospitals relied on locum. “We had to recruit more. The NMS has come up with a distribution plan so that once they get the appointment letters they know where to report,” Mbae said.
