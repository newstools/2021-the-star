After years of consuming water with high levels of fluoride, residents of Naivasha now want a share of the clean water meant for the industrial park in Mai Mahiu. In the last couple of months, engineers have sunk six boreholes near River Karati and are building a pipeline to the multibillion-shilling park. Residents of the lakeside town have had to make do with water containing high levels of fluoride for years. They have suffered a lot and deserve a share of the fluoride-free water, MP Jane Kihara said. The high levels of fluoride in the water affect bone and teeth development. “We support this project that seeks to supply the industrial park with water and residents of Naivasha, Longonot and Mai Mahiu should also benefit,” she said. Water CS Sicily Kariuki, who toured the area to inspect the project, said residents of Naivasha, Longonot and Mai Mahiu would get a share. “The ministry has signed various water policies and one of them is that residents of an area where water is sourced will benefit from the product,” she said. Kihara said construction of the proposed Malewa dam, which was to serve Naivasha, Gilgil and Ol Kalou towns, was shrouded in controversy. “Our youths have for years been affected by the high fluoride in the water consumed and this can be resolved through this water that is meant for the industrial park,” Kihara said. Lakeview MCA Simon Wanyoike termed the project a blessing. “The boreholes that have been sunk are located in my ward and the only way the government can give back to the community is through sharing the water with area residents,” he said.
