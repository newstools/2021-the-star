President Uhuru Kenyatta has given yet another indication that he might not support his deputy William Ruto when he told a parked delegation in Sagana that he owes no one. Speaking on Saturday when he met 5000 delegates from Mt Kenya region, the President said he is only indebted to the millions of Kenyans. “Some people keep saying I made a promise to them. No, I only have a promise and covenant with the people of Kenya,” the President said. “That is the promise I am implementing. Ask your guy why he can't allow me to do my work and keeps coming back for the baton, instead of waiting for his turn.” The two leaders campaigned on a platform of Uhuru serving two terms and supporting DP for another two terms. Saturday's statement is a complete departure from his Friday’s statement when he appeared to be reinforcing his 2013 commitment of backing his deputy. On Friday, Uhuru told MCAs from the 10 counties of Central Kenya that he has never said he will not support his deputy. “I have never said I will not support William Ruto; why do you keep insulting me? Yes, I said kumi kumi, yangu kumi iliisha lini? (I said 10-10, but when did my 10 years end?). "I have been busy with work, doing what you asked me to do. The rest have been making noise." The President has been in Sagana since Friday meeting various stakeholders as he drum support for the Building Bridges Initiative. Uhuru in another veiled attack at the DP claimed Ruto has not given him ample time to deliver and instead is concentrating more on 2022 elections. “Ask your guy why he can’t allow me to do my work and keeps coming back for the baton, instead of waiting for his turn,” he said.
