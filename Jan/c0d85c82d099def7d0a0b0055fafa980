Harambee Stars striker Michael Olunga scored a hat-trick on Monday to send Al Duhail through to the Emir Cup quarter finals. Olunga joined Qatar’s Al-Duhail SC two weeks ago. Olunga, who recently was crowned the Most Valuable Player in the Japanese J-1 League, switched his allegiance after Reysol accepted a bid rumoured to be in the region of Sh930 million. The former Tusker man claimed the ‘Golden Boot’ last season courtesy of his 28 goals in 32 matches and was instrumental in guiding Reysol to the top flight in 2019, where he netted 27 goals in the second tier. Additionally, he was named the J-1 Most Valuable Player last season. Olunga joined Resysol in August 2018 and his impressive goal returns at the club have procured him offers from clubs plying their trades in the European and Asian leagues.
