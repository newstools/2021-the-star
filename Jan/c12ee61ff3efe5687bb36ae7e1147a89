Officers from the Kenya Revenue Authority seized smuggled sugar in Lodwar, Turkana county, on Wednesday which is believed to be from Uganda. The estimated market value of the sugar is Sh40 million. The intelligence led by KRAâ€™s Rift Valley regional manager Nicholas Kinoti detained a truck KCD046V while offloading about 500 bags smuggled 'Mayunge' sugar at a store in Lodwar. It was discovered that the smuggler who has political connections had three stores containing approximately 800 bags each of the same sugar. According to the authority, the landlord of the stores is Turkana North MP Christopher Doye. The sugar is said to belong to about 15 traders operating in Lodwar town. The transporter Abdi Hakim is the main sugar supplier in the town. KRA said that the traders in the area have been in a frenzy to stock the sugar-fearing eruption of election violence in Uganda following the presidential election being held on Thursday. The authority said that the fear of instability in the neighbouring country has made it easy for the smuggler to sneak in the illicit products without much hustle since there is less surveillance on the Uganda side. The truck had the rear number plate smeared with mud which is believed to be a scheme used by the sugar smuggler and the front one plucked out to conceal identity. Three stores and the truck were placed under 24-hour security surveillance by police officers.
