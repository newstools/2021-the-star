The government has established a police station in Isiolo South constituency to end insecurity in the new Eldera division. Garbatula deputy county commissioner Stephen Nyakundi said that the station was built through funding from the NG-CDF, Isiolo South constituency. A Rapid Deployment Unit station will be constructed at Korbesa in a bid to improve security in the area. The deputy county commissioner urged area residents who had fled their homes due to insecurity from conflicts over pasture and water to return since calm has been restored. He directed chiefs and their assistants to make sure their people have settled back in the manyattas since peace initiatives were under way, with the elders and political leadership involved. The administrator said that security agents were on high alert to ensure the peopleâ€™s lives and property were safeguarded, adding that cases of youth in Kinna being involved in drugs smuggling, poaching and human trafficking were also under close watch. Nyakundi appealed to the Isiolo, Garissa and Wajir legislators to embark on promoting peace and harmony along near their county boundaries where frequent attacks are staged following differences over water and pasture. He urged all leaders to call upon their people to practise restraint whenever an attack occurs to avoid escalation of bloody conflicts. He further urged politicians to shun inciting their people to violence whenever there was tension, but instead advise them to stick to the rules imposed by the water and grazing committees.
