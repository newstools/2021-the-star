Media personality Anita Nderu says people should not be concerned about what others do behind closed doors. Anita Nderu became the topic of discussion on Twitter after she came out. "I hope my kids never have to go through what I have gone through for being LGBTQ+," she tweeted. In an interview with Massawe Jappani on Radio Jambo, Anita said, “I believe everyone has been in love. I think it's unfair to force people to conform to what people believe is the definition of what's right and what's wrong.” Anita added that when issues about LGBTQ are spoken about, people start saying that's not in the Bible and not religious. “Those who brought us that religion have agreed to this. Pope himself has agreed,” she said. “Why would someone refuse to give you work because you are in love with your fellow man or woman? It has nothing to do with your credentials, professionalism and doesn’t affect your work. “Who someone chooses to love is none of your business. People say that's not African but the world has changed, people need to be allowed to love who they want as long as it doesn’t affect anyone else.” Talking about her relationship, Anita said she is currently seeing someone. “I didn’t want to talk about my relationship but I am with a man,” she said. Anita is currently promoting her cooking show 'The Overdressed Chef" where her love for food meets her love for fashion.
