Youths in Kiomo Kyethani, Mwingi West, plan to take advantage of a new road to establish boda boda businesses. A linkage road between Ngemini and Kavuvwani villages is being upgraded. The 20km-stretch had always been impassable but will now be motorable in four months' time. This will open up the area for more development projects and create business opportunities, Kiomo MCA, James Musyoka said. “Even during our childhood, this road that cuts across Kiomo Hills was impassable,” he said. The works will cost Sh11 million. “We also have pastors and other men of God who will also be among beneficiaries of this road,” Musyoka said. Residents have welcomed the project. Vundi Mutaru from Muliluni said it had been challenging going for sporting activities in Kiomo market as they had to use a long route. “It was a long journey and cost us more, but now that the new road is opening up, it will be nearer and cheaper,” Mutaru said. He said the youth are very happy as they will start boda boda businesses to boost their lives and create jobs. Purity Masaa from Kavuvwani said they have undergone untold suffering because of the bad state of the road. “We used to walk tens of kilometres to get services from administration offices in Kiomo but the route has become shorter,” he said. Masaa recalled how the elderly and women in labour pains had rough times going to hospital. "We carried them on our backs, especially women in labour pains, as no car or motorbike would pass through this route,” he said.
