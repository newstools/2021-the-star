Machachari actress Stella, real name Natasha Ngegie, has rubbished claims she is a drug addict. Blogs had alleged she is a lesbian and a drug addict. Setting the record straight, Stella put out a statement trashing those claims. “Let me address the nation!” Stella wrote. “A YouTube video has been circulating and rumours have it I’m a drug addict, lesbian, depressed and many other shenanigans. “I hereby declare that that is false and just cause I’m not in the spotlight doesn’t mean I’m depressed. Bloggers, please watch what you post. Kindly stop writing/releasing false information just for views.” She concluded her statement by thanking those who love her for always looking out for her. “If it wasn’t for you guys, I wouldn’t have noticed this. I appreciate the concerns you shared via DM.”
