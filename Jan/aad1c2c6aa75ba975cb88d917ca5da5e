ODM primaries set to be held early next year will be conducted based on the party register, National Election Board chairperson Catherine Mumma has said. She said members and supporters who will have not registered will not take part in the nominations. Mumma said the party has decided to prepare its structures early enough in readiness for the 2022 General Election. She was speaking in Vihiga county when she paid Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi a courtesy call. Mumma said she is in western due to the Matungu MP by-election. The seat fell vacant after the death of MP Justus Murunga late last year. “I'm walking around to engage Western Kenya professionals and ask them to suspend their activities and go deliver Matungu,” she said. Earlier this month, ODM asked its members to send applications to NEB if they want to be the party’s presidential candidate for 2022 general elections. Mumma said interested applicants must pay Sh1 million non-refundable fee to the ODM account. They have until February 26 to submit their applications. Mumma said they are also restructuring the party at the grassroots level as they wait for the submission of applications for the top position. “This will help us to verify the ODM officials at the grassroots level. As we know, the presidential elections within the ODM party are done by the National Delegates Conference,”  she said. “These delegates come from the party officials from the grassroots,” she added. She said once they are done with the grassroots, they will be in a good position to conduct election at the national level. “We are also working on the party membership register to ensure it is properly verified by the Registrar of Political Parties at all polling stations across all 47 counties,” she said.
