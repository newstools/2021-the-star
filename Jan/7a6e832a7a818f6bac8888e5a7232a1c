The ongoing JKIA-Westlands Expressway has created over 2,000 jobs for Kenyans. The President's Delivery Unit-PDU said the beneficiaries include both skilled and unskilled. According to the unit, the project has also provided markets for locally manufactured goods and services and encouraged the transfer of valuable technical skills. "It will also boost the economy through reduced time lost on traffic and attendant cheaper transport costs," PDU posted on their Twitter page. The 27.1km Expressway will be key in enhancing Nairobi’s competitiveness as a regional hub by decongesting CBD and the Northern transport corridor. The Expressway will have 10 interchanges at  Mlolongo, SGR, JKIA, Eastern and Western bypasses, Capital Center, Haile Selassie, Museum Hill, Westlands and James Gichuru. Transport CS James Macharia has maintained the project is on course to becoming a reality as key project milestones continue to be achieved. Macharia said the road which is being done by the  China Road and Bridge Corporation- CRBC is expected to be completed by December 2021 as opposed to the initial timeline of December 2022. On completion, motorists plying the Sh62 billion highway will be charged between Sh200 to Sh300 in toll fees. The toll charges will be kept in a special fund to finance maintenance of the highways and repayment of other roads built by private contractors but fail to generate enough funds to pay investors due to a low number of users. The Kenya National Highways Authority- Kenha Director-General Peter Mundinia said upon completion the road will see motorists take only 20 minutes to drive across the city from Mlolongo to Rironi near Limuru, through Westlands. The China Road and Bridge Corporation was granted a concession to build, operate and transfer the project for 30 years that includes a construction period of three years and thereafter an operation and maintenance period of 27 years.
