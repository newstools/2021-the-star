Impeached Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has lost a bid to have Deputy Governor nominee Anne Kananu's vetting by the county assembly stopped. He has also lost an attempt to have Speaker Benson Mutura stopped from appointing, reappointing or dismissing persons within the county offices. Mutura had reappointed one Janet Ouko as the Education executive; he also dismissed county secretary Justus Kathenge and appointed one Jairus Musumba. Sonko in his application had termed the appointments unlawful. However, Justuce Anthony Mrima on Tuesday declined to issue the orders sought in Sonko's application and directed parties to highlight their submissions in the case on February 4. The judge further allowed the Attorney General to take part in the proceedings. The AG had filed an application seeking to be enjoined in the case.
