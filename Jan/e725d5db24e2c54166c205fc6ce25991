Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu has warned fellow politicians to stop misusing unemployed youths by inciting them to fight each other. Nzengu said when chaos break out, the legislators run to their high-end cars leaving the youths to run for their lives. “These leaders will come, use you to fight one another then immediately disappear leaving the youths with injuries and even death,” said Nzengu. He spoke in Mukong’a area in Mumoni subcounty where he attended a public participation forum to discuss distribution of bursaries across all the 33 locations in Mwingi North. His sentiments came after several incidents of violence have been witnessed in parts of Nairobi when Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga' supporters clashed. The legislator said if any politician has a good objective for the people, peace and harmony are paramount. “If the country is peaceful, development will follow and the rate of unemployment will decrease,” he said. Nzengu also urged youths to start businesses so that they can benefit from the affirmative action of 30 per cent of tenders se aside for them by the government. He insisted on peaceful transition of power from President Uhuru Kenyatta to his successor. “When the economy is almost on the knees, there is no point of leaders uttering words that could cause violence as this would lead to the collapse of the economy,” said the Wiper MP. “It is no point inciting youths to fight against each other. Kenyans are of sober minds and even when campaigns are calm and peaceful, they will still listen and vote in their best candidate". Nzengu also urged teen mothers to consider going back to school as giving birth is part of life. “That certificate is very important in life. Do not be discouraged when you get pregnant, give birth, and please get back to class,” he added.
