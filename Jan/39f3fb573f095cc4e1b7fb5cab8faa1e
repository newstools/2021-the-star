Football Kenya Federation move to launch the inaugural FKF women's Cup has been well received by stakeholders. Vihiga Queens'coach Alex Alumira believes  the introduction of the competition will give the players the opportunity to showcase their talent and help coaches scout better players. FKF announced the tournament will be played on a knockout format and shall involve teams featuring in the top tier and the Women Division One League. With the first round of fixtures set for January 30-31, Alumira said the competition comes at the right time. WPL teams will play 14 matches each following FKF's decision to revert back to zonal status. "Generally, it will enable the players play more matches which will be good for their fitness. Division One players have the opportunity to experience first hand  what to expect when they eventually gain promotion and this will further boost their confidence. As coaches, the event will enable us scout talent from the lower tier," said the three-time  title winning coach. Alumira said the Nick Mwendwa-led FKF were finally fulfilling the promises they  made in the past. "FKF are trying to honour their promises. It is a good sign of better things to come." Ulinzi Starlets coach Joseph Wambua Mwanza said his fringe players will get playing time and tacticians have the opportunity to rotate their squads. "As a coach, I think this will be the chance for players who have not had enough playing time to express themselves. The ladies will be busy and it's a good gesture from the federation."
