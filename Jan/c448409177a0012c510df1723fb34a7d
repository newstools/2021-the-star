Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu on Friday donated maize flour, wheat flour and cooking oil to more than 600 constituents to celebrate New Year. The residents started gathering at the MP’s Kiemani village home in Kyuso district of Kitui at the crack of dawn to receive the food. “Today, over 600 people have benefited from my personal donation of two kilos of maize flour, two kilos of wheat flour and a litre of cooking oil to go and make their own chapatis and ugali in their homes,” the MP said. He said he had invited neighbours from his Itivanzou home area, but more came from the neighbouring Kamuwongo and Kyuso locations. “As leaders, we must lead by example. New Year is a time to share the little resources we have with those who are not as endowed as we are. The reason I did this is because of philanthropy and my spirit to share with my people,” the MP said.
