Ghana's government has announced the date for the funeral of former President Jerry Rawlings. The former president will lie in state for public viewing from 24 to 26 January according to the communique. The burial is scheduled to take place on 27 January. The former president died in mid-November at the age of 73 after being admitted to a hospital in Accra. The funeral was initially going to be before Christmas but was postponed following disagreement among Ghanaian traditional leaders. Rawlings led Ghana for almost 20 years after staging two military coups as a young officer in 1979 and 1981. He is also credited with returning the country to multiparty democracy in 1992.
