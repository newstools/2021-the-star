Hundreds of learners were stranded at Eldoret bus park on Monday due to a shortage of vehicles and fare hikes. The most affected were secondary school students travelling to Nakuru, Kisumu and Bungoma. John Ayengo, an operator on the Eldoret-Kisumu route, attributed the crisis to the large number of travellers. "We are giving priority to students whenever there's a vehicle available," he said. Ayengo said they had been forced to hike the fare from Sh500 to Sh700 due to high demand. He said, however, there was no cause for worry. "More than 100 vehicles from our Sacco ferried scores of passengers to Kisumu and they are on their way to Eldoret with other passengers," Ayengo said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
