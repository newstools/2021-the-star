The government has faulted Mandera Governor Ali Roba for painting a picture of a county defeated by al Shabaab. In a statement on Saturday, the Interior ministry said that contrary to Roba's claims that the county was helpless in the face of terrorists, many gains have been made in countering attacks. "Contrary to the Governor’s claims, since 2013, Mandera County has registered steady gains through our security forces who have been repulsing and deterring threats to lives and property," Northeastern regional coordinator Nicodemus Ndalana said. Roba had  raised an alarm over the resurgence of al Shabaab, saying he was forced to go public about the deteriorating security situation in Northeastern and particularly Mandera county because people were living in fear after a return of al Shabaab, whom he said have occupied strategic locations in the county and the region. He said the group is getting bolder and more aggressive by the day. However, Ndalana urged leaders to strengthen the partnership with security teams to position Kenya as a safe investment destination for local and foreign investors. "The Governor knows our doors remain wide open for continuous and further consultation on all matters to do with security. Given the sensitive and risky nature of our operations, it is highly regrettable that he chose to address such delicate and complex national security concerns in the manner he did." Ndalana said. "His actions as a leader have the potential of heightening tensions and possibly placing lives at risks. Our joint interest is to see Mandera prosper, and my office remains committed to achieving this goal."
