Sleuths from the the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission have pitched camp at the Bungoma county roads and infrastructure department to unearth suspected graft cases. There was a heavy presence of police and EACC officers at the offices on Tuesday, with most county staff keeping off the compound. The Star has reliably learnt from the investigators that at least three senior officers in the department were arrested. They recorded statements with the EACC. They include the procurement officer, an administrator and an accountant. The detectives were said to be investigating a company associated with a brother to Governor Wycliffe Wangamati. Fastec Construction and Supplies is said to have been contracted by the county government between 2018-19 to construct the Chebosi-Weneloba road in Bokoli ward at a cost of Sh7.8 million. Trouble started when the public raised the matter with the EACC and called forÂ  investigations. In a letter seen by the Star, two residents Jack Munialo and Nyukuri Barasa had flagged integrity issues in the contract. "The company did not qualify to get jobs in the county and used dubious means to get the tender ," the duo's letter says. The EACC immediately called for the termination of the contract and directed that no payment is made to the company. A source within the investigation team told the Star that even after the firm was blacklisted, the roads department went ahead and awarded the same firm the Kimama bridge in Chesikaki/Cheptais ward at a cost of Sh28 million. The project was commissioned by Wangamati in December. "The above is the reason the staff at the roads department who were members of the two evaluation committees were detained to record fresh statements after playing hide and seek with EACC sleuths for a week now," the source said. EACC is said to have issued summons but they never appeared. Speaking to the Star on phone, EACC regional boss Tom Amoro declined to comment on the matter. " I have no comment for now ," he said.
