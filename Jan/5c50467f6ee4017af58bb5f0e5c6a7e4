Businesses in Luanda, Vihiga County are reporting low sales despite peak time as schools resume sessions after a long Covid-19 break. A spot check by the Star yesterday revealed that daily sales at most premises have remained below 10 per cent, with most traders who had stocked for the season worried that they might run into losses. William Buradi, a box maker within Luanda Market said most of the parents who turned up were seeking repair services as opposed to new purchases. He said most repairs go at either Sh50, 100 or 200 depending on the nature of repair needed. “Most of our stock is intact, with sales remaining below 10 per cent,” Buradi said. The proprietor of Luanda Best Books, a wholesaler in the town, David Okoba said his sales have dropped compared to other back to school seasons. He has blamed the Covid-19 pandemic, which has hit hard households, reducing disposable income for parents, hurting their purchasing power. “During the back-to-school period parents flood here for books, dictionaries, bibles and other stationeries for schools,” he said. There have also been near zero orders by schools which he traditionally supplies. “Even previous orders that we had supplied, most schools have not paid,” he said. This has affected orders from his main suppliers. Elsewhere, school uniform dealers have turned to face masks to bridge the profit drop occasioned by low demand. Miloko Uniform Center owner told the Star most parents are only turning up for socks and repairs.
