Msambweni MP Feisal Bader has called for unity among Kwale leaders to address historic land injustices in the county. Bader is making the call days after leaders appeared divided over last week demolition of houses worth millions at Mbela village in Diani. The Independent MP said they can only put an end to the land-grabbing problem if leaders work in solidarity. “Let’s put aside our indifferences and come together to fight this common enemy,” he said. The lawmaker said any leader who wants good for his people will sacrifice and stand with them in times of hardships. He said there is no time for blame game and instead called for leaders to reason with each other and find ways of helping the residents. Bader also warned politicians against politicising the matter. “Let’s not play with people’s lives because of mere politics. Issues of land are very sensitive and need to be properly approached,” said Bader. He said politicians must not use land disputes as a campaigning tool and for personal gain. He said he will make sure the perpetrators are brought to book as well as compensate the damage caused. “I won’t allow even for a single day a citizen not just from Msambweni but the entire county to be intimidated in one way or another,” said Bader. On Wednesday, Governor Salim Mvurya promised to end the land injustices in Kwale, saying his government is working hard to return all the grabbed parcels to the community.
