The Nairobi assembly has scheduled the vetting of former Governor Mike Sonko's nominee for the deputy position on Friday next week. If approved, Anne Kananu could potentially take over from Acting Governor Benson Mutura as the substantive Nairobi county chief. Assembly clerk Edward Gichana cited the withdrawal of orders suspending Anne Kananu’s vetting by a court on Thursday to proceed with the plan. Nairobi voter Peter Agoro had blocked Kananu’s vetting by the assembly on February 17 last year through a court order. He withdrew the case on Thursday. In a public notice issued in the local dailies Friday, Gichana said Kananu will be vetted by the Appointment committee in the plenary chamber from 9am. The team is chaired by the speaker and deputised by the Majority leader Abdi Hassan alias Guyo. The public can attend the vetting and or submit information on Kananu’s suitability for office. “The submissions may be sent or hand-delivered to the Clerk of the Nairobi City County Assembly by January 14, 2021, at 5.00 pm,” reads the notice. Guyo told the Star that the committee set the date after Thursday’s court ruling. He said Kananu's name had already been committed to the assembly last year, so the committee can proceed with the vetting. Sonko nominated Kananu on January 6, last year through a letter to former assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi. Guyo said the MCAs will strictly follow due procedure in the exercise. "We shall be looking at the qualification as per Chapter Six of the Constitution and all that the Vetting Act entails," he said. After vetting Kananu, the Appointment committee will prepare a report to be adopted by the assembly.  (edited by o. owino)
