It is now one month since nurses and clinical officers went on strike demanding higher allowances, adequate personal protective equipment, and comprehensive medical insurance cover, among others. A similar strike by doctors was resolved within two weeks. The Council of Governors has rejected a return-to-work formula for clinical officers because of the financial implications. A return-to-work formula for nurses is being worked out. Grandstanding by health workersâ€™ unions and the government must end. Patients are suffering at home and in health facilities without care. Unions must stop exploiting the Covid-19 outbreak to blackmail the government. Kenyans expected medics to stand with them during the pandemic. They did the opposite, they turned their backs on Kenyans. Union leaders have milked this opportunity to popularise themselves ahead of 2022 and suck every coin from the government. The government is not blameless. Many of the issues raised are valid. Many facilities still lack PPE. County employees suffer endless salary delays. Human resources policies are constantly flouted. County governments must streamline human resource operations to end these strikes. A solution must be found immediately.
