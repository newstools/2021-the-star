The Independent and Electoral Commission (IEBC) has announced a new date for the Machakos Senate by-elections. The commission's chair Wafula Chebukati said on Monday that the by-election will be held on March 18, 2021. Earlier on, the commission had set the by-election for March 23, but the date has been revised due to the national examinations. Chebukati said that the Ministry of Education has informed the commission that on the week of March 23, the national examinations will start, conflicting with the by-election. "To this end, the commission has revised the timelines of the by-election of the Senate Machakoss to March 18, 2021," Chebukati said. The seat fell vacant following the death of Senator Boniface Kabaka. Chebukati said that the political parties are to submit to the commission the names of the persons contesting in its party primaries before the nomination day. According to the notice that had been issued earlier regarding the Machakos by-election, political parties had up to today to submit names of persons contesting in the primaries. Political parties will be required to present candidates for the election by January 18, 2021, having resolved all disputes arising from the primaries. Direct nominations will also close on the same date; with parties required to submit names and symbols they intend to use during the by-election. In his statement, Chebukati said that the date set for the Nairobi governor by-election will remain the same, which is February 18, 2021. Matungu and Kabuchai constituencies by-elections will also remain unchanged, which is March 4, 2021.
