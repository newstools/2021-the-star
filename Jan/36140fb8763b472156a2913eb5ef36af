Singer Akothee has asked single parents not to pour negativity against their partners to their children. In a post on her Instagram page, the single mother of five said a fight between two partners has nothing to do with the children. "A mother should be the first role model for her children. Forgive and invite your partner, even if they don't play a part. Kids don't care who did what and who did not," she said. She added that whatever the reason that caused your separation, children are only interested in seeing their daddy and mummy. "Let them choose what they want to do with those who don't play a part in their struggle. Don't be a mother who pours venom or broken relationships to your children."
