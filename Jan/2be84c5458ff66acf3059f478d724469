A man who allegedly sent threatening messages to the managing director of Magnate Ventures has been charged before a Nairobi court. George Mungai is accused of sending a WhatsApp message stating that, “For now brace yourself as I claim what is mine, court battles are expensive all I need is my land otherwise I will face you like a man”. The prosecution said Mungai sent the message through his mobile phone to a Safaricom line belonging to Stanley Kinyanjui. He allegedly committed the offence on November 10, last year at an unknown place in the country. Mungai is also charged with sending a threatening message to Kinyanjui on November 13, 2020 saying that he was not surrendering until he gives him back his land. He also faced another charge of knowingly publishing false information that was likely to discredit the reputation of the complainant. The court heard that Mungai also published a photo of Kinyanjui calling him a thief and land swindler on November 15, last year. He denied the charges before Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku and pleaded for lenient bond terms. He claimed that he knew Kinyanjui and partnered with him for 10 years. However, Mungai claimed he turned against him and allegedly grabbed his land. The magistrate released him on a surety bond of Sh200,000. The case will be mentioned after two weeks.
