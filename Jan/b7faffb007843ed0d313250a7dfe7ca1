Jubilee Party on Tuesday dismissed claims that nominated senator Isaac Mwaura has been summoned by the party's disciplinary committee over alleged misconduct. This comes as a notice made rounds on social media claiming that the senator had been summoned to appear before the committee on January 18 over a number of complaints. In the fake notice, Mwaura had been accused of acting disloyal  to the party as well as advancing political positions against the party position. According to the letter, the legislator had demonstrated disrespect to the decisions and organization of Jubilee. Further, Mwaura had been accused of undermining the party leadership by allegedly launching attacks on the party leader President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mwaura who represents Persons with disabilities at the Senate has openly opposed the Building Bridges Initiative which is highly advocated by Uhuru. He termed the BBI report a mockery to PWD’s and special interest groups. According to him, PWD's are angry with the BBI report for scrapping special seats meant for them. Mwaura, said they were very disappointed with the manner the BBI team drafted the amendments to the Constitution. “We have lost representation in the Senate, National Assembly and county assemblies,” he said in November after chairing a meeting.
