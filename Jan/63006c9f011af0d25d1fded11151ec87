Members of the Kenya National Union of Teachers' branch in Kyuso on Saturday elected new faces to their top three executive committee slots. Benjamin Nzau beat Stephen Mukiti to be elected the new chairman with 268 votes. Onesmus Nzau is the new executive secretary. He beat outgoing chairman Jerimoth Mwasya. Onesmus was previously the Knut branch assistant secretary. Mutua Nzoka defeated Mwasya Mutheki by 299 votes to 171 to take up the treasurer's position. Long-serving branch executive secretary Agnes Kambua and treasurer Peter Muthengi did not defend their seats. They cited personal and domestic reasons. The polls were held at Kyuso Primary School and presided over by a labour officer Benard Mbuvi. First Knut national women representative Mercy Kyambati and NEC member Julius Taitumu witnessed the elections. Upon his election as the executive secretary, Nzau called on all candidates in the polls to put their differences aside and serve members together. He said he will serve all teachers without fear or favour. The unionist called on both winners and losers of the elections to work together for the benefit of teachers. He said he would strive to ensure fairness, magnanimity and justice for teachers. “Let us come together to serve all teachers with dignity, honour and respect as brothers and sisters,” Nzau said in his acceptance speech. He announced that he was ready to serve all justly and with respect. The new branch spokesman described his election as a stamp of approval by the teachers on his stance to fight for their rights. Nzau said he had had it rough for over 20 months after he was transferred for agitation for teachers' welfare. Kyambati told those who lost the election to remain strong as members of Knut and continue serving members.
