@alalmaurice Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong’o has been urged to build cultural centres across the county where Luo Council of Elders can hold meetings. Senator Fred Outa on Friday said the county government should allocate funds to construct a centre in each of the seven subcounties, namely Kisumu West, Nyando, Muhoroni, Nyakach, Seme, Kisumu Central and Kisumu East. Outa said the elders, who are headed at the community level by Ker Opiyo Otondi, have nowhere to meet to deliberate on matters of peace, unity, development and culture, or issues bedevilling society. “Our elders are unable to hold meetings and teachings to the public in the centres because of lack of such infrastructure,” he said. The lawmaker spoke when he hosted more than 40 elders from Kisumu West who paid him a courtesy call at his home in Nyando. He has declared his interest in the governor seat ahead of the 2022 election. Outa has been popularising his bid by meeting elders, opinion leaders, women and youths. He questioned why the county government has not built even a single centre despite having a budget for the cultural department every financial year. “You (Nyong'o) should tell the residents where those monies are being taken. Prudent use of public money should be adhered to at all costs,” Outa said. He expressed concern about the rising cases of indiscipline among the youth and in schools, blaming the problem on lack of reliance on elders for behaviour-related teachings. Outa called upon the elders to preserve Luo culture. He said the council should be supported through the culture department to nurture and promote discipline and cultural activities. “Our elders have the capacity to spearhead development in the county only if they are embraced in the running of the affairs of the county,” he said. The elders appealed to Outa to be at the forefront of championing peace and the Building Bridges Initiative in the county. Outa promised to buy them uniforms.
