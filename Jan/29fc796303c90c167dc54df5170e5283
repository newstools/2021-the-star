The electoral commission has announced an update on the BBI signature verification exercise, a week after the start. IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati said on Friday that as at close of business, 544,624 data had been captured. He said that the exercise is within the acceptable threshold and that the exercise will be completed within the commission’s budgeted timeframe. Chebukati has assured members of the public as well as the stakeholders that the commission is committed to ensuring the verification exercise is carried out in a transparent and accountable manner. “The exercise is being undertaken in a transparent manner and in the presence of accredited observers and agents of the promoters of the initiative,” Chebukati said. The exercise started on December 31, 2020, and involves converting the handwritten data into soft form to enable comparison with the Register of Voters database. The data capture exercise was launched on December 30, 2020, at the Bomas of Kenya. 400 clerks were hired for the process and took the oath of secrecy. The clerks will be paid Sh1,200 per day for the exercise. This will cost Sh480,000 per day. Applicants were to be Kenyan citizens with high integrity, with a form four certificate, computer literate, with data entry skills.
