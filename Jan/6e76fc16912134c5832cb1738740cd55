More than 120 traffic officers have been moved in changes aimed at streamlining their operations in the country. The officers are drawn from Baringo, Uasin Gishu, Narok, West Pokot, Kericho, Nandi, Nakuru, Kajiado, Trans Nzoia, Laikipia and Bomet counties. They were moved to the general duties in the changes officials said were occasioned by various issues including disciplinary matters. The changes were communicated in an internal memo in the service dated January 27 listing those affected. Traffic personnel are the most complained about group in the service because of the nature of their work. They are at times roughed up during their work amid calls for tolerance from motorists who are behind the trend. On Tuesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta said police are not enemies to the public and urged for cooperation in all ways to ensure safety for all. He cited videos he had seen where police were being roughed up while on duty. “Police officers are not enemies. They are our friends. It is upon us, as citizens to obey the law and do what we are directed to do in line with the law. If we continue that way, I am confident that our nation will be safe and prosperous,” he said. The changes come in the wake of new warnings from police headquarters on the traffic police to keep off manning static roadblocks on the highways. These roadblocks are used as money minting stations hence the directive by the Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai who wants only mobile checks to be in place.
