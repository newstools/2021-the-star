Don't let politicians use you only to sideline you when they have won election, Garissa Governor Ali Korane has advised the youth. He urged them to shun divisive politics and instead champion unity. Korane spoke during a public meeting at at Iftin ward on Tuesday. He said as the country heads towards the general election next year, political aspirants will try to bring the youth closer as they seek their votes. Korane said young people have often fallen into this trap. “The most discouraging bit of it is when a politician uses the youths as goons to cause mayhem and destruction during election campaigns. These you must resist going forward,” he said. “The youth should look for ways to build their future instead of engaging in short-term politicking that has seen many of them messing up their lives.” Youth representatives present raised the issues of unemployment, empowerment and bursary for higher learning. Korane promised to address the issues. “Empowering the youth to realise self-employment is part of my government's agenda and the issues you have raised are valid," he said. Some young people requested to be enrolled in driving schools and to be given motorcycles to get into the boda boda business. Korane promised to prioritise the requests. He said the National Treasury is facing a financial crisis that has affected all counties over the past eight months, delaying government projects. Korane was accompanied by county assembly majority leader Mohamed Gabow, who is also the area MCA. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
