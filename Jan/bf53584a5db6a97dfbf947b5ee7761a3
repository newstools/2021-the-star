Former nominated member of parliament Sonia Birdi has expressed concern over the high rate of rape cases among the teenagers in the country by their relatives. Speaking to journalists in a Nairobi hotel, Sonia said it's quite unfortunate that many young girls are leaving schools due to pregnancy with no place to have a shelter. "Since Covid-19 broke out last year, a number of young girls have been impregnated by friends or relatives and are left with no place to go," said Sonia The vocal politician is now calling for the government and well-wishers to come up with structures where young girls who do not have a place to live can be accommodated even as they wait to be taken back to schools. She also lauded the government for taking actions against the perpetrators of this act including the man who was sentenced to 170 years for defiling her own two girls. "I think the government needs to do a lot in terms of law to protect girls by enact turf laws because I feel much more needs to be done." Sonia's sentiments come barely one week after a 45-year-old man was sentenced to 140 years in prison by a Baricho Court after he pleaded guilty to defiling his two daughters in Ndia, Kirinyaga County. John Gichira Gichini pleaded guilty to two counts of defiling and impregnating his step daughters.
