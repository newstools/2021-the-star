Police have launched a manhunt for a man who killed his brother after a quarrel in Muranga county. DCI boss George Kinoti said on Monday that Christopher Wakahiu, 26, is being trailed after committing the murder on Sunday evening at a construction site in Murang'a's Jerusalem area. The victim, a businessman in Nairobi is reported to have visited his parents at Gaturi village over the weekend, and on his way back passed by the said site to check the progress of a structure he was raising. "While at the site, he was joined by the suspect, whom he had employed as a caretaker," DCI said. The two are said to have engaged in a quarrel over an unestablished issue, when the caretaker -Christopher - drew a knife, stabbing his brother deeply into the left side of the chest thus killing him instantly. Kinoti asked Kenyans to help the police arrest the man who is currently in hiding. "Should anyone have information on the whereabouts of the suspect, please contact the DCI through our toll-free hotline number 0800 722 203. This service is available 24/7," he added.
