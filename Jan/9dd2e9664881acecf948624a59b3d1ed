Two principal secretaries have warned students that insecurity cases will be treated as criminal cases in the court of law. Gender and Social Development PS Collete Suda and her EAC counterpart Kevit Desai condemned the runaway indiscipline reported in several schools. They were reacting on Friday when they visited several earning institutions, both public and private in Migori county. Recently, two separate incidents of students attacking tutors were reported in Kisii and Nyamira counties. They expressed concerns of a section of students attacking and brutalizing their teachers. “These runaway cases are linked to moral decadence occasioned by the prolonged closure of schools in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic,” she said. On Tuesday, a form three student at Kisii High school stabbed and injured two teachers who had preferred disciplinary action against him. The two were flunked by Migori Commissioner Boaz Cherutich and a host of government officials at Kadika Girls Secondary. “We need to strengthen the guidance and counselling department in schools to avert the rising cases of truancy,” Suda said. She said the rate at which students are attacking teachers in schools is alarming and should not be entertained as such cases will be treated as criminal cases. Desai said such matters before a court of law should be addressed by police and judiciary. He affirmed the government’s support in addressing the social distancing challenge while urging the education stakeholders to promote open-air learning. “The issue of congestion still remains a challenge even to the government. In cases of conducive weather, I would encourage schools to embrace open-air learning as earlier proposed to address infrastructural inadequacies,” he said.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
