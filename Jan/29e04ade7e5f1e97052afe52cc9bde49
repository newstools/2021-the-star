Isuzu and NCBA Bank have unveiled new post-Covid recovery deal tailored for schools' transport. The two firms unveiled the vehicle purchase and leasing program that will give schools access to buses at favourable and flexible terms in a plan crafted to support post-Covid-19 economic recovery efforts. They consulted 822 schools on a suitable solution to the challenges they were facing. The program offers schools a one-term repayment holiday and a repayment period of up to six years, freeing up capital for other operations. The deal also includes an option for long term leasing of buses for between two to five years significantly allowing schools to get brand new Isuzu buses maintained by Isuzu without any upfront cash outlay. Speaking at the signing and unveiling ceremony, National Chair of the KPSA, Mutheu Kasanga, said  the asset finance program was a welcome development. "School buses are the safest way to move school children. This program provides a versatile payment solution that will enable schools acquire new buses to meet their transport needs,” she said. With definite monthly or termly lease rentals, schools can accurately allocate funds to other pressing demands with the assurance of a well-maintained fleet for transporting learners to and from school. Isuzu Marketing Director Wanjohi Kangangi said that schools remain a big part of the company’s customer base. “Over the years we have been the preferred supplier of top-quality school buses in the country and have gained the trust and confidence of thousands of learning institutions which have grown with us,” he said. “The reason we have partnered with NCBA Bank is to enable schools continue executing their core mandate, the provision of quality education, without worrying about how to allocate their funds." The director also said that that the company would give a free 10,000 litre water tank for every bus purchased to support schools instill good hygiene .
