Buuri MP Mugambi Rindikiri has said the ministries of Education and Health should not close schools that do not observe social distancing. He said the measures imposed by the Ministry of Health cannot be applicable in some schools unless they are supported by the national government. “Some schools in the grassroots are in a pathetic state and officials should ask how much money the government has allocated to such schools before they close them, as doing so will have consequences,” he said. “They should stop joking around and I dare them to come and close schools in my constituency. I will face them head on and ask them what they are doing to help the situation,” he said. Rindikiri spoke at Mburugiti Primary School in Buuri constituency on Monday when he opened a new classroom built by the Constituency Development Fund. He said he will build five more in the school. The MP said the government has resorted to intimidation because it does not have money to build more classrooms. “If they would have set aside funds as Rwanda did they would have been building more classrooms in schools where there are problems instead of closing them,” he said. The legislator said that the national government has misplaced priorities and the funds meant for BBI should address the issues facing public schools in the country. He said the nurses’ strike should also be addressed urgently as poor Kenyans are suffering due to lack of health services. The MP, who is a staunch supporter of Deputy President William Ruto, said he will remain steadfast in his support for the DP. He said some of the signatures collected in the BBI initiatives are fake. “In my constituency, a chief duped residents to write their names saying those who sign will be given land yet it was the collection of BBI signatures,” Rindikiri said.
