Uganda's opposition politician Bobi Wine, a pop star whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has said the US ambassador was "turned away" from his home by soldiers during an attempted visit. Ambassador Natalie Brown has not responded to the claim. Bobi Wine said his home remains cordoned by the military and he was not being allowed to leave. He previously said his life was being threatened following Thursday's election which saw Yoweri Museveni win a sixth elected term amid reports of election irregularities. President Museveni has denied rigging the elections but the EU, the United Nations and several rights groups have raised concerns. The US has also called for investigations into reports of irregularities in the election. Last week, Brown the United States will not observe the Uganda elections. Through a statement last Wednesday, the US Ambassador to Uganda said the cancellation had been informed by the decision by the Electoral Commission of Uganda to deny more than 75 per cent of the US election observer accreditations requested. She said that despite multiple requests, the Electoral Commission provided no explanation for its decision, “which it communicated mere days before the elections”. Brown noted that they had complied with all Electoral Commission accreditation requirements, as they had in previous elections in Uganda. She further said that they are concerned about reports that the Electoral Commission had denied accreditation requests from members of other diplomatic missions and large numbers of Ugandan observers.
