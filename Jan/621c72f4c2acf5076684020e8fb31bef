The 2019/2020 National Super League (NSL) top scorer Eric Ombija  is still hunting for his first goal in the Kenya Premier League. The former Gor Mahia striker scored 17 goals while plying his trade at Coast Stima. He signed for KPL returnees City Stars in the last transfer window. He has started three consecutive games for Simba wa Nairobi clocking 90 minutes against Posta Rangers and Ulinzi. In the last game against Sofapaka at Wundanyi Stadium, he played for 77 minutes before he was substituted in a game City Stars lost 1-0. Ombija is optimistic his moment of glory will come. “So far, so good and the only thing left is to start scoring the goals,” he told the club's website. The youthful striker added: “We are doing everything right and as players, we have vowed to step up a gear and turn results around. “We want the entire City Stars to start smiling once again as they did in the NSL with regular wins.” Ombija started the season opener against Nzoia in Narok, where he clocked 61 minutes. He missed out on the next two games against KCB and Bandari then returned with a cameo appearance against Bidco United. Sub appearances against Vihiga United and Wazito prepared him for the full games against Posta Rangers, where he came out with an important assist to earn a man of the match accolade, then against Ulinzi Stars. Last week, Ugandan hitman Jimmy Bageya left the club on mutual agreement, ending his 7th stint at the club. “Jimmy intimated he had personal issues to attend to that were a hindrance to his optimal performance at the club hence the mutual agreement that we part ways,” said club CEO Patrick Korir
