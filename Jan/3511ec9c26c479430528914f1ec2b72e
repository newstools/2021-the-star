Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana has declared interest in the Council of Governors chairmanship. Godhana wants to take the mantle from Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya whose term is coming to an end. The COG elections will be held on January 29, 2021. "A new broom sweeps clean... I am coming at a time when we are heading to elections... I am capable of taking the mantle and synergising the council to live its purpose," he told the Star on Friday. Drumming support for his candidature, Godhana said he is the best person to defend devolution. "I will lobby for partnerships. I have experience and the exposure needed. I am here to present new and good ideas as we protect devolution," he said. Godhana said the chairmanship role was rotational and it would only be fair if it was taken to Coast. "This seat has not been given to Coastarians. it's only fair that other regions are given an opportunity. This time there is someone who has volunteered. So people from the Coast need this chance," he said. "I am very eligible, in terms of qualification, I over qualify." Oparanya was elected by his colleagues in February 2020 for a second and final term in office through consensus after President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila backed his bid. There are reports that Uhuru will throw his weight behind a governor who supports the BBI process to succeed Oparanya. The head of state has enjoyed a good working relationship with Oparanya during the latter's tenure. Their camaraderie blossomed further with their BBI agitation. CoG chairmanship is a powerful post that serves as a link between the county governments and the national executive and has a lot of leverage, including unfettered access to the President. The chairperson serves as the voice of the county governments and has a lot of privileges, including a stand-by chopper funded by taxpayers through the council's secretariat.
