ODM leader Raila Odinga went to enjoy some ugali and vegetables in Burma market on Wednesday when pockets of DP William Ruto supporters  taunt him with a wheelbarrow. Raila, in the company of Maina Kamanda and Junet Mohammed, also  bought some meat and then addressed a crowd outside when a handful of Ruto supporters who were far from where the ODM leader was, tried to shout Ruto’s name. Raila went on to address the crowd and spoke about the need to pass the BBI documents which he said was a result of the  handshake. “The handshake gave birth to BBI which has solutions to many problems that we face today,” he said. On Twitter, Raila said he made a stop at the market 'to say hello to the people'. Earlier, Raila met youths to drum up support for BBI. Taking to Twitter, he said, "I had a dynamic and insightful engagement with youth hailing from Nairobi county who pledged their full and unwavering support for the BBI process. The referendum train continues to garner speed unabated. It's now all systems go!" Raila has kicked off aggressive countrywide public engagements in what appears to be a tactical move to counter Ruto’s wave ahead of 2022 election. Raila’s tours that started a month ago came almost one month after DP Ruto scaled down his public engagements due to what he termed a surge in Covid-19 infections. For instance, in a span of four weeks, the former Prime Minister visited seven counties, holding strategic meetings with local leadership as he drums up support for the Building Bridges Initiative. The engagements are also laced with 2022 politics.
