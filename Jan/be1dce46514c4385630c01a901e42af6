 The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) collected Sh200 billion in the Coast region in the six month period between July and December 2020, according to the  KRA Southern Region Coordinator Joseph Tonui. Tonu said despite the effects of  Covid-19 on the economy,  the collection surpassed  a target of 183 billion He said with soon after Covid-19 was reported in Kenya,  KRA realigned its operations to ensure continuity by undertaking all its clearance procedure online. “Customs and border control department in the region collected Sh200.955 billion, surpassing a target of Sh183.587 billion in the half financial year," said Tonui. Speaking at an event to mark the International Customs Day in Mombasa, celebrated on January 26 anually, Tonui said they could not have raised the  amount without implementing stringent border control measures. He said the use of technology and proactive nature of the customs officials  ensured contraband trade is contained at the port of Mombasa. “The port of Mombasa has become less attractive for smuggling and international crimes. KRA and other relevant local and international security agents have succeeded in preventing the port of Mombasa from being used as a conduit for contraband trade,” he said. KRA has also piloted a new Integrated Customs Management Systems (ICMS) which will replaced the old Simba System in cargo clearance at the port of Mombasa. However, last week, the system experienced a breakdown leading to congestion at the port of Mombasa. They were over 10 ships waiting in the deep seas after the KRA ICMS system went down. However, Tonui said any new system is prone to encounter challenges, but his team is working round the clock to ensure the congestion at KPA is cleared. “Despite the challenges, the ICMS system is a game changer in facilitating faster cargo clearance. Our team is working to ensure its efficiency,” he said.
