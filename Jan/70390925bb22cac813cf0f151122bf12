President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga names are conspicuously missing from the IEBC BBI verified signatures. The IEBC had published the names of the verified BBI signatures for public scrutiny on Thursday. The commission published the signatures with names of people who signed, their counties, constituency and polling stations. But the names of the two leaders who officially launched the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) signature drive in November 2020 were nowhere to be seen. After going through the two documents, the two endorsed the BBI Constitutional (Amendment) Bill 2020 by appending their signatures. IEBC Director of Voter Education and Communication Joyce Ekuam told the Star that the process has not been completed. "The process is not yet complete...it is just interim. We are still finalising it at the Bomas of Kenya," she said. In the documents, there were also many duplicates with one name appearing thrice with the same ID numbers. Kenyans can check their details through two files located on the links below: https://www.iebc.or.ke/Building_Bridges_Initiative_File_1.pdf https://www.iebc.or.ke/Building_Bridges_Initiative_File_2.pdf 400 clerks had been hired to burn the midnight oil to ensure the task is completed in a fortnight. The clerks were sworn in and took the oath of secrecy on December 30 last year before their orientation and training. They were paid Sh1,200 per day; altogether they will be paid Sh480,000 per day.
