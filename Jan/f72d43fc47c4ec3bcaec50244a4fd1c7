Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo has said he will choose his own deputy and will not tolerate undue influence from the ODM party. The assembly last week rejected his nominee for deputy governor James Gesami for failure to get clearance from ODM, CRB and presenting an expired certificate of good conduct. “There is no way ODM can be giving us instructions on how to run the government. ODM has no right to dictate me on who should be my deputy governor since I am firmly in charge of the county and I know what I am doing,” Nyaribo said. Gesami's nomination had split the county down the middle, with some MPs and MCAs supporting the choice as others opposing it. Speaker Moffat Teya, who led the vetting team, was accused of conflict of interest in the matter, with some MCAs saying he wanted the post for himself. Speaking to journalists in his office on Wednesday, Nyaribo disowned a letter circulating on social media allegedly from the ODM party and nominating Charles Makori Rigoro for the position. He said the purported letter was a fake. The county boss ascended to the office on December 29 last year following the death of his predecessor and boss John Nyagarama. But he is under siege following recent developments that have threatened to tear apart his plans of proving his worth ahead of the next general elections. He fired all but three of Nyagarama's Executive committee members as he sought to consolidate power and run with a fresh team and set his agenda. But the impasse surrounding his deputy selection process has put a check on his momentum.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
