Former Sailor's gang member Lexxy Yung has apologised to Mwalimu Rachel, who was their former manager. Lexxy Young left the group to join the gospel industry, saying he just needs to give God thanks. "...I just felt it is right to put God first in my life for all he has done for me. I mean, he is there for me even when I sin he still wakes me up. Holy or not, he has you." Adding, "I want to take this opportunity to apologise to the lady who got us here as a group and also personally. Big up to Mwalimu Rachel. The beef was so intense. But people fight, even family fight. But I hope you can forgive me and my brothers for the mistakes we made." The team had a bitter fallout last year after the team changed their management.
