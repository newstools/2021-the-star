Former Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni has disputed claims that he did not vote for ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi during the 2013 General Election. Kioni was Musalia Mudavadi's running mate in the 2013 General Election on Amani Coalition. Speaking during the funeral of Mama Hannah Mudavadi in Mululu, Vihiga County, Kioni defended himself over what he termed as lies and misreporting that he cast the ballot instead for President Uhuru Kenyatta. Kioni had a tough time explaining himself to the hostile crowd forcing Mudavadi to join him at the podium. "The long and short of the story is that it was a lie. We have been to court just for the record and the court has even awarded me damages for defamation against the media houses," Kioni said. "I voted for Musalia Mudavadi. I did not vote for my good friend Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta." Mudavadi also defended Kioni as he quelled the crowd urging them to respect the occasion and the Head Of State who was present. "We are here for mama Hannahâ€™s funeral, not for political competition. The person who should be ashamed is the one who said Kioni did not vote for me and he was not at the polling station. Shame on you!" Mudavadi said. "Kioni lost his seat over that and we should not make this look like a political competition. Jeremiah stood for courage. Let us show respect and let us show a new beginning for Kenya."
