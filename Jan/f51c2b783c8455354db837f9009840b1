Safety and security do not just happen, they are the result of collective consensus and public investment. We owe our children, the most vulnerable citizens in our society, a life free of violence and fear. Kenya shares a border with volatile Somalia and has suffered bloody attacks from terror groups. There is no denying that we need to be extra vigilant. Just last week Mandera Governor Ali Roba raised concerns about security in his county, saying al Shabaab militants control key roads. He expressed disappointment at the national government's handling of security matters. The national government, in its response, said Mandera is no longer stomping ground for al Shabaab. If the country is to be secured, it is high time those in government stopped the talk and swung into action. Cooperation between the county and national governments is desperately needed to tackle insecurity. If county chiefs are involved in security decisions, they will be part of the solution and will actively provide intelligence to thwart attacks. Kenyans too have a huge role to play. It is only responsible and patriotic for every individual to take upon themselves to report suspicious activities or unregistered foreigners for the good of all.
