Youth and Gender CAS Rachael Shebesh has urged the church not to allow on the pulpit abusive politicians who lack respect for the house of God. Speaking at Ejinja Corner in Kakamega during the funeral of Florence Sakwa, the mother of National Youth Service director general Matilda Sakwa, Shebesh reiterated that it has become very apparent that politicians were mudsling each other in funerals and churches. “I would like you to help us as church. Not only should we stop this in funerals because we don’t take cognizance of the feeling of the family that has lost a loved one, but also in the churches. Please pastors, don’t give the pulpit to be used by politicians who abuse one another or seek political mileage,” Shebesh said. She said politicians have the capacity to call rallies elsewhere and address people and sell their policies from there. “But we must desist from doing that in places like this where we are mourning and where God is being worshiped,” she said. She reiterated that the Building Bridges Initiative will bring peace and unity in the country. Shebesh called on the public to be patient as plans to popularise the document are underway. “If we go according to the programme that we have set out, you will realise we have not started campaigning and when we start campaigning we will do it in the forums that are right. Neither will we be abusive nor force Kenyans to accept. We will explain what is in that document,” she said. Shebesh said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga have put the unity and peace of the country as a priority and cannot give Kenyans something that is not good for the country.
