Kibra MP Imran Okoth's mother Angeline Ajwang' is dead. She died on Saturday morning. Taking to Twitter, he said, "In life, we loved you dearly, in death we still love you. In our hearts you hold a place, I cried endlessly when you died but I promise, I won't let the tears mar the smiles that you've given me when you were alive. I know you are listening from above. Fare thee well mum." Imran took over from his brother, Ken Okoth who died of cancer in 2019. Ken, who was 41, was serving his second term. Ajwang' had opposed the cremation of Ken, although it finally took place. She had wanted her son buried in Homa Bay.
