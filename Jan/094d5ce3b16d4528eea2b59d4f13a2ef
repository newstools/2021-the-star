The Kenya Amateur Golf Championship, formerly known as Goty, has two new events, according to the 2021 Kenya Golf Union calendar. As it has been the tradition, the series will tee off with the Sigona Bowl on January 23-24 and end on December 11-12 with the Nyali Open. Two new additions to the KAGC, which is the elite amateur series in Kenya, are Goldfields Trophy slated for May 1-2 in Kakamega and Ronald Marshall & Toby Gibson Trophy at Njoro Country Club on September 4-5. This year’s KAGC heads to Muthaiga Club on  May 13-16 before touring Nakuru on October 21-24. The Match-play and Stroke-play events will, as usual be used to determine two slots for the Kenya Open. The winners of both events will earn automatic tickets to the 2022 Kenya Open Championship. Royal Nairobi Club’s Jay Sandhu racked up the Kenyatta Memorial trophy after winning the Kenya Amateur Stroke Play Championship at Royal on October 24. In winning the Strokeplay event, Sandhu became the second amateur golfer in the country to qualify for this year’s Kenya Open set for March Karen Country Club course. In September, Isaac Makokha also earned a place in the event after winning the title on home course at Vet Lab Sports Club. This year’s series will be without champion Samuel Njoroge who has joined the paid ranks.
