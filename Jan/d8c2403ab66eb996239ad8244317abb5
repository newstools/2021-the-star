Former Laikipia East MP Antony Kimaru was on Thursday charged with stealing a title deed for land worth Sh18.5 million. Kimaru was accused of stealing the title deed of parcel LR. 10422/13 Nanyuki township belonging to George Odinga and David Silverstein, the executors of the late Livia Lepoer Trench. The former lawmaker allegedly committed the offence on August 5, 2016, at the Ministry of Lands headquarters in Nairobi. He also faces another count of fraudulently making an agreement of sale of parcel LR. 10422/13 Nanyuki township dated August 3, 2009, purporting to be genuine and issued by Mwangi Kariuki advocate. The court heard that Kimaru also unlawfully uttered an agreement of sale of land to Silas Kimeli, the deputy registrar ELC High Court Nyeri, on February 5, 2020. He is further accused of procuring the registration of the land by falsely pretending that it had been lawfully transferred to him by the executors. Kimaru denied the charges before Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku. Through lawyer Gregory Ndege, he pleaded with the court for lenient bond terms and copies of witness statements. The prosecution has listed 16 witnesses to testify in the case. He was released on Sh300,000 bail or Sh1 million bond. The case will be mentioned on January 28.
