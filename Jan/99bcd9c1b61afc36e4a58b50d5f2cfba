The police officer who fatally shot his friend in Nyari estate as they were chewing miraa has been formally charged with murder before the Milimani High Court. Through a virtual session, Police Officer Edgar Mokamba on Tuesday appeared before Justice Daniel Ogembo and denied the offence of murder. The prosecution had earlier informed the court that Mokamba had undergone mental assessment and was found fit to stand trial. It is alleged that on December 29 last year at Nyari Estate he shot and killed Zachary Makuto. The state did not object to his release on bail but asked the court to order for a pre-bail report so that they know where he will be staying during the pendency of the trial. Lawyer Danstan Omari told the court that due to the good gesture by the prosecution not to object bail, Mokamba was willing to take a plea bargain. Omari said his client had accidentally shot the deceased and they will opt for plea bargaining at the right time. The case will be mentioned on Friday this week to confirm if the pre-bail report will be ready before he is granted bail by the court. Mokamba who was arrested on December 30 is alleged to have fired 10 bullets in unclear circumstances on that night. Omari said his client is apologizing to the citizens for mishandling his gun saying the deceased was his personal friend for many years and he had no intention of killing him.
