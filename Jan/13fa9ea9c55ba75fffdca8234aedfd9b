Anti-riot police in Nyacheki, Kisii on Sunday dispersed demonstrators from Bobasi who want the constituency to divided into two. County Deputy Speaker David Onuso, who is also the Masige East Ward MCA was arrested by police who had erected a barrier along the road between Nyacheki and Nyangusu. Onuso had gone to plead with them to allow the demonstrations to go on when he was arrested. A few MCAs who were with him -Blansius Mature (Bassi Boitang'are Ward) and Geoffrey Ombati (Sameta Mokwerero) fled from the scene after the demonstration turned violent. Teargas canisters were lobbed into the air to disperse hundreds of protesters that had already gathered. Journalists covering the demo were also roughed up. The officers said they did not want them to cover an illegal protest. "We don't want to know if you're journalists or not, and whether you're one you cannot come here to cover something already declared illegal," said an officer in riot gear before he lobbed rear gas onto bodabodas and those carrying placards. Last week, Interior CS Fred Matiangi told the residents that the division of the constituency was already among the agenda being looked at the highest decision making organs. He spoke at Majimazuri Primary School.
