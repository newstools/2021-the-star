The capacity of inter-county trains will be doubled - two from Nairobi and two from Mombasa - as schools reopen on Monday, Transport CS James MachariaÂ  has said. There will also be no express trains on Monday. They will make stops at all the seven stations. The CS spoke on Sunday at KICC. Macharia said the ministry held talks with the matatu sector and it was agreed that all drivers will be tested for alcohol, they will not be allowed to drive long distances and they will not hike fares. Meanwhile, social distancing challenges should not be an excuse to resist reopening of schools, Education CS George Magoha has said. "The government has done everything possible to ensure schools are ready for reopening," he said. Magoha said every open space will be used by learners to ensure social distancing. The CS warned parents against failing to pay fees on the pretext that the government has warned administrators against sending children back home. He said the children have been eating while at home and should not expect schools to cater to costs without their paying for services.
