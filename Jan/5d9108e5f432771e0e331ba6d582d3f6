The Kenya Simbas will face Zambia and Senegal in the Africa Gold Cup fixtures slated for July 1-18 Simbas will host both teams for the matches with top two teams advancing to the 2022 Rugby Africa Cup edition which will feature eight teams. The 2022 edition will serve as the qualification round for the 2023 Rugby World Cup slated for France. Pool matches will be played on round-robin basis with each pool having a single venue for all their matches. Other venues to be used for the preliminaries will be Windhoek, Namibia and Kampala, Uganda and Tunis, Tunisia. Simbas last played Zambia in 2019, winning 31-16 and Senegal in 2017, winning 45-25. A statement signed sent by Rugby Africa read: “The Africa Cup preliminaries kick off in July with four pools of three teams each playing round-robin tournament at a single venue per pool. "The best two teams from each pool will qualify for Africa Cup 2022, which serves as the final round of Rugby World Cup 2023 qualifier for Africa,” the statement continued. The Repechage is set for May and it will have the likes of Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Eswatini and Mauritius taking part. “The attention in May turns to West Africa for the Africa Cup repechage, a qualifier for the 12th slot in the 2021 show. Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Eswatini, Mauritius, Morocco (pending suspension review), Nigeria and Rwanda are all eligible for the big draw, with a July international window as a fallback option.” Simbas head coach Paul Odera hopes Simbas will start training camp next month to gauge players' fitness after being out for the last nine months due to Covid-19 pandemic. Simbas have lined up a proposed tour to Stellensbosch, South Africa, where they play two matches in April as part of preparations for the Africa Gold Cup.
