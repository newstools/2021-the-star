Our history and the present dynamics show that no political third-force in Kenya can make any meaningful impact in an election. Perhaps the kind of third force its proponents are talking about is something I do not understand. Perhaps they need to explain what they mean. Are they implying that they are getting into this race to become number three? Or are they getting into this race with a view to joining number one after the election? What exactly do they mean by third force? Every serious political party, the world over, has only one primary objective – to capture state power and run government on the basis of its manifesto. Granted, there could be secondary objectives, but power is the ultimate goal. A party can capture power singly or in partnership with others. So saying that you are in third force is not enough. You must demonstrate that you are working towards forming a government and must be clear what formula you want to use to form it. As Orange Democratic Movement, a serious national party with functioning party organs – in fact the only national party with serious organs – we are focused currently on instituting necessary political, administrative, legal and constitutional reforms under the Building Bridges Initiative framework. The 2022 succession has never crossed our minds. We want to be done with this reform agenda first before we can start talking about a formation for 2022. It is important that every serious Kenyan does that. At the end of the day, what I know is that progressive forces are going to coalesce around ODM and its partners in the handshake. The reactionary forces will coalesce around the [Deputy President William Ruto’s] Tangatatanga formation. This could be the first election that would be defined on ideological terms. In short, the third force proponents must choose on which side they would want to fall even as they talk about their formation. The ODM Political Affairs secretary and Ugunja MP spoke to the Star
