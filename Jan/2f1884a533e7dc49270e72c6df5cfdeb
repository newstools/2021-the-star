Blazers striker Eleanor Chebet is keen on playing for the national under 21 side even though she is currently training with the senior women’s side ahead of the African Cup of Nations in March. The 2019 Magharibi Michezo awards winner 19-year old turns 20 in July was the runner up top scorer in 2019 with seven goals. “Playing with your age mates enables you to express yourself in a better way and be comfortable at the same time. It is an honour to train with the experienced players and I am ready to grab my opportunity but ultimately, to be honest, it would be ideal if I play for the junior side,” said the budding striker. The Junior Africa Cup for the U21s is scheduled for March 22-28 in Accra, Ghana. The Misikhu Girls High school alumnus won national titles with the western-based institution in 2016 and 2017. She also lifted the East Africa trophy in 2017. Chebet, who failed to make the final squad for the Olympic qualifiers in 2019 said she habours no hard feelings for that decision but promised to work her way up and make the final squad in future. “It was tough to accept the chop in the last minute but I have moved on. I just need to train hard as I wait for my time. Priority now is to gain match fitness since we’ve not been training for a while,” she said. With only two months before Kenya hosts the North East Africa qualifiers, Chebet said players must take the home ground advantage to book the sole regional slot to the continental championships.
