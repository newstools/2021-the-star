It was a sigh of relief for over 5,000 shareholders of Murutani Company in Kiambu county after their grabbed properties were reverted to them by a court. The shareholders, who are teachers, started the company in 1983 and bought two plots within Kiambu town where they built commercial premises. “Since 1990, different boards of directors have run the affairs of the company from time to time,” chairman Anthony Kamuna said. In 2008 the shareholders resolved that the assets be sold and the company dissolved. But this did not happen. New elections were held in 2010 and Kamuna became the chairman. The board embarked on selling the properties through a firm that turned out to be corrupt, he said. Njuakim commercial agencies had drawn two sale agreements of Block 1/57 in 2009 of Sh7.5 million and property transferred to the agency and was issued with a forged Murutani receipt of Sh3.2 million without depositing any money in Murutani accounts. The second sale agreement attracted a price of Sh4.6 million. The Kenya National Union of Teachers noted the unfolding events and conducted a valuation of the property and found it to be worth Sh10 million in 2009. The then company secretary and Njuakim agent were arrested and  found guilty of fraud and forgery. In block 11/87 the company property a valuation was done in 2009 and was valued at Sh65 million but again Njuakim agencies was to sell the property at a throw away price of Sh40 million. The current company secretary Charles Munyua said the company is progressing in regaining the shareholders' properties.
