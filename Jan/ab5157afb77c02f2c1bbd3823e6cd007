At least three persons have been murdered and their bodies dumped along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road in the last one month. The body of a man was found dumped near Mt Longonot National Park, with indications that he was strangled. The body had a rope around the neck and was found by residents who first thought it was a suicide before police suggested otherwise. Late last month, a body with head injuries was found near the area dumpsite and a week later another was discovered near Mirera area with indications the victim had been strangled. According to Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru, a report of suicide was made to the police but on inquiry it emerged that this had been staged-managed. Waweru noted that the deceased was killed elsewhere and the body ferried to the scene where members of the public spotted it. “We have collected the fingerprints and sent them to the Registrar of Persons for identification while the body is lying at the local morgue,” he said on Thursday. The police boss added that they were investigating the rising cases of bodies being dumped along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road by unknown people. “The area between Naivasha and Mai Mahiu is sparsely populated, making it easier for those involved in this crime to dump the bodies without anyone seeing them,” he said. Residents of Jikaze IDP camp along the road expressed their concern over an increase in the number of bodies dumped in the area in the last two years. They noted that the majority of the victims were middle-aged men who were killed through strangulation using ropes. One of the IDPs, James Mburu, noted that the bodies were always dumped late in the night or very early in the morning. “We are now worried when we see unmarked cars driving off the highway as they have contributed to the number of dumped bodies,” he said. Early last year, two bodies of drivers who had been hired in Mlolongo and Kikuyu to ferry goods in two different incidents were found dumped in the area and their vehicles missing.
