A county workers union has moved to court to block the development of the Sh5 billion G47 Ugatuzi tower launched last December by the Council of Governors. Kenya County Government Workers Union says the project was undertaken without public participation, hence amounts to a violation of rights of its members. In their suit papers filed in Milimani court under a certificate of urgency, the union says public interest favours conserving the pension of workers from wastage and investment that violates the Constitution. “It will be against public interest if retirees cannot access their pension due to the illegal investment in Ugatuzi Tower,” it said. The court heard that the best time to address the legality of the project is at the commencement stage. “Unless the matter is certified urgent and dealt with expeditiously, the first respondent will commit the over Sh5 billion, which is way over the authorised annual spending, hence putting workers’ fund in imminent danger of misuse.” According to the union, county governments have huge bills of outstanding amounts unremitted to two pension schemes. “The county staffs have always been at risk of retiring without any savings.” The union now wants the court to issue orders stopping Laptrust and County Pension Fund from using resources and carrying out the construction of the tower. It has sued the Board of Trustees Local Authority Pension Trust, the County Pension Fund, County Pension Fund Financial Services Limited, Retirement Benefits Authority and the CoG. Laptrust was established under local government rules, 2007, as an umbrella retirement benefits scheme for all local authorities. Its principal objective is to provide pension and other retirement benefits to employees of the sponsors upon their retirement from service.
