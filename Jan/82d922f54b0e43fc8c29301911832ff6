Second half goals by Kevin Kimani and Whyvonne Isuza were all Wazito needed to floor Nzoia Sugar 2-1 in a Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Premier League match played at the Kasarani Annex. Nzoia had taken a first half lead through Eric Otieno's header but Wazito responded in the final half through Kimani who leveled matters from the spot after Dennis Shikayi was brought down in the box. The match appeared headed for a one-all draw but Wazito will have Isuza to thank as his late goal handed them their fourth straight win. The win saw Wazito stretch their tally to 17, one shy of league leaders KCB.Despite guiding the club to their fifth win of the season, coach Francis Kimanzi expressed discontent with his charges for letting in an early goal for the second successive game. "Much as I am happy with the win, I feel when we concede early, we end up using too much strength to searching for an equaliser and the winner. When we let in an early goal we are forced to change tact, something I want to change going forward. We are still not yet there because there are many matches remaining," said the former Harambee Stars coach His Nzoia counterpart Ibrahim Shikanda was bitter with their missed chances especially in the first half. " We had the opportunity to kill the game in the first half but we were poor in the final minutes. I am two weeks old at the club but I am happy with the way the boys are adapting to my philosophy. I am looking forward to changing a number of things and hopefully, they will bear fruit, " said the former Bandari assistant coach At the main stadium, Mathare United battled Bandari to a barren draw
