Banks in Kenya will stop accepting Barclays cheques effective February 1. This is almost one year since the name change to Absa, on February 10, last year. Absa Kenya has since asked customers with Barclays cheques to replace them in what will be one of the last transition moves to the new brand. "Please note that Barclays cheques will no longer be accepted by other banks effective 01.02.2021. Kindly plan replace your Barclays cheque book with an Absa cheque book to avoid any inconvenience," the lender has told its customers. Formerly known as Barclays Bank of Kenya, last year's name change marked a new era for the bank that has operated in Kenya for close to 104 years. Having received regulatory approvals, Barclays Life Assurance Kenya Limited also changed to Absa Life Assurance Kenya Limited effective February 10, 2020. Customers' account details however remained the same with branches continuing to operate as usual. The lender however started a shift on cards to the Absa brand with Barclays’ cards remaining in use until their date of expiry. Over the years, the bank has invested in crucial sectors of development of the national economy, including SMEs, agriculture, trade, agriculture and infrastructure. "We will continue to play a critical role by investing in these sectors while offering holistic financial services to individuals, small businesses and large organisations alike,”Absa Bank Kenya managing director Jeremy Awori said,during the transition.
