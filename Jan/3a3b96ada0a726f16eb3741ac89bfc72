The positivity rate for Covid-19 cases rose to 6.17 per cent Thursday after nearly a week below five per cent. The rate was 4.6 per cent on Wednesday, four per cent on Tuesday, and 3.19 per cent on Monday. The Ministry of Health had warned of a possible surge in numbers in January following expected gatherings over the festive period. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe urged county governments to keep high levels of preparedness to avert a new wave. “… we must anticipate any situation and therefore that is why we have asked that the preparations for all sorts of isolation facilities in counties are all put in place just in the event of anything like that happening,” Kagwe said. On Thursday, 335 of 5,424 samples tested turned positive results in 24 hours, up from 271 on Wednesday, 219 on Tuesday and just 106 on Monday. The virus caseload is 97,733 from 1,075,673 tests. Eight more people died, pushing the toll to 1,702. In a statement, Kagwe reported that 340 patients had recovered from the disease – 261 at home and 79 in hospital.  Some 80,306 people have recovered from the virus since March. “Currently, there are 536 patients admitted in various health facilities countrywide and 2,498 on home based isolation and care. 29 patients are in the intensive care unit, 18 of whom are on ventilator support and nine on supplemental oxygen while two are on observation,” Kagwe said. The CS said that 10 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen in the general wards. Nairobi recorded 102 new cases followed by Meru with 46, Makueni with 40, Nyeri with 19, kajiado with 14, Embu with 13, Mombasa with 12 and Kiambu with 11.
