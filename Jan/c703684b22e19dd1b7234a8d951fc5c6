Former Garissa Governor Nathif Jama has been endorsed by his Aulihan clan to recapture the county's top seat in next year's polls. Jama lost the seat to Governor Ali Korane in 2017. The former governor was endorsed during a meeting Saturday, which was attended by elders from the nine sub-clans of Aulihan clan, traditional leaders, youth and women. In Northeastern, clans play an integral role in endorsing aspirants, who in most cases end up winning. Sultan Hamud Sheikh from Aulihan community said the endorsement was the culmination of a series of meetings between the elders and residents. “As a community, we have unanimously agreed to have Nathif Jama as our sole candidate for the governor seat. Going forward, we will rally our communities to back him. We will also ask him to reach out to other communities residing in the county for support,” Sheikh said. Bishar Gure, who read the declaration, said the endorsement of Jama was done ‘in the best interest of the larger Aulihan community and the people of Garissa county." “In making this declaration, the meeting made a solemn request to all other Aulihan persons who have shown interest in the seat to support Jama,” Gure said. Jama welcomed the trust the elders had bestowed on him, saying "the journey to recapture the seat has just started". “I want to sincerely thank the elders and my larger community for giving me one more chance. Now I can go looking for votes from other communities knowing well that I have those from my community under lock and key,” Jama said. The move by the elders to endorse Jama will come as a setback to his fellow clansmen – Dadaab MP Mohamed Dahiye and High Commissioner to Botswana Mohamed Shidiye – who were said to be eyeing the seat. The elders' endorsement is likely to be a repeat of the 2013 and 2017 political contest between Korane (Abduwak clan) and Jama (Aulihan clan). The three major clans in Garissa are Aulihan, Abduwak and Abdalla.
