Kenya Premier League side, Ulinzi Stars' received a major blow as their key marksman Enosh Ochieng will be away for the next three months on official duties. The absence of the 2019 'Golden Boot' winner has thrown coach Benjamin Nyangweso's plans to prepare his troops for a recovery mission into disarray. "Enosh Ochieng will not be with the team for the foreseeable future. He will be out for official duty for the next three months," said the club on its official online portal. With the former Muhoroni Youth player deployed elsewhere, Nyangweso will heavily rely on the reigning Cecafa Senior Challenge top scorer Oscar Wamalwa and Masita Masuta to bear the burden of scoring goals. Wamalwa, however, is yet to regain his scoring instincts as well as his place in the starting team this season after recovering from a shoulder injury which saw him go under the knife last year. Elsewhere, Sofapaka head coach Ken Odhiambo is unfazed by the team's inability to keep clean sheets this season. The 2009 league champions have conceded in all the six matches they have played but Odhiambo, who took over the reigns at the start of the year says it is not a major concern provided they win. The Harambee Stars' assistant, who is yet to taste defeat from the time he took over from John Baraza ,anticipates the team to start recording unblemished wins after five rounds. The former Bandari coach said the players were on course to fully adapt to his philosophy of playing as a unit which he believes is the surest ingredient to ending their more than a decade wait for their second title. "It doesn't worry me so long as the team wins their matches. However I have started fixing the defence and I expect the loopholes to be sealed fully soon. The boys are slowly adapting to my style of play and within a short time, we will return to where we belong on the table and push to achieve our target," he said.
