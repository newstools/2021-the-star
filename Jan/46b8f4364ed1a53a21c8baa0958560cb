New Sofapaka head coach Ken Odhiambo says the club's ambition to win the league this season enticed him to join them from Bandari. Odhiambo was appointed last month to replace John Baraza, who was sent packing after a poor start in the current season. After axing Baraza, the club laid bare their intentions to send him for further studies, either in Norway or Germany. The Harambee Stars' assistant coach formally took over on Friday and will be assisted by Mike Mururi. The former Nairobi City Stars coach revealed that the decision to leave the coastal club for Sofapaka was inspired by the latter's dream to win their second league title this season. Batoto Ba Mungu won the league in 2009, the same year they debuted in the top flight. However, that was the last time they won the title as they but have failed to replicate the performance in the past decadeÂ  despite changing coaches and investing heavily in the playing unit. "I am delighted to join Sofapaka bacause their ambitions are so clear. When Sofapaka boss Elly Kalekwa talked to me, I felt it was a good opportunity to join and help achieve the set targets. His desires for the club to win the title were clear hence it was an easy decision to make," he told the club's website He added, "The club has a good set of players who are talented. I believe they are capable of achieving a lot."
