Three masters students at Mount Kenya University have won an international grant to distribute solar-powered lanterns to families in Kiandutu slums, Thika. The COV-AID Graduate Student Mini-Grants by the Talloires Network of Engaged Universities and the Open Society University Network will enable students Rose Macharia, Nelly Kayanda and Daniel Kiriti to distribute the lamps to kiosks, informal roadside stalls, community service points (such as bathrooms, toilets, and water points) and to security officers. The students studying Information Technology, Counselling Psychology and Governance and Ethics received Sh275, 000 for their project. Kiandutu slums, which is Thika subcounty’s largest informal settlement, has a population of about 30,000 people. The houses are mostly tin and polythene shacks and are poorly lit. “Our initial target is 200 homesteads. But we aim to scale it up in due course,” said Macharia. Through the grant, the MKU community will offer mentorship to the youth in the slums. “Our primary focus will be on political and social radicalisation, drugs and substance abuse, and career growth and opportunities,” Kayanda said. The call for applications for the COV-AID Graduate Student Mini-Grants attracted over 100 applications from universities worldwide. The three MKU students were among the six whose proposals were picked. Talloires Network described the process of choosing the winners as “extremely competitive.” The Talloires Network grants programme recognises outstanding commitment to civic engagement by university students during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The Network’s secretariat is based at Tufts University in Massachusetts, USA.
