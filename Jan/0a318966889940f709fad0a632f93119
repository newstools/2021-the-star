The Judicial Service Commission has begun the process of recruiting a new chief justice to succeed David Maraga, who retired a few weeks ago. Apart from Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, lawyer Philip Murgor has also expressed interest in the  job. The holder of the Chief Justice position  is an important person in the judicial system. Apart from leading the arm of the government, the CJ presides over the JSC and the Supreme Court. It is, therefore, important that the next Chief Justice be a person who is completely untainted by corruption or a scandal of any kind — whether real or perceived. His or her reputation must match, if not surpass, that of the proverbial Caesar’s wife. The country needs a person who can assure investors that they will get fair rulings should they end up in court and that contractual obligations will be honoured and enforced expeditiously within definite and publicised timeframes. Because the person will have to make huge judicial decisions, the next chief justice must have a solid track record of ground-breaking jurisprudence. A person of extraordinary intellectual ability should occupy the office of the chief justice. If the occupant of the position is a lesser figure, the person is likely to be overshadowed by other members of the court.
