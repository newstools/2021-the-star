School turnout is low in Turkana and schools will work with chiefs and others to bring learners back, including pregnant girls. “There is a slow return of learners in Turkana. We are working with all stakeholders to ensure each child get back to school, including victims of early pregnancies,” Education CAS Mumina Bunayo said on Tuesday. She was touring schools to assess their preparedness for reopening. The CAS said the national government will provide sanitiser for water-scarce schools so students can wash their hands and curb the spread of Covid-19. The reopening of schools has been faced with challenges of water shortage, lack of face masks and an acute shortage of classrooms to enable learners to adhere social distancing. “We understand not all schools have running water, but the ministry has tried our best to put washing points in schools where there is water shortage," Bunayo said. "And we will provide sanitiser where water is scarce; it will be under the control of teachers," she said. Bunayo also said government will provide face masks for children whose families cannot afford them. “The government has already procured food for schools in arid regions and Turkana has been prioritised to attract children back to school,” she said. Turkana Education director Peter Magiri deplored that due to classroom shortage pupils and students will learn outside under acacia trees. “We have done a lot of preparation but we are still faced with challenges of social distancing caused by lack of classrooms, shortage of water, face masks and lack of teachers,” Magiri said. He said he and teachers agreed the areas under acacias will be converted to classrooms. Teachers sit in the shade during their meetings. (Edited by V. Graham)
