The Kisumu Medical and Education Trust and PharmAccess have  signed a three-year licence agreement in a bid to improve the quality of healthcare services. In the agreement, KMET has been granted the rights to use SafeCare brand, standards, tools and methodology for the assessment and certification of healthcare institutions. The agreement enables KMET to act as a representative and an advocate of Safecare brand with strategic partners in public and private sector health space. SafeCare is a unique standards-based approach for measuring, improving and recognising the quality of healthcare services, against a set of internationally recognised standards. SafeCare also provides the tools, instruments and methodology that can be used to improve healthcare services. To date, almost 6,000 SafeCare quality assessments have been performed in sub-Saharan Africa, marking a significant development in the measurement of healthcare quality in the region. PharmAccess director East Africa and Quality director Nicole Spieker said for over 10 years PharmAccess and KMET have had a strong partnership dedicated to improving the quality of healthcare. "With this licence agreement, both organisations join forces take the next step in realising this shared vision.” KMET executive director Monica Oguttu said SafeCare is a game changer. "We have proven that quality sells itself as majority of health facilities in our network have qualified to join panels of major health insurance schemes and boast of consistently growing clientele,”She said. Faith Muigai, SafeCare regional director said the two organisations are committed to promoting quality standards at all levels by creating a network of facilities that offer affordable quality healthcare. She said the agreement is an essential building block in taking quality standards in Kenya to the next level. Prior to the establishment of SafeCare, there was no practical way to measure the quality of clinics in resource restricted settings. Preexisting methods for rating healthcare services that are commonly used in wealthier countries are prohibitively expensive and impractical to apply in sub-Saharan Africa. SafeCare is the brainchild of the PharmAccess Foundation of the Netherlands, the Joint Commission International (JCI) of the US and the Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa (COHSASA). SafeCare helps measure and improve the quality of healthcare services in resource-restricted settings. It helps rate healthcare providers and allows for benchmarking across the health system. It enables governments to regulate delivery of care, creates trust in the health system and reduces risk for investors. It also enables patients to prepay for services by providing reliable information on the quality, efficiency and safety of the services that are being offered.
