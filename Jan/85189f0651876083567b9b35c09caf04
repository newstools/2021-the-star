The government has warned Mavoko residents against engaging in illegal quarrying. Athi River deputy county commissioner Charles Wambugu said only those with approval from Nema and licences from Machakos county government would be allowed to undertake quarrying. Quarrying in the area mainly involves extraction of murram and stones for building. “We have reports that some of those carrying out these activities do not have relevant documents,” he said. Wambugu spoke during a subcounty security meeting in his office on Saturday. He said they have formed a team to ensure those engaging in quarrying in Athi River subcounty have the required approvals. Wambugu said the committee will start work immediately to identify and verify levels of compliance. “As you are aware, before you embark on quarrying and mining activities you are supposed to engage the public through public participation and get a licence and approvals based on the outcome of the environmental impact assessment report.” He said those quarrying on private land should engage Nema and county government offices so that they can midwife the public participation process necessary for the acquisition of licences. Among those present during the meeting were Athi River subcounty police commander George Kashimiri and assistant county commissioners Dennis Ongaga (Mlolongo), George Orina (Daystar) and Elizabeth Kairitu (Lukenya). Wambugu also cautioned residents against encroaching on government land. “We are saying if you are on government land, and you are carrying out quarrying and mining activities, we are coming for you and we will prosecute you." He said they have arrested several people and confiscated machinery in Ngelani village over illegal quarrying. “Necessary legal procedures are on course. They were carrying out the activities on somebody’s land without having the necessary approvals,” he said.
