The United Nations has urged developed countries to fulfil their annual pledge of Sh10.1 trillion to support mitigation and adaptation to climate change in developing nations. “We need to see adequate international support so that African economies and other developing countries’ economies can transition to a clean, sustainable energy pathway,” UN Secretary General António Guterres said on Monday. He said that to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, there is an urgent need to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Guterres said all nations need to be able to provide clean and renewable energy that prevents the dangerous heating of the planet. He asked for a strong commitment from all governments to end fossil fuel subsidies, put a price on carbon, shift taxation from people to pollution, and end the construction of coal-fired power plants. This could complicate Kenya's bid to put up two coal power plants in Lamu and Mui basin. Guterres said all public and private financing should support the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with training, reskilling and providing new opportunities that are just and inclusive. Kenya ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016. On December 24, 2020, Kenya submitted the national determined contributions detailing how the country intends to curb emissions. Environment PS Chris Kiptoo said Kenya’s greenhouse gas emissions represent less than one per cent of total global emissions. The country's economy is however heavily dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, energy, tourism, wildlife, and health.
