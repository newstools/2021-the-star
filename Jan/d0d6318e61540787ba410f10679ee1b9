Kenya on Wednesday recorded 123 new cases of Covid-19 from a sample size of 4,948 tested in the last 24 hours, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said. A student is among the new cases, with Kagwe saying the case may have originated from home as the father tested positive. He urged parents to keep their children at home if they suspect they are positive. This now brings the total number of positive cases in the country to 98,555, with the cumulative tests now standing at 1,102,595. Meanwhile, Kenya received health workers returning from the Seychelles. "We will engage other governments that will want our services. We have been approached by overseas Governments to support them using our personnel," Kagwe said. "Because of our advanced training, many institutions, sometimes we have excess capacity of personnel." The country's fatalities have risen to 1,720 after another four patients succumbed to the disease. Kagwe said that there are 675 patients currently admitted in various hospitals across the country. Another, 1,945 patients are on the home-based care programme. A total of 26 patients are in ICU, out of which 17 are on ventilatory support. Also, 14 patients are separately on supplementary oxygen, out of which 11 are in general wards and three in the HDU.
