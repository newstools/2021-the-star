Madtraxx, aka Maddy, says they changed the game from doing Genge music to Gengetone. Maddy is from the musical group Kansoul, alongside Mejja (Okonkwo) and producer KidKora. In a recent interview with Kiss FM, Madtraxx said the group is still in existence. "We changed the game. You guys thought Gengetone came juzi and we have been doing 'Nyongwa' ever since," he said. "We crafted and are the architects of the game you think is so hot right now. We have been doing this for a while. It was designed by people like Nonini. Do you think the talk on nasty things started today? "I am telling you The Kansoul wasn't just about me, Mejja and Kora. We are like a movement, we are creating services that people need. We make you go to the club and dance your a** off." He said they will be releasing more content this year.
