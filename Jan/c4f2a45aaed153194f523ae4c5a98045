Nandi Governor Stephen Sang is set to appear today in a Kisumu court for the hearing of a case in which he has been charged with destroying tea bushes and incitement to violence. In June 2019, the governor was charged with malicious damage of property and incitement to violence that led to the destruction of Sh2 million tea bushes in Kibware estate on June 8th. For the incitement charge, Sang is accused of saying, "You members of the public arm yourselves and deal with anyone who interferes or enters repossessed land which was earlier grabbed by Kibware Tea Farm." He was also charged with abuse of office by authorising the use of two county tractors to destroy tea bushes at the firm. The governor denied the charges before Kisumu resident magistrate Beryl Omollo. He was released on a Sh1 million bond and alternative bail of Sh500,000. Earlier, chief magistrate Julius Ngar Ngar referred the case to Omollo, saying he could not handle the matter based on his relationship with the accused. Before being arraigned in court Governor Sang spent the night at Central police station after attempts by county officials and leaders to have him released failed.
