The Law Society of Kenya has moved to court seeking to block the possible swearing-in of Anne Kananu as Nairobi Governor. Also sought is an order to suspend her swearing-in to the office of deputy governor which happened last Friday. The society believes that the hurried swearing-in of Kananu to the office is illegal and a brazen attempt to undermine the process of a by-election as required by the Constitution. The office of Nairobi governor became vacant after the previous holder Mike Mbuvi Sonko was impeached last December. Kananu on Monday morning took over as Nairobi acting Governor three days after she was sworn in as deputy governor. Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura officially handed over the instruments of power to Kananu in a brief ceremony at City Hall. Mutura said since Nairobi now has a substantive Deputy Governor in office he has relinquished his acting Governor capacity and resumes his full duties as Speaker. Last Friday,  the Appointments Committee led by Majority Leader Abdi Guyo vetted and approved Kananu, saying she had cleared by KRA, EACC and had a degree and fulfilled other requirements for the job. In her first speech as DG, Kananu said she will work tirelessly and together with the Nairobi Metropolitan Service boss Major General Mohammed Badi to ensure all transferred functions are further strengthened to ensure services are delivered.
