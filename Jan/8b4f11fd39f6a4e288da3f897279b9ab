ODM leader Raila Odinga has challenged Deputy President William Ruto to explain to Kenyans what befell the ambitious Jubilee promises he made in the run-up to the 2017 elections. The opposition chief said it is dishonest of Ruto to start campaigning on the hustler narrative before delivering the promises he made to Kenyans. He said the change of the narrative by the DP is evidence enough that he cannot be trusted to deliver to Kenyans when elected. "They promised many things in six months," Raila said on Sunday. "Now they have forgotten, they are saying they now care about the youths and the poor. What happened to the promises of stadia?" He cited laptops to for primary school children, one million jobs, 47 modern stadia and 100km of tarmac road as some of the unfulfilled Jubilee promises. Raila was speaking during a church service at Soweto Catholic in Embakasi East Constituency. He was accompanied ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna, are MP Babu Owino, Maina Kamanda (nominated), Junet Mohammed (Suna East), Sam Atandi (Alego Isinga), Pamela Odhiambo (Migori MP), Antony Oluoch (Mathare), Florence Mutua (Busia MP) and Godfrey Osotsi (nominated).Others were George Aladwa (Makadara), Esther Passaris (Nairobi MP), Raphael Wanjala (Budalangi) and Millie Odhiambo (Suba North). On Friday, Ruto reiterated that he will continue with his hustler narrative, adding 'every hustle counts'. "We will not buy your threats... saying you will bring DCI, KRA, EACC.... We will not go back. Kenya belongs to everyone and work is work," he said. The DP also reiterated his message that Kenya should not be divided on tribal lines. "There are people who were not happy Jubilee was uniting people and they hatched a plan to split the party so that Kenya is split. Even if they split the party, Kenya's unity will not be divided," he said.
