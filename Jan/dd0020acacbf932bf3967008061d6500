AÂ  man and his 22-year-old daughter have been arrested by police in Kamwanya village, Githunguri, for allegedly hacking his mother to death. Beatrice Wangare, a 72-year-old retired teacher, was brutally murdered on August 22 last year. Police visited the scene, took the body to the mortuary and initiated investigations. The granny was buried five days later. She was stabbed to death in her sitting room. Her family pushed the police to investigate and arrest her killers. However, the probe has taken a new twist after her son Patrick Gatimu turned himself in at Githunguri police station and surrendered the knives he said he, alongside his daughter Mercy Wangare, used to kill his mother. Detectives from the Githunguri DCI offices, led by their boss Michael Kimilu, visited their home again to comb the crime scene for new leads. It was then that they arrested Mercy. They spent eight hours digging out a place where they also recovered more clothes and weapons that the two allegedly used in the murder. Deputy subcounty police commander George Kipkoros said investigations are still ongoing. He said the exhibits - a pair of shoes, clothes and iron bar - recovered from two toilets will help them unravel the killing. He thanked the public for assisting them to dig out the toilet. Residents expressed shock when they learnt of the incident. Jane Wanja said the family had blamed the death on thugs and had even contemplated hiring guards to protect their homes.
