ODM leader Raila Odinga continued with his tours to popularise BBI on Saturday. He was at Ufungamano House, accompanied with other ODM leaders, including Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, who is also the co-chair of the BBI secretariat, Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris and Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo. Raila has been on a BBI popularisation frenzy. He has met several groups including youths and women leaders. On Wednesday, he met traders at Burma market. Raila has hinted at a plan to mount a joint countrywide charm offensive with President Uhuru Kenyatta during the 2020 presidential run. He said they will be targeting the grassroots in what is seen as a strategy to turn the tables on Deputy President William Ruto. The handshake partners have started their quest by rallying ODM and Jubilee youth leaders to work together to campaign for the Building Bridges Initiative, starting with Nairobi. Raila, who this week met 800 young people from Nairobi, said the President was aware of the meeting and that he had given his blessings. “I spoke the other day with my brother Uhuru and agreed that we bring together the Nairobi youths,” he said. “We agreed that we should first speak with the Nairobi youth and bring together the Jubilee and ODM youths so that we can start the journey together.” They will move around constituencies, wards, villages, and households to map support for BBI.
