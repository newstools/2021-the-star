 Residents of Nora in Msambweni subcounty, Kwale county have raised an alarm over the increase of poisonous snakes in the area. The residents said the snakes pose a great danger to their lives as they roam around homesteads in search of food. Led by Esther Kaluki, the residents said the reptiles attack livestock and people. She said they have incurred huge losses after cows and chicken died from snake bites. “A lot of my chicken were killed, eggs eaten and some cattle succumbed to the poisonous venom while grazing,” Kaluki said. Most of the snakes are cobras, pythons, puff adders, black and green mambas. She said due to the growth of Nguluku Forest after neighbours were relocated to pave way for mining activities, the number of wild animals has multiplied. Kaluki said they were surrounded by the forest and their homesteads have become the centre of attraction for the starving wildlife. Mwachuphi Juma said snakes sometimes fall from the roofs at night giving residents sleepless nights. “It’s very scary because oftentimes snakes would drop on your bed while asleep,” he said. Juma said they are living by God’s grace. He said children were more vulnerable. He said farming activities have been disrupted with cobras often scaring away farmers. Juma said he escaped death after a cobra tried to attack him as he drove his cattle home from grazing. The residents now want the Kenya Wildlife Service to intervene. Ngema Ali expressed fear that they might starve if the animals won’t be controlled. He said they solely depend on farming but snakes and other animals have disrupted activities. Last year, a 23-year-old Masinde Muliro University student died after being bitten by a snake in Lunga-Lunga. Another 27-year-old man was attacked by a cobra in Matuga.
