Waterbuck are one of those species in the Nairobi National Park that are not often seen and are, therefore, not really predictable on their exact location. I do know they are seen most often in the Langata forest and along the Athi River basin, but even then, they can be elusive. So it is always pleasant to have a surprise sighting, as I did a few days ago. As I drove through the Langata forest into an area with tall trees and open green glades, two males were resting peacefully, and one was so relaxed that he continued to remain lying down as I watched them. They were both magnificent in the early morning light, with full bodies and strong, thick curved horns. Seeing them in this unlikely location made me wonder, just how much do they wander in the park? There are two species of waterbuck found in Africa. The species found in the Nairobi National Park is an interbred mix of the Defassa waterbuck, and the Common or Ellipsen waterbuck. This is unique as there are only three places in Africa where the sub-species have interbred. The easiest way to tell the difference is to look at the white markings on their rear. In the Defassa, this is almost entirely white, while in the Common or Ellipsen waterbuck, there is a clear white ring, as if they had sat on a toilet seat with wet white paint! The Nairobi National Park waterbuck show variations of both sub-species in their markings. The rear markings are possibly used as locators for waterbuck to see each other, either in the dark, or when following at speed. Their fur is oily and has a unpleasant pungent odour, that repels insects. Next time you are in the park, keep a good look out for them in the forested wet areas, but also be prepared for the unexpected.
