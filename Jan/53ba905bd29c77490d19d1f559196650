To make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely. The Nairobi Metropolitan Services plans to turn the Globe Roundabout into a bus terminus (see P23). This is not a new idea - City Hall proposed the same thing in October 2019, six months before the establishment of the NMS. The difference is that NMS is making things happen. Everyone agrees that we need a better public transport system to reduce traffic congestion in the city. It will be a big help to have bus parks in easy walking distance of the CBD in places like Globe Roundabout and Railway Club. The NMS worked with the Ministry of Lands to access these parcels of land but it was made easier because they are both arms of the central government The public agrees that NMS has been doing a very good job since it took over the Roads, Transport, Health and Disaster functions of Nairobi county. However the final version of the BBI Bill published in November stated that the county will recover these functions in 2022 and the NMS will be disbanded. Let the NMS keep on improving Nairobi. If it was a good idea to create NMS, surely it makes sense to keep it. Quote of the day: "To make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely."
