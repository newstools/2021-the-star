The victims' bodies bore wounds that were similar in measurements and depth according to an autopsy report. The autopsy conducted on Monday showed that the stab wounds on the  bodies measured between three and four millimeters The results also showed that the body of the construction worker had blunt object trauma besides the stab wounds. “It appears the assailant found the victim unaware while he could have been asleep.
