The Ng’ombeni police station has been hailed for reducing insecurity in Matuga subcounty. A police survey shows that development is slowly picking up in the area compared to the past. County police commander Joseph Nthenge said the station, which was built for Sh3 million and was launched in August last year, has largely assisted in restoring law and order. “Locals are feeling secure because of the quick police response and frequent patrols in tackling criminal activities,” he said. Nthenge said the police station has served its intended purpose of bringing serenity. “We have pleasing news that some businessmen are asking for plots to start income-generating activities,” he said. The officer attributed the calmness to the cooperation between residents and police. He told locals to continue to offer assistance to security agencies in uprooting the vice and enhancing the county security. Ng’ombeni is among areas that used to be known as hideouts for al Shabaab recruiters. The area is also known as the hideout of small gangs consisting of youth between aged 12-17 years who terrorise locals with pangas. The gangs had once led resistance against constructing the Ng’ombeni police station. Matuga MP Kassim Tandaza said with the help of fearless village elders and various security agencies, the facility was built. In December, NCIC acting CEO Millicent Okatch said the commission's monitoring report indicated that there was calm in areas that were previously known as insecurity hotspots. Ng’ombeni was one of them.
