Popular DJ Joe Mfalme is excited to be joining Homeboyz Radio after leaving Capital FM. Speaking to Word Is yesterday, Mfalme said he cannot wait to take the next journey of his career. "I'm always up for new challenges," he said. Mfalme joins Michael Waithaka and former general manager Somoina Kimojino, who have also joined the Radio Africa Group-owned station. In a statement, the celebrated mix master had announced that he had exited the uptown radio station after over 10 years of service. He said it wasn't an easy decision. "That is the only place I have worked at apart from my TV shows and side gigs. It wasn't easy but you know change has to be there." He admits he was approached by other stations and only settled for Homeboyz since it matches his style and vibe. "I just love good vibes. And that is what fans should expect, good vibes and great music." Speaking about the music that has been trending, Mfalme said that for him, it is about going with the flow. "Right now guys are listening to a lot of pope smoke, drill dancehall... and Kenyan music is doing very well," he said. "Music is very unpredictable and at times you don't know the style that is going to come in next year. So my job as a DJ is to just do the research on music and go with the flow. "I'm just sailing with the flow. I'm just hoping this year guys will have the same energy as what they did last year." He is set to start working at the station next month on the breakfast show.
