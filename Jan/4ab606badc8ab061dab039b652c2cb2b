The government has put on notice coffee society managers who borrow loans on behalf of farmers without following due process. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya said such moves have caused untold miseries to farmers whose assets end up being auctioned to recover the debts. He said such incidents are mostly orchestrated by rogue society managers in collusion with predator lenders with exorbitant interest rates so they benefit from the transactions. “The government will crack down on those who auction farmers’ properties with an aim of recovering loans. Some delay farmers’ payment intentionally so the interest can accrue over time.” He said such incidents have led to the collapse of many coffee societies, warning that the government will not only take legal action against perpetrators but also force them to clear the debts. “The government has written off so many debts emanating from societies that have sunk low because of financial constraints. That is one of the reasons the government created the Cherry Advance Revolving Fund and the Commodities Fund, which attract low-interest rates.” Munya spoke at Kerugoya Stadium while wrapping up his three-day visit over public participation on coffee reforms bill. He directed the county head of cooperatives to ensure all coffee farmers register under the Cherry Advance Revolving Fund within the next two weeks. Early this week, the CS warned the government will not tolerate societies' management boards that do not comply with its call to register members under the initiative. He said all farmers, irrespective of the mills they work with, can be members under the programme, which attracts a three per cent interest rate. As part of the ongoing coffee reforms that are established with an aim of overhauling the sector, the CS also cited the government’s commitment to systematically digging for the truth to unearth institutions and contributors who led to the collapse of the sector.
