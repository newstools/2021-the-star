Kenya and the other new members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) have officially taken their positions. The ceremony took place on Monday evening at the UNSC permanent building in New York City, US. Kenya was represented by its Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Martin Kimani. The ambassador said that following the installation, the country will be a bold voice for Kenyans, Africa, and all peoples yearning for peace and security "Deeply touched and honoured to represent the great people and country of Kenya in planting our flag at the door of the UN Security Council! We will be a bold voice for Kenya, Africa, and all peoples yearning for peace and security." Kenya will serve in the UNSC for a two-year term. Other countries installed alongside Kenya to the UNSC include India, Ireland, Mexico, and Norway. Kenya won the non-permanent seat in June 2020, garnering 129 votes in the second round against Djibouti. Djibouti got 62 votes after forcing the second voting by denying Kenya the win in the first round.
