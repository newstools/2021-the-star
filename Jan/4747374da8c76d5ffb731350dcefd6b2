Zetech Sparks have worked on the poor communication between defence and goalkeeping and are ready to face Makolanders. The two teams entertain each other today at Ruiru grounds in the Kenya Women Premier League. Zetech coach Bernard Kitolo said  the two areas needed to be addressed after conceding three goals from set pieces against Kayole Starlets on Sunday despite winning the match 4-3. This was Zetech's first win of the season. Kitolo said they want to build consistency with another win over their opponents even as he tries to instil mental strength and work on player endurance. "Set pieces were a major problem against Kayole but we've tried to see how best we can deal with them. There was no communication in the defensive department and have also addressed that. I call for mental toughness from the team." His opposite number Mike Okanga said survival is paramount for his charges and they will take a step at a time. Makolanders have won, drawn and lost one match a piece with four points ahead of their fourth fixture. Okanga said the introduction of prize money has made the league competitive,  making it difficult to predict the outcome of any match. "Anything is possible in any match but avoiding relegation is our aim. The WPL is cut-throat but we aim for better results. Every team wants to win and I love the competition." The match kicks off at 2:00 pm.
