World 800m bronze medalist Ferguson Rotich will consider competing in the 1500m race category after the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. Rotich believes he can successfully follow in the footsteps of other 800m specialists who have excelled in 1500m. “After 800m, my next focus is to compete in the 1,500m or 1000m because I believe I am physically at the level where I can excel in both. But, first, let us see if I can make it to the Tokyo Olympics,” Rotich said. Furthermore, the 2014 4x800m relay gold medalist has not ruled out an assault at the road race if his body allows it. “If I clinch a medal at the Olympics, I would not mind transitioning into the half or full marathon. However, this will only depend on whether I am in the right physical condition to attempt it,” Rotich, who set a season best of 1:44.16 at the Wanda Diamond League in Doha last year, said. Turning his attention to the Tokyo Olympics, Rotich chose to be modest with his targets, saying an appearance in the 800m final will be ‘mission accomplished’ for him. “Considering the level of competition in the 800m, my target will be to make it to the final. Afterwards, I will be able to gauge my chances of a podium finish based on the competition around me,” he said. He bemoaned the impact of Covid-19 on athletes’ training and preparations for major competitions. “Training has been complicated because of this pandemic but most athletes have had no choice but to adapt to the circumstances,” Rotich said. He was speaking at the Nyayo Stadium on Saturday after winning Heat Six of the 400m men’s race during the 2nd leg of the Athletics Kenya Relay Series. Rotich clocked 48.68 to finish first ahead of Vincent Kosgei and Geoffrey Kapelo who finished second and third respectively in 49.00 and 49.40. He was among beneficiaries of a financial boost from National Olympic Committee-Kenya in the past week under the Association of National Olympic Committees scholarship scheme. Each of the athletes received Sh400,000 from NOC-K.
