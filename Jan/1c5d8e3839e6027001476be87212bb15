Mathare United players and staff underwent a Covid-19 test yesterday morning before the resumption of their Kenya Premier League match against Sofapaka this Saturday in Wundanyi. KPL was initially suspended in March 13 last year as a measure to curb the spread of Covid-19 after the country reported its first case of the pandemic. Regular Covid-19 testing of all players and staff was one of the conditions set by Kenya’s ministries of health and sport before the resumption of the league. Clubs welcomed the move by FKF to foot the costs of testing, as they pledged to observe the protocols in place to prevent the spread of the disease. While Mathare, who are sponsored by Triple5bet, start their season this weekend, the rest of the teams will have played six games already. This means that the Slum Boys will have to try and catch up, as most of their fixtures have been congested into a two-week period. Slum Boys will enjoy Triple5bet sponsorship for  the next five years. Mathare host to Zoo FC on January 18 and Bandari on January 22nd. Two more matches against Ulinzi Stars in Nakuru (January 27) and Tusker (January 31) will follow.
