Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has warned politicians who might have been behind Kapedo killings that their days are numbered. Addressing journalists after a meeting with North Eastern leaders on Tuesday, Matiang'i said the death of an officer during the attack was premeditated. On Monday, Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya said bandits had crossed a red line by killing a law enforcement officer. "Our senior police officer was murdered, there was no conflict, it was a clear case of a premeditated, planned ambush that was targeting our GSU deputy director of operations,‚Äù Matiang'i said. Matiang'i said that the culprits should surrender before they meet the law. "We will go for them no matter how long it will take us. Some people have done that, including leaders and I need to emphasize that. They have gotten away with that kind of behaviour for far too long," he said. "There is a culture in that part of our country which seeks to protect negative and criminal armament that disguises as cattle rustling but in actual fact, it is funded. We are in hot pursuit of certain people including leaders," he said. Matiang'i said that those involved are facilitated to meet with the law adding that by the time they are done, it would be a story to be told generations to come. Since 2014, more than 40 people, including 21 GSU officers, have been killed, many injured and thousands of animals stolen by bandits in Kapedo. But according to 2013 IEBC report the contested Kapedo political unit lies in Napeitom ward of Turkana East constituency. On Monday, Pokot gunmen from Tiaty subcounty, Baringo, stormed Kapedo, killing a 70-year old Turkana man, Ekayapan Edung. Turkana county police commander Samuel Ndanyi said three others were injured and 10 houses were torched during the attack.
