Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists' Union (KMPDU) has condemned the move taken by the County Government of Mombasa to sack 86 doctors. On Wednesday, Mombasa issued a statement indicating that 86 doctors have been dismissed following the failure to report to their work stations. The union's Acting secretary general Chibanzi Mwachonda is among the dismissed doctors. Following the dismissal, the union has demanded the reinstatement of the doctors to their duties. "KMPDU demands for the immediate reinstatement of the doctors and establishment of the Constitutional Health Service Commission to standardise management of Human resources for health and bring sanity to the health sector in Kenya," Mwachonda said. Acting SG said that all 250 doctors in Mombasa have been on strike since December 2, 2020, for non-implementation 2017-2021 CBA. He added that the Return-To-Work Formula which was signed on December 2, 2020, between the KMPDU Coast branch and the County Government of Mombasa has not been honoured. The Return-To-Work Formula had touched on doctors' promotions, career progressions, failure to remit statutory and Third-Party deductions, and persistent salary delays. The union has further called upon Nyamira and Migory county governments to resolve the ongoing strike. The county government of Mombasa directed the dismissed doctors to hand over all the properties belonging to the County Government to their supervisors. Also, the administration has have enclosed their letters and advance copies have been shared to their mail. "Kindly ensure the above doctors receive their letters and immediately update us on the progress of the dissemination of the letters, handover, and staff return for each of the facilities."
