Showmax and Canal+ have begun production on 'Crime and Justice', a gritty police procedural and legal show set in Nairobi. The series features Hassan and Alfred Munyua, starring as Makena and Silas, the two detectives at the heart of the topical show that follows one ripped-from-the-headlines case per episode through to the courtroom verdict. Speaking about it, Munyua said he loved the delivery and realness of Silas as a character. "It’s not exaggerated and he’s no Rambo hero; he just tackles his cases the normal way. I found a very real edge with this script, and I hope I’ll do justice to the role." Sarah Hassan says she is looking forward to playing a detective for the first time in her career. "This is a very different character; I’ve never played anything like Makena before. It’s very exciting to get a character that makes me grow as an actor." Hassan and Munyua are joined by other thespians, including Maqbul Mohammed as DCI Boss Kebo, Paul Ogola as Prosecutor Sokoro and Brian Ogola as Caleb, the resident pathologist, as well as the stage and screen legend John Sibi-Okumu. Working alongside Adam in the production team is an all-star Kenyan crew. While this is the first Kenyan Showmax Original, it is not the first foray into original Kenyan content for the MultiChoice Group, Showmax’s parent company. Yolisa Phahle, CEO of MultiChoice Connected Video, said they are fundamentally an African business and are invested in telling African stories that reflect the lives, languages and cultures of the continent. "We believe in African talent and look forward to shining the international spotlight on not only Kenyan stars but the Kenyan technical industry’s capabilities." Crime and Justice follows the announcement of the first Canal+ and MultiChoice co-production, 'Blood Psalms', which will premiere on Showmax this year.
