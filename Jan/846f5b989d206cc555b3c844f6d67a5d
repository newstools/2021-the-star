Deputy President William Ruto has read the act to his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta for dragging back the country to what he said are the backward politics of tribalism. Ruto said he thrice supported Uhuru knowing well that he was from the Kikuyu community and was the son of a former President. Speaking at the House of Hope Church in Kayole on Sunday, Ruto said the next head of state will be elected on their policies and not based on their ethnicity. He hit out at the handshake brigade saying there are some waiting to be given the presidency in boardrooms and bars “I supported Uhuru not because of his tribe. I supported him not because he was representing his tribe,” Ruto said. The DP was reacting to President Kenyatta who declared on Saturday that maybe its time to support a candidate outside Mount Kenya and the Kalenjin community. Uhuru said that Kenya has been led by only two communities since independence and that it might be the time for other communities that have not tasted leadership to take over. "Ata mimi naweza simama hapa an niseme kuna jamii tu mbili za Kenya ambazo zimetawala. Labda ni nafasi ya jamii nyengine pia kutawala. Jamii za Kenya ni mingi," Uhuru said. The President those who feel tired with his leadership are free to seek a new chance through the ballot. "Politics should not be based on the tribal basis but on ideologies and sober agendas that can move this nation ahead," the President said. The president further said the handshake was meant to unite the nation after the heightened political temperatures that were brought about by the disputed 2017 elections. He said the handshake was not meant to bar others from their political positions as it is being propagated.
