Entrepreneur and music producer Tedd Josiah has revealed the last words of his late wife Reginah Katar. Reginah died in 2017, three months after welcoming her daughter Wendo. In a long post on Instagram, Tedd wrote that his wife told him to carry their newborn daughter, Jameela Wendo, as she was getting heavy. He added that his wife’s last words provoke thought, especially at a time of immense struggle. "Impossible to raise you without seeing your mother looking at me through your eyes. Hard to carry you into bed every night (cause you're becoming bigger and heavier), but your mama’s very last words were, 'Please carry the baby, she’s getting heavy for me'." "Those words play in my head every day I feel the world is getting hard on us. Still a mighty long way to go. Still a Queen to raise into a loving strong leader... Still a legacy to keep alive. Still love to share. Forever for always for love." In a past interview with Word Is, Tedd said staying focused on his daughter and making a living to make her happy is the biggest challenge he has faced. "Most of the time I need to be doing business, I am with her since we do not have a permanent house manager," he said. "Sometimes when clients want to purchase our products and have conversations with me, she also needs my attention."
