Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has condemned what he termed a "premeditated, cold-blooded, heinous attack" on security personnel who were on a routine security mission in Kapedo. The attack, which took place between Kapedo and Chemolingot in Baringo County at Amaya center at 4:30pm on Sunday, led to the killing of GSU Deputy Operations Director, Emadau Temako, and left two other officers injured. Temako was leading an operation in Kapedo. Matiang’i on Monday said preliminary investigations had revealed that the ambush took place against the backdrop of a ritual ceremony in which organised bandits were intentionally charged and adjured by some traditional leaders in a form of a cultural ceremony. He said the the Inspector General Hilary Mutyambai had since launched an unprecedented operation in the area. "We will not relent until all the perpetrators, including the elders who administered the oath and sent off the killers are surrendered and brought to justice," he said in a statement. “This operation will be extensive and sustained as we meticulously comb through every nook and cranny in the area until we find the last criminal." The CS said the region has claimed the lives of several security officers and citizens. “It is extremely unfortunate that extraordinary efforts to find a lasting solution to the security challenges and breakdowns in peace between the Pokot and Turkana communities continue to face serious resistance from leaders, who have been patronizing the deadly attacks in pursuit of criminal and selfish interests,” he said. He appealed to the locals to work closely with security officers as part of the efforts to change the national security doctrines in the area and address the escalating attacks. More personnel have since been sent to the area to hunt down the attackers.
