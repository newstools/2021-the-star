Interior PS Karanja Kibicho has dared former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to provide evidence to back his claims regarding his stage-managed chaos claims against ODM during the 2017 polls. “Enough is enough. I did not get to the DCI as the Interior PS but as Kibicho and Sonko shall give me answers if there is law in this country. Where were we with him?” Kibicho said on Monday. "He must prove one by one because I am a Kenyan who deserves to be treated properly as well. Enough is enough. Sonko will provide me answers. He better prepare some good lawyer… he will have to deal with character assassination as well  and I am going for libel this week.” Earlier, Kibicho was at the DCI headquarters to record a statement over Sonko's remarks. Sonko claimed that in 2017 during ODM demonstrations, he and Kibicho, and printed ODM T-shirts. "We then bought second-hand vehicles and burnt them so that people would say it's ODM. It was the deep state and the system," he said. Sonko made the allegations on Sunday when he accompanied Deputy President William Ruto as he visited Dagoretti. Meanwhile, ODM has demanded a full inquiry into the claims. Secretary general Edwin Sifuna on Monday said the inquiry into the matter should establish the motives and extent of the "mafia-like covert criminal acts" as well as all persons and institutions involved. While admitting that it is fine for Sonko to express himself, the PS said that it is wrong to make some of the serious allegations against people, where some are criminal in nature. "It is not okay for Sonko to continue making wild allegations around people, some are of a serious criminal in nature and get away with it." He added that Sonko's remarks have indicated that he has no respect for the laws, adding that his allegations have already disturbed a number of people. "You make allegations that you are sure you can prove in the court of law."
