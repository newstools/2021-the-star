Mugithi star Mighty Salim who succumbed to kidney failure on Sunday evening, will be buried on February 2 in Subukia. Musician Kamande wa Kioi said on Wednesday the funeral service will be held at Subukia market park. The burial will later be held in Arash, a few kilometres from Subukia market. Kamande said artists and friends will hold a final farewell concert at Dragon lounge in Githurai 44 to celebrate his life. Mighty Salim was a younger brother to the late Salim Junior who died in 2016. Kamande said Salim's music will always be celebrated by generations to come. “When you mention Mugithi, the first person who comes to mind is Salim Junior and Mighty Salim, we will forever keep them in our minds,” he said. In 2019, Mighty had complained that artistes and friends had abandoned him after he failed to raise Sh2.5 million for treatment. "When an artiste dies, you are the first to announce and send messages of condolences. I have been to all your stations and made many calls asking for help. I might not succeed or live forever...," he posted on social media. He said a popular politician from Mt Kenya had given him fake cheques. Mighty Salim has left behind a wife and four children. Friends and family members are meeting daily at Blue spring hotel along Thika road.
