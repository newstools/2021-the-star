A medical scientist is slowly becoming a brand name in Meru through the songs he composes when not handling patient’s specimens. Joel Muthaura, 27, stage name Young Boy Joez, promotes Ameru tradition and culture through his music, alongside his microbiology duties at the Nkubu Consolata Hospital in Meru. “Even if you are the best doctor, you cannot earn a million in hours like it is with artistes, even if it’s replacing kidney," he said. Joez used to sing his own songs in high school and college. He released his first song in 2015. It didn’t do well, though it cost him Sh15,000 he had earned from burning charcoal. Now signed on YEB Mt Kenya records label, he has written several other songs and produced his first video, 'Kabongo Bongo 2020'. He aims to be a Bongo musician and looks up to Otile Brown and Masauti Boy.
