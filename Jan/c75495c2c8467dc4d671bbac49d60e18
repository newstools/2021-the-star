Gospel singer Mr Seed has hit back at controversial singer Ringtone Apoko, who trashed his upcoming project with Gengetone group 'Sailors'. Mr Seed asked Ringtone to refrain from judging others after accusing him of diluting the gospel by collaborating with secular artistes. Ringtone wrote, "Stop this nonsense, just go to secular, Mr Seed. That your stupid song you want to release with Sailors, Christians will not consume. Bure kabisa, lubbish." Mr Seed, responded asking him to stop being judgmental, saying nobody is righteous and only God can judge. "Industry ya gospel imekuwa na issues, tumekuwa na a lot of judging badala ya ku support, fighting badala ya kusupport. Mtu akitakuchange akuwe a gospel artiste, tunamjudge, badala ya kumsikiza tunamjudge, which is not right," he wrote. "We are not God. We are not supposed to judge anyone na decision yenye amemake. …For me ku support Lexy from Sailors venye ameamua kufanya gospel imekuwa tena shida. "My friend, you are not God. First of all, God did not come for the church, God alikuja kwa wale watu hawamjui. Wewe unamjua ni sawa, but stop judging others, stop fighting others, it’s not right." Lexxy Young of the famous group Sailors has switched to gospel, saying he has opted to serve God.
