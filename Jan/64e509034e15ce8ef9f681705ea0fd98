Drug abuse is the major cause of the recent burning of churches at Otamba area in Nyarabari Chache, Kisii clerics have said. Speaking to journalists in his office, chairman of the Kisii Evangelical Churches of Kenya Bishop Charles Isaboke asked security agents to conduct a swoop on the affected areas and arrest those using illicit drugs. Two of the 10 suspects suspects who had been seized on Tuesday had rolls of bhang. On Wednesday the church officials said more suspects could still be at large. “It is not the two suspects that police said found bhang with, there are more others, possibly in hundreds who are also trapped in the vice. It is time we had a multi-agency mop up if we are to arrest the situation before it gets out of hand‚”  Isaboke said. He, however, said they should be taken to rehabilitation centres for counselling. Isaboke further appealed to chiefs to get rid of illicit brews in villages. He said it is on the altar of broken societies that deviants are born. “Let us all rise and say no to these vices in our midst. Chiefs may not offer solutions alone if we cannot assist in the sharing of intelligence,” he said. On Tuesday, police said they were on the trail of more suspects linked to the church fires. County police boss Jebel Munene said they have already arraigned the first lot of the suspects to face charges. “We are following up useful leads too and you will witness more action in the coming days. We have not rested yet and won't rest until all those linked to the incidents are seized‚” Munene said. He said detectives are going through several names cited as possible suspects during a baraza on Tuesday at Otamba area.   Edited by Kiilu Damaris
