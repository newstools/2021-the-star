Sauti Sol is among artistes who will represent Africa in the #YouTubeBlackVoices Artistes' Class of 2021. The boy band, together with Fireboy DML from Nigeria and South Africaâ€™s Sho Madjozi, are part of 21 artistes selected from across the world to take part in this new initiative dedicated to equipping black artistes with the resources to succeed on the YouTube platform. YouTube's MD Alex says they will work closely with the Class of 2021 to grow the artistes' channels. "This will include dedicated partner support through our team of growth specialists, seed funding invested in the development of their channels, followed by ongoing bespoke training, workshops and networking programmes. We will measure our success by the longer-term, sustained success of these artistes." YouTube is committed to amplifying Black voices and providing a platform where Black African creators and artistes can have a spotlight and continue to centre both their voices and perspectives.
