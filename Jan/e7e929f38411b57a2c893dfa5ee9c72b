Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says he may stay in management much longer than he anticipated. Guardiola, 49, has previously talked of limiting his time in football to pursue other interests. “Before, I thought I was going to retire soon. Now I’m thinking I’m going to retire older. So, I don’t know,” Guardiola said. The Spaniard signed a new two-year deal at City in November and has won six major trophies at the club. Prior to his arrival in Manchester, Guardiola, who turns 50 this month, spent four years as manager of Barcelona and three in charge of Bayern Munich. “Experience helps you, especially the way I live my profession,” he added. Guardiola’s five-year stay at City represents the longest commitment he has made to a club in his management career. He has won two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and three League Cups since joining them in 2016.
