 A police officer was shot dead on Tuesday night during a robbery incident at Landi Mawe within Industrial Area in Nairobi. A robbery suspect was also gunned down. The officer was identified as corporal Mark Kiptui. He was attached to Industrial Area police station. He was with his girlfriend in his car when four gunmen confronted them demanding cash and other valuables. Police said the attack prompted a confrontation that saw Kiptui shot in the head. He died on the spot. He was in civilian clothes and not armed, police said. The gunmen also killed their accomplice. He was also shot in the head as he wrestled with Kiptui. It is not clear if the shooting of the suspect was intentional or accidental, police said. Police believe their colleague was being targeted for an unknown motive. The girlfriend was not injured. Nairobi police boss Rashid Yakub said the gang escaped soon after the shooting incident that happened at about 10pm. “We have lost an officer but we don’t know what the motive was given how this incident happened. A team is investigating it,” Yakub said. The police boss said the bodies were taken to the mortuary. A week ago, gunmen confronted a van escorting cash to a bank and robbed the crew of Sh3.5 million before escaping. No arrest has been made so far. The gang is said to have left much money in the van after picking one box which was empty during the January 18 incident. About Sh14 million was on transit when they attacked the van near City Cabanas off Mombasa Road.  Edited by P.O
