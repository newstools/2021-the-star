A legislator from Kiambu has warned that Deputy President William Ruto's allies will condemn the Central region to a crisis if they continue demeaning the BBI. Limuru MP Peter Mwathi said the region has not been receiving equitable resources, considering its population, which he said is still growing. He urged residents to accept the BBI document, saying even though it allocates only nine additional constituencies, it will change lives. "The constituencies proposed in the BBI document in Kiambu county are not enough, considering its huge and growing population," he said. "We need our people to be represented in a better way; however, let us accept the way the BBI is and we shall improve as we implement it." He says some counties in the country have less than five constituencies, with each having a population less than 20,000, yet in Kiambu county, they range between 80,000 and 150,000 people. Mwathi said the MPs vote in Parliament is only one, adding that it does not matter how many one represents. He, however, urged people from the region to support the Building Bridges Initiative to ensure equitable allocation of public funds. The lawmaker said the funds given to county governments and to each ward, as well as the NG-CDF, will increase almost by 50 per cent. He warned Tangatanga against using the BBI document to fight 2022 election battles, saying it is about the future of this country. He spoke at Nyambare trading centre on Monday after commissioning chiefs' camps at Ngarariga and Ndeiya in his constituency. He urged wananchi not to look at the Sh4 billion that will be used by the IEBC on a referendum. The country loses over Sh10 billion year, but the document will promote prudent use of cash to avoid wastage, he said. Mwathi urged residents to speak in one voice for the sake of development, adding that people appear to be divided because of the ongoing 2022 General Election politics and the BBI.
