Local soccer fans believe teenage midfield sensation Henry Ochieng is equipped with the right ammunition to emulate mercurial striker Michael Olunga on the big stage. Olunga, who currently turns out for Al Duhal in Qatar after a successful spell with Kashiwa Reysol in Japan, has caused a stir in the world of football of late with his outstanding performances and local fans are tipping Ochieng to follow in his footsteps. Ochieng caused a stir in the country on Monday as news trickled in that he had penned a deal with English championship club Watford. “Watford FC are pleased to confirm the signing of U23 midfielder Henry Ochieng,” the club confirmed. Ochieng who is set to join Watford's U-23 side is no stranger to the local football scene given he was handed a maiden senior call-up in November 2017 by former Harambee Stars head coach Stanley Okumbi as the team prepared to face Sierra Leone in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. He, however, missed an opportunity to register his debut after the match was cancelled. He finally made his debut for the U23 side against Mauritius one year later Ochieng attended St Aubyn’s School while growing in Ilford before kicking off his career at Buckhurst Hill Junior team, where he learned the basics of the game. It is at that time that he was scouted by West Ham United in 2009 and moved to sign a two-year deal with Leyton six years later. He made his debut against Brighton U23 side on November 8 in 2016 in their 1-0 loss. The midfielder signed a first professional contract in December and came on as a substitute in their 0-3 loss to Crawley Town in March 2017.
