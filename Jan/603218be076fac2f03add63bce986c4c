The 2021 national basketball league will now tip off after Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) elections, according to assistant secretary Ambrose Kisoi. Kisoi said the league earlier programmed to start this weekend with a 29-game card will now tip off after the elections set for January 23. He said this development was reached after the executive meeting held over the weekend to chart way forward. Kisoi confirmed that already the counties are conducting their polls and all the results will be announced once the exercise is over. KBF fixtures secretary Joseph Amoko had released a 29-match schedule covering the opening weekend. The games were planned for Nyayo Stadium gymnasium, USIU courts, Kisii, Kenyatta Sports Ground, Kisumu and Makande Welfare Hall in Mombasa. “We can’t start the league before having an office in place. We will have team managers' meeting week after the polls to put everything in perspective before we announce the new league dates,” he said. He said they intend cover a wide range of issues during the team managers' meeting. “After the meeting, we will put a date for the pre-season tournament and this will serve as our first event on the calendar,” he noted. The 2020 league was halted in March, just days before it started due to Covid-19 pandemic.
