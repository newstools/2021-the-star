Five members of a family were Wednesday found murdered in their home in Kagongo Karura village, Kiambu county. Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation’s homicide unit were at the scene for the better part of Wednesday as part of the probe. Police termed the incident pure murder as the victims had injuries on their bodies. Witnesses said that the victims are a father, mother, their two children, and a niece. The body of the father was found lying outside the house within the compound while the rest were found inside. The mystery of the murder started Monday when the body of the family’s casual labourer was found at a nearby building with injuries prompting police to launch investigations into the matter. It later emerged the mobile phones of the other family members were not going through. Police and the victims’ neighbours launched a search. This led police investigation to discover the other bodies inside the house on Wednesday morning. The police said that the victims had been murdered with blunt objects. Kiambaa police boss Michael Muchiri said, “This looks pure murder. Experts are on the ground to know what happened and the motive behind it." The bodies were moved to the local mortuary where a postmortem is planned.
