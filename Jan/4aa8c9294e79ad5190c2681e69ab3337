Arsenal vs Manchester United Saturday 8:30 pm Arsenal’s 3-1 victory over Southampton on Tuesday night moved the ‘Gunners’ to within striking distance of the top six and marked a sixth straight league game without defeat. Impressively, four of those victories saw Arsenal beat the -1 handicap in at least one half and/or win both halves — they memorably did the former in last season’s corresponding fixture. Aiming for a first league double over Manchester United since 2006/07, Arsenal swept Newcastle aside 3-0 in their last home league game, despite failing to score before half time for a third competitive home outing in succession. They are unbeaten in four Premier League outings here, with both wins seeing their first and third goals separated by less than 30 minutes of play. Manchester United require only a clean sheet to surpass their now equal-best club run of 17 top-flight away games unbeaten. Despite a shock midweek loss at home to Sheffield United, the second-placed visitors should still be in a confident mood here as they’ve won all seven away league fixtures this term in which they’ve conceded first, on top of averaging 2.40 goals per PL away game so far this campaign. Despite losing the reverse head-to-head, United’s all-time top-flight record against Arsenal is strong, with an average of 2.84 total goals per match (either way) across that entire 114-year old record. A good start is important, as a 72.22 per cent majority (13) of their last 18 Premier League head-to-heads won/lost vs Arsenal have seen the victor on the day lead at HT.

It’s been over three years since Dortmund failed to win four straight top-flight matches, but Augsburg have been something of a bogey team for the hosts, reducing Dortmund to just four wins from the last nine meetings. Playing at home hasn’t been much comfort for Dortmund either, who have won just one of their last five Bundesliga games here. A home win seems important to Dortmund’s UEFA Champions League place aspirations, and if it’s to arrive it will likely be down to their second-half performances. Augsburg have wins away are even more impressive considering the visitors have scored an average of just one goal per Bundesliga road trip this term.

Unsurprisingly then, ‘Le SCO’ have lost all but one of the seven L1 matches in which they trailed at half time this campaign. The hosts will be desperate to avoid conceding first, as Angers have lost five of the six top-flight home fixtures in which they’ve conceded the opener this season.  Five of Angers’ last six L1 home games have seen only one side score, emphasising the importance of scoring first. Visitors Nîmes still sit bottom of the league on goal difference. To optimise their chances of consecutive league wins for the first time this campaign they should keep things tight late on, as nearly half of the L1 goals they’ve conceded arrived after the 70th minute. The visitors may have failed to score in a joint-league worst 50 per cent of their L1 away games this term, but they’ve still claimed 73.33 per cent of their league points on the road.
