A family in Naivasha is appealing to well-wishers to help them raise funds so that their daughter can be operated upon. Hellen Wambui told the Star that her 9-year-old Sharon Wanja needs urgent eye surgery to salvage her sight. According to Wambui, her daughter in grade four now woke up one day with a swollen eye only to develop into a complication. On inquiry, she said a blunt object had hit her. "A few days later, she started complaining that she could not see properly and we sought some medication. Unfortunately, we were told that the injury had caused damage to her eye," Wambui said. According to her, since then Wanja who is partially blind has been on and off medication to help her out. The pain has been on and off but when it is extreme we seek medical attention," she said. Wambui said for the last four years it has been tough for her little daughter, a second born in a family of three. Wambui said when schools resumed, Wanja could not attend school because she complained the pain was too much. We went to see a doctor who referred us to Lions eye hospital in Kangemi. When we visited the hospital, were told the injury was deep and caused great damage to the eye," she said. She added, "The doctor said the eye has contracted an infection and it needs to be removed urgently to salvage the other one". Wambui who is currently residing at a relative's place in Githurai said the entire operation is set to cost about Sh75,000. "The doctor said the eye will no longer see and she needs an urgent replacement. This is why I am appealing to Kenyans of goodwill to help me secure her sight," she said.
