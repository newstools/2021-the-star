Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has announced a reorganisation of security teams in Kericho county in the war on illicit brew. He said the move comes following the rise in the production, sale, and consumption of illicit brew in the area. The CS made the announcement in Kericho on Monday during a security tour. Bureti is among the sub-counties most affected by the illicit brew menace, buhowever other trouble areas are Kericho East and West, Sigowet, Kipkelion West and East. Matiang’i said some locals, including religious leaders had raised concerns regarding the involvement of some administrators and police in the running and/or protection of illegitimate businesses. He announced that the officers who, either through negligence or obstinacy, have been derelict in the performance of their duties will face disciplinary action. “Effective tomorrow, we will begin an operation to clean up areas of this county where consumption of illicit alcohol is high,” Matiang’i said. Matiang’i highlighted the impact of the enforcement gaps on illegal and unregulated gaming and gambling, which he said is fueling various social evils in the region. He added the government’s stance on cleaning up the sector has not changed and called upon Kenyans to support the government’s efforts in this endeavour. The CS directed the Department of Immigration Services to begin a progressive audit of all foreign investors in the county with a view to winnowing out those engaged in illegitimate activities. “If there are any foreigners who may be engaging in these illegal businesses, we will apprehend them and deport them – because that is what the law says.” Matiang’i was accompanied by the Energy CS Charles Keter, Trade CS Betty Maina, Vocational Training PS Alfred Cheruiyot, and Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya among other government officers.
