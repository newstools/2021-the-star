Learners across the country made their way back to school on Monday after nine months away caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 15 million learners are expected back in school. Education CS George Magoha was at Olympic Primary School on Monday, which experienced an influx of pupils, causing him to order more desks for the school. An 140 extra desks will be diverted to the school from a facility which is not experiencing congestion, the CS said. "If we work together... look at the body and spirit of students and teachers, they need encouragement," he said. Magoha said the government has done “everything” to ensure schools are ready to take in learners. Magoha urged he media to paint a positive picture of the reopening, saying it would be of no use to the country if the focus is on "little hitches here and there". At Mwiki Primary School in Githurai, parents sought admission of their children after the closure of some private facilities following the effects of the pandemic. In Kisumu county, students from Ombaka Mixed Secondary School relocated to Ombaka Primary School and were taught in tents after floods marooned their school. The reopening of schools marks the beginning of the Second Term of the school calendar, which will end in mid-March. Magoha said that the government will disburse Sh14 billion for secondary schools by Friday at the latest and more than Sh4 billion for primary schools by Tuesday as capitation funds. There have been calls for more money to be sent to schools since the figure announced by the CS is the normal amount the sector gets, even without the pandemic. Kenya has23,000 public primary schools with more than 12 million pupils and more than three million students in secondary schools. Schools will also be required to have thermal guns and hand washing stations with running water, as well as sanitiser.
