Three traffic police officers from Mutomo sub-county were on Monday arrested for taking bribes from motorists. The suspects who were found with Sh7,000, were told to appear before a Kitui court on February 15 to answer to the charges of taking bribes. The officers were named as Corporal Reuben Rumba, Constable David Ndunda and Constable Pricilla Makena. They were released on Sh20,000 bail each pending appearance before Kitui senior principal magistrate's court. The three were nabbed by EACC officers from Machakos subcounty as they solicited for bribes at Ikutha trading centre along the Kibwezi-Kitui road. A police report from Ikutha police station where the suspects were locked up  indicated that they will be charged with the offence of soliciting and receiving bribes. Martin Kangala, Mutomo subcounty police commander under whose jurisdiction the three were arrested,  was not reachable to expound on the matter as calls to his mobile phone went unanswered. The arrest of the officers comes less than a week after the Kitui County Boda Boda Association officials led by their chairman Kelvin Kivala petitioned Governor Charity Ngilu to protect them from constant harassment by "rent-seeking" traffic police officers.
