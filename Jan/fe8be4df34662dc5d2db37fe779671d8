There has been 99 per cent return of students back to school, Education CS George Magoha has said. Magoha on Friday said most schools have received back all the students. However, there is a small percentage of girls who have not reported back after giving birth or  getting pregnant. “Few girls who have either given birth and are nursing their young ones or are about to give birth have been allowed to remain home for some few days. After that, we will ensure they go back to school,” Magoha said. He said the ministry has data of all the girls who have resumed and those who `have not. Magoha said school heads and education official will follow up on all students to ensure those who got pregnant during the closure of schools  report back. Contrary to reports that most girls at the Coast region are yet to resume school after they got pregnant, Magoha said the region was not exceptional as the problem is countrywide. Magoha further said millions of girls in primary and high school will benefit from free sanitary towels to keep them in school. He said all regions have received the towels and will now embark on distributing them to schools. “1.7 million girls in primary school who are eligible for the sanitary  and their colleagues in high school will receive sanitary package for nine months,” he said. The CS said the ministry in the process of acquiring masks for all students. The masks will be delivered in phases in the counties to ensure  supply of masks at all time. Priority will be given to students in the slum areas. “Masks have not even been made, How can some people claim we have sold them? They being manufactured now and when they are ready, we will notify you,” he said. He said the ministry will install regional banks where needy cases of students needing masks will receive them instantly from the government officials.
