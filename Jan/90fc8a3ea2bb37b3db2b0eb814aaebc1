Residents of Lari have asked the government to increase security to stop a criminal gang that has been terrorising them. Former MP Mburu Kahangara said the gang has been stealing livestock and other valuables from homes. He said in November last year they entered his compound in Githirioni village but were unable to break into his house. They moved to his neighbour's home where they stole a television and other valuables. "We need security improved. We need to be at peace. We urge our people to alert the police whenever they notice anything unusual at night or during the day. Let us help them with any information that will help them improve our security," Kahangara said. Kagwe resident Joan Nyambura said the gang targets dairy cows, which they sell to farmers elsewhere at a throwaway price. Traders have also asked the government to tighten security in areas along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. Subcounty traders welfare chairman Paul Ngugi said traders do not want to invest in insecure places. He said most investors prefer buying land in Nyambare, Uplands, Mathore, Rukuma, Kimende, Gichiengo and Kinale, which are near the highway. "Investments are very expensive, since one has to save and take loans," Ngugi said. Subcounty police commander Stephen Kirui urged residents to keep them informed of any suspicious persons in the area. He said police will increase patrols. "At this age and time, robbers should know that we do not have their time. It is either they do another business, because they risk being arrested," the police boss warned. He spoke at Lari police station.
