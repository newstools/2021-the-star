A team of detectives is investigating if bank staff or imposters were involved in a Tuesday incident in which three suspects escaped death by a whisker moments after they had snatched Sh320,000 from a man who had withdrawn from a bank in Nairobi. The man had walked from the bank with the cash when he was accosted by three people who had parked outside. They then introduced themselves as a mobile phone employee before one of them grabbed the cash. The man then ducked into the waiting car and drove off. The man screamed for help prompting bodaboda operators who witnessed it to chase a Voxy car that the men were using towards Haile Selassie and Uhuru Highway where it was blocked at the University Way roundabout. The bodaboda operators beat up the three suspects and vandalized their car. In the process, the said money went missing. It took the intervention of police officers at the roundabout to shield the three who were later rushed to the Mbagathi Hospital with multiple injuries. The drama of their beatings was captured on camera by other motorists. The getaway vehicle whose windshields had been smashed was towed to the Central Police station. Police believe some staff or imposters usually sit in banking halls and monitor transactions before alerting the gangs. Such incidents have been reported in the past. Nairobi police boss Rashid Yakub confirmed they are investigating the incident. He also discouraged against mob lynching terming it criminal. “Always call the police when you have issues. Mob lynching can be bad on those involved and it is always wrong to lynch suspects,” he said.
