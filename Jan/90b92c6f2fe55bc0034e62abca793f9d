Kenya international striker Festus Onyango is perplexed by his omission from the national squad ahead of the regional African Cup of Nations qualifiers set for March in Nairobi. Kenya men’s team face Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Sudan, Libya and Seychelles in a round robin format show at the Sikh Union Stadium. The Butali Warriors forward was the star performer during the Olympic qualifiers in 2019 in South Africa as he emerged top scorer in the Kenyan team with four goals. He was a regular member of the national team during the reign of Meshack Senge and a former captain of Strathmore Gladiators. Onyango was the Most Valuable Player in the 2019 Kenya Hockey Union league and runner up on the scoring chart with 12 goals. The 24-year-old said the decision had taken him aback but wished the team well in the qualifier. “It is surprising that I was not considered in the provisional team. To be honest, I have no idea why I was left out,” said the 2017 top scorer with 20 goals. Asked whether he thought it was just an error of omission, he said: “I don’t think so. But I have no hard feelings and I want the best for the team.” The deadly forward managed 20 goals in 2018— three shy off  Butali’s George Mutira who registered 23. Effort to reach coach Fidelis Kimanzi to comment on the issue were futile.
