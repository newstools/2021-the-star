Kenya have had their bid to host the next round of FIBA AfroBasket group qualifying matches rejected as Yaounde, Cameroon and Monatsir, Tunisia were chosen to stage the tournament slated for February 17-21. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) assistant secretary Ambrose Kisoi confirmed that the federation had submitted its bid to FIBA. FIBA said the most important criteria for choosing the host was health and travel guarantees, testing and controlled entry to a secure environment. Regardless, Kisoi said KBF is busy preparing the national team, Morans, for a  successful search for a ticket to the 30th edition of the FIBA AfroBasket tournament in Kigali in August 24-September 5. Morans were due to assemble this week to start training for the 20-team tournament. The top three finishers from the five groups will qualify for the finals. They will be hoping for better fortunes against their Group B rivals Senegal and Angola who thrashed them in their previous round of qualifying matches in November. They won one match against Mozambique — the other team in their group. Locally, various teams are assembling their arsenals in readiness for the start of the men and women's league in February. Meanwhile, former national champions Kenya Ports Authority have signed Rita Aluoch from defending champions Equity Bank. Coach Anthony Ojukwu described the signing as a transfer coup, which will enhance KPA's bid to wrestle the title from the bankers. "I am sure having Aluoch at KPA and also signing some young talents is a good move for the team going forward. The team is happy and the morale is very high in the camp. There is no reason for them not to perform," he said. The youngsters signed by the Mombasa-based outfit include Terry Ekisa, Diana Apiyo, Marylissa Atieno, Celia Okumu, Vivian Nafuna, Halima Nzomo, Carolina Akinyi, Yvonne Atieno, Medina Muller and Barbra Diana. The experienced players include Achieng Taudenciah, Rachael Wandago, Hilda Indasi and Brenda Angeshi.
