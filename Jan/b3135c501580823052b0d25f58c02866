Sometimes scientists get it wrong. The plan by the respected Kenya Forest Research Institute to reforest Kenya with bamboo is misguided. Kefri is initially bringing in bamboo seed from India and China to plant a 250-acre trial plot in Kaptagat forest (see P10). There are multiple reasons why this is a bad proposal. Firstly, what is wrong with Kenya indigenous bamboo species? Why does Kefri think a foreign species is better? Secondly, imported foreign plants often become invasive. Look at the problems Kenya has with prosopsis, lantana and prickly pear. Do we want to risk the mass planting of another foreign species, especially one that is water-hungry? Thirdly, a foreign species of bamboo may retain water on the mountainside but it won't increase biodiversity. And biodiversity increases pollination, soil fertility and thereby agricultural productivity. Let Kefri create a second 250-acre demonstration plot and plant it with indigenous trees that grow quickly, provide good timber and stabilise hillsides. Then we can objectively compare the two trial plots and decide if it is worth the risk of planting new foreign plant species all across Kenya, or whether indigenous species can do as well or better.
