A 17-year-old boy is nursing injuries at Kenyatta National Hospital after he was stabbed by another student. The Form 3 student at Wahundura Secondary School in Mathioya, Murang'a, was reportedly stabbed on Sunday. The school administration took him to hospital. His sister, Grace Nyambura, said the injury was inflicted near his eyes. He was taken back to a health facility on Monday. It was then that he called to inform his family that he had been injured. Nyambura told the Star the school admitted that her brother had been injured but maintained that the injuries were minor.Â The family eventually took him to Murang'a Level 5 Hospital where a scan was taken. "The scan indicated that the injury was intrusive and he was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital," she said. Nyambura said the brother was hospitalised after doctors found that he had blood clots in the head. The boy who stabbed him fled immediately after the incident. The two boys had argued over a padlock and that escalated into a fight. "My brother said he lost a padlock and other students said the suspect had stolen it but he denied the claims," Nyambura said. Nyambura added that the suspect allegedly called his brother outside the dormitory where he stabbed him. Mathioya subcounty police commander Pauline Mwangi said the suspect got back into the school on Thursday afternoon after which he was arrested. Investigations are underway. Mwangi said the student informed police officers that he panicked and fled onto a coffee farm after realising the victim's injuries were serious. She said the suspect is being held at Kiria-ini police station and has claimed that a Form 1 student had given him the padlock. He told the officers that the victim started the fight claiming the padlock was his, and he only acted in self-defence. "He claimed to have hit the victim with a spoon but we are still investigating the matter before we charge him with assault," Mwangi said.
