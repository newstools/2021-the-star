The National Land Commission will scale up alternative dispute resolution systems to expedite determination of disagreements on land. NLC vice-chairperson Getrude Nduku said on Friday that there is a massive backlog of cases registered with the commission. Nduku made her remarks during a virtual meeting to sensitise civil society, the media, community and faith-based organisations on the contents of the draft strategic plan 2020-25. Nduku said land disputes have caused loss of lives, money and property. Acting NLC chief executive officer Kabale Tache said the strategic plan has been developed through public participation. She said the plan is also aligned with national development priorities, the Constitution, Vision 2030 among other blueprints. Tache urged community organisations to continue working with the commission to bring the much-needed reforms. The CEO thanked civil society for helping the commission during the school titling process. Under the lapsed 2013-18 strategic plan, the NLC said it acquired land worth Sh38.273 billion for 77 public projects. It saysÂ  15,513 complaints were received out of which 5,773 were investigated or reviewed and 4,088 determined and gazetted. The commission says 693 historical land injustices claims were received, out of which 126 were admitted, investigated and determinations issued. The commission says it resolved various disputes through alternative mechanisms, a cost-effective and quick way. It prepared 1,624 extensions and renewal of leases; approved 3,290 subdivision or amalgamation schemes, 1,925 change or extension of user and 2,566 building plans. "We processed over 60,000 requests; dispatched 3,020 transfers of public school land to relevant registries for registration from an audit of over 10,000 public schools," NLC says. The commission says it received 3,865 letters of allotment, out of which 382 were verified. It says it handled over 4,000 cases that were filed in different courts country wide. On the allocation of public land, it says it processed over 6,000 requests from counties for unalienated public land. NLC says its financial requirements for the planning period are expected to grow marginally over the first three years from Sh3.448 billion to Sh5.132 billion and reduce to Sh3.594 billion by last year. Commission chairman Gershom Otachi said they will focus on development at the county level. Otachi said the commission in the next five years is committed to delivering on five key areas. These include management and administration of public land, security of rights, revenue generation, and strengthening of the commission.
