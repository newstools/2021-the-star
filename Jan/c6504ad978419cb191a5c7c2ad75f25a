Luanda subcounty in Vihiga has registered 300 disabled children but it is believedÂ there are more, Cyprian Ongudu of the social services department has said. He said there was an urgent need for all children living with disability to be registered to get government support. Ongudu said officials from the department will visit homes to register any hidden children so that they can accord them the necessary help and education. He spoke to the press on Friday in his office where he denied claims that his office was not offering services to the community. "What we want is for people to visit our offices so that we can assess the situation and advise on which help these people need," he said. "We have got various challenges. There are those who need hearing aids, eye sight aids and walking aids or those who specifically need financial support," Ongudu told the press. He said many residents had declined to present their children to his office to accord them the necessary help. Ongudu urged property owners to ensure buildings are designed to be friendly to persons living with disability. Edited by Henry Makori
