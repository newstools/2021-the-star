Lovejyot Singh savoured his maiden 4WD Turbo win as the first round of the KCB National Autocross Championship at the Waterfront Karen. The LJ Racing team driver had his campaign effectively sewn up when defending champion Sahib Omar ran into mechanical gremlins. Sahib, who is gunning for back to back titles this year, broke two rear driveshafts to settle for third overall. Rally driver Karan Patel went home with two bonus championship points after setting the Fastest Time of the Day. He wrapped up his day’s 4WDT campaign in second overall position. Lovejyot was all smiles after a dry and dusty day on the track. “When I came home in the morning, I learned of top drivers and felt quite nervous. So I knew I was going to attack all the way to keep up with the pack. The track set up was a lot similar to what we did last year, so I stuck to my lines and mastered the track,” said Lovejyot Girl rider Kiana Rajput won the Pee Wee Class for the kids as her elder brother Yuvraj Rajput settled for the Bambino class. Newcomer Brandon Ng’anga clocked 03.40.18 to beat debutant Neel Gohil (04.42.60). Defending champion Zameer Verjee started off his campaign with victory in 2WD NT Class beating Abdul Razak Rehan and Noor Rehman to the podium dash. Patel was using the event to dust-off a few cobwebs prior to the season-opening KNRC event set for Soysambu on February 20-21. “I’m definitely enjoying myself. It’s been a while since I was in the car- so it’s quite a good feeling. We will be testing our R5 car (Ford Fiesta) well in time for the first rally event. We always do that prior to a rally to ensure that the car is in good working order,” he said.
