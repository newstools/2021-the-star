The High Court has for the second time issued an order suspending a Gazette notice calling for the by-election of the Nairobi Gubernatorial seat. Justice Anthony Mrima on Thursday issued the order following an application filed by Anne Kananu. Two other cases filed by Okiya Omtatah and Habil Kongo respectively (an aspiring Nairobi Governor) are to be heard on Thursday afternoon. They are seeking orders blocking Kananu's vetting slated for Friday among other orders. Justice Mrima had earlier this month suspended the special Gazette notice issued by the IEBC last month calling for a by-election to replace impeached Governor Mike Sonko. The judge ruled the by-election suspended pending the hearing and determination of the application by Sonko, who argued that procedures were violated, hence, the impeachment is null and void. Sonko challenged his removal from office, claiming the due process was violated. He argued he will suffer snots ouster from office. Sonko argued that he will suffer irreparable damage because he stands to lose his position as the second governor of the city without due process of the law. Last week, an anti-corruption court formally withdrew a petition filed by a Nairobi voter - Peter Agoro -challenging the nomination of Kananu as Nairobi's Deputy Governor. Impeached Governor Mike Sonko represented by lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui had opposed the withdrawal of the case and subsequently filed a cross-petition. But Justice Hedwig Ongundi on Thursday said the alleged petition has not been paid for and it is not before her so she cannot make any directions. With the withdrawal of the petition, Kananu could be hastily vetted by the county assembly and sworn in as the deputy governor. She would then take over as the first woman governor of Nairobi. Kananu, a criminology graduate, served as Disaster Management chief officer in Sonko's administration.
