The Vihiga county government has suspended salaries for striking health workers. Services in all public hospitals in the county have remained disrupted since health workers went on strike early last month. Health executive Amos Kutwa said salaries will remain suspended for the period the health workers will be on strike. He warned that further sanctions were being undertaken. “We will not allow our people to die as others undergo physical and psychological torture as they try to seek medical attention. There is no justification for us to carry on with the salary payments when it’s clear the health workers have not worked," Kutwa told journalists in his office. Kutwa said plans were underway to fill the positions of health workers who would not have reported for duty by the time the advert for the positions will be placed. The county government had issued sack threats to workers who would not have reported for duty by the end of last week, but none obeyed. Kenya National Union of Nurses Vihiga branch leaders, led by Zadock Miheso, termed the directive mere sideshows. Kutwa said efforts by the government to seek a return-to-work formula with the health workers have not yielded fruit as their representatives maintain a tough stand. The health workers are demanding a comprehensive health insurance, free treatment for the staff who may contract Covid-19, enhanced health insurance and creation of a national health services commission among other grievances.
