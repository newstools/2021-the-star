President Uhuru Kenyatta may not hit the ground to campaign for the Building Bridges Initiative in his Mt Kenya backyard any time soon, his allies have said. The President’s inner circle feels that it would be too early for the head of the state to popularise a document that is still with the IEBC and is yet to be approved by county assemblies. This is why an advance team of Cabinet secretaries, principal secretaries, and senior government officials has been mandated to market the document in the region. Talks about Deputy President William Ruto impeachment are expected to gain momentum this week, with ANC and ODM planning a meeting on Tuesday. This is the third time Ruto is being asked to resign or face impeachment. Multiple sources said ANC bigwigs will be meeting their ODM counterparts to discuss the impeachment motion. But allies of Ruto have rubbished the plot. Striking health workers have pledged to defy sacking threats by governors and stay away from public hospitals. Speaking in Nairobi on Sunday, clinical officers said counties were being insincere and misrepresenting their demands. Kenyan Union of Clinical Officers secretary-general George Gibore said no county has been asked to allocate resources to pay medics' allowances as they have been alleging. He said they had requested counties to table any contracts they have with health insurers but they had yet to do so. Vehicles and the Indian Ocean have made strange bedfellows the past few years. ‘Bus plunges into Indian Ocean at Likoni ferry crossing in Mombasa.’ ‘Lorry plunges into Indian Ocean at Likoni channel.’ Despite journalists capturing photos and stories of mishaps at the Likoni Ferry crossing channel, little has been done to stop the tragedies from recurring.
