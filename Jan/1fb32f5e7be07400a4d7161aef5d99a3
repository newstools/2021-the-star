Mathare United forward Clifford Alwanga has been ruled out of action indefinitely after he tore ligament and dislocated his kneecap during a training session over the weekend. The forward had just resumed training after taking a short break to attend to private matters and had joined the side to prepare for their next league assignment against Zoo Kericho when the misfortune befell him. He missed out on their opening encounter against Sofapaka at Wundanyi Stadium, Taveta where they went down 4-2 and was not part of the match day squad  when they crashed 1-3 to reigning KPL champions Gor Mahia at MISC, Kasarani. Alwanga will now have to wait a little longer before he can have a taste of the new season. Club doctor Wycliffe Omom confirmed the incident, saying the player had landed awkwardly while vying for the ball with a teammate during a training session. "He landed awkwardly and twisted his knee. We can't assess the extent of the injury for now as the damaged area is still swollen but we are waiting to run tests to know how to deal with the situation," said Omom. Fitness coach Dismas Akwany said he hopes the player would recover in time for their next match. "We are working on his condition and we are optimistic he won't be out for long," said Akwany. Alwanga has managed to net a total of 11 goals for the Slum Boys since joining them in the January 2018 transfer window after being released by Tusker  following an injury-plagued season which pushed him down the pecking order. Alwanga's injury has compounded selection worries for coach Salim Ali as the side continues to grope for their first win after exhibiting a poor run so far. The Slum Boys kicked off the season comparatively late after being caught up in a broadcast rights row with Football Kenya Federation.
