The Housing ministry will partner with Murang'a county to construct over 600 affordable housing units. Governor Mwangi wa Iria said on Thursday the county has identified two parcels of land for the project. One will be on 34 acres in Kabati and another four-acre parcel has been identified in Makenji along the Thika-Kenol highway. More housing units will be put up later in Murang’a town, targeting national and county governments workers. Wa Iria said the project will be commissioned within 90 days. "We hope to have completed the first phase of the project before the end of next year," the governor said. The governor was accompanied by Housing Principal Secretary Charles Hinga on a tour of the sites. The PS said the project will empower Kenyans by giving them home ownership documents that will help them access credit from financial institutions. Hinga encouraged other counties to emulate Murang'a and identify areas where the houses can be put up. The Murang'a project is part of the government's plan to put up 500,000 units in the Affordable Housing pillar of President Uhuru’s Big Four Agenda. The entire project is projected to cost Sh1.2 trillion. Wa Iria also said Kenol and Kangari towns that are densely populated will be redesigned and transformed into municipalities. “We have applied to have the two towns reclassified to complement the housing project,” he said. Currently, only Murang'a town is a municipality and has benefited from huge funding that have transformed the face of the town.
