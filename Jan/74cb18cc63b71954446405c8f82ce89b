Football Kenya Federation president Nick Mwendwa has been given the green-light to seek the position of committee member in the Fifa council after the football governing body’s Review Committee published the names of those eligible for the polls. “We kindly inform you that the review committee has, based on the information available, declared candidates eligible for the respective positions,” read a letter by the committee’s chairman Mukal Mudgal. According to the letter four individuals will be vie for the vice presidency position while 13 will be seeking membership slots in the 37-man strong council. A position for Mwendwa in the council will be of immense benefit to Kenyan football and will also give him a platform to seek the Caf leadership in the future. Suspended Caf president Ahmad Ahmad has been barred from contesting because of a sanction imposed by the Fifa Ethics Committee and violation of the Fifa Code of Conduct. Congolese Constant Omari, who was representing Africa in the council, has also been barred from the polls that will involve Member Associations.
