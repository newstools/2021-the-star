US-based Kenyan gospel singer Kathleen Donna is set to release a new album, 'Jesus Reign over Covid', featuring big acts. Speaking to Word Is, the talented singer said the album has five songs. "God has done a lot of things in my life and regardless of the situation and struggle I saw last year, handling Covid patients in their homes and praying for them, it has not been easy," she said. "My fans, Jesus has walked with me and protected me over Covid as well. This album will be the greatest of all times since I have worked with a lot of my Kenyan studio producers to ensure it has the African feel as well, apart from the collaborations." She released her first single, 'Nampenda Yesu', in 2015. The album will be available on all digital platforms once it is out.
