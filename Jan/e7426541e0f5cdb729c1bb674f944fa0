The President has a duty to unite the country, spur economic development and fulfil the promises he made before the 2017 General Election. He is under an obligation to hand over harmoniously, constitutionally so, to the next choice of the Kenyan people when they go to the ballot in 2022. He also has a duty, because he is a voter, at an appropriate time, to lay a hand on whomever he prefers to be his successor. Kenya is a democratic system where the people exercise their sovereign powers to elect their leaders in a democratic process every five years. Kenyans will elect leaders of their choice in 2022 through a very democratic process. This is very critical. When that time comes, the President will give indications which are not final but persuasive because he would like to leave the country in good hands. The head of state would like, after he completes his constitutional term, to leave behind a united country set for further development. We think Uhuru Kenyatta means well for Kenya as he has been consistent that at an appropriate time he will give indications, which is only right. In my view, he is living up to the expectations of the people because he is striving to unite the country and leave it on the path of development. Anytime soon, he will leave no doubt as to whom he prefers to succeed him. As the ODM party, we want to be categorical that we will present a presidential candidate, definitely, and would like to form the next government. As a party, we have always had a dream of forming government and pursuing our leadership agenda. ODM is the most organised and well-structured party today, with offices across the country. We want to serve Kenyans with the utmost fidelity and spur economic growth. It is our duty. Actually, we are the most prepared party, set and ready to give the country direction from development to good leadership. The writer is the ODM national treasurer and ex-Kitutu Masaba MP
