According to a press statement yesterday, the tickets will be valid for local travel between 11th January and 20th March 2021. The Jambojet Head of Sales and Marketing, Titus Oboogi said throughout 2020, they provided their customers with attractive incentives to encourage them to fly in the new normal. "As we start the new year, we remain committed to providing affordable, safe and reliable experience with the customer at the centre of everything we do,” noted Oboogi. He said the offer applies to Jambojet’s domestic destinations namely Mombasa, Eldoret, Kisumu, Malindi and Ukunda (Diani) and from its hub in Nairobi.
