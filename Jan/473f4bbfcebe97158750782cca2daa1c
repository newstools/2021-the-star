A father from Mwingi Central in Kitui is appealing to well-wishers to help raise Sh1.5 million for his daughter's heart surgery in India. Stephen Muthangya from Mui ward said Ann Muthangya, 12, started falling ill three years ago. Muthangya said his last-born daughter’s grades in school started deteriorating, and she stopped playing with her age mates. He said she would sit down and rest several times when she was walking. Her heart would pound hard and fast – it still does. They took her to a private hospital in Mwingi but her condition did not improve. They were referred to The Mater Hospital in Nairobi where she was treated. On October 19, 2020, her condition worsened and was rushed to Hurlingham Heart Clinic and was diagnosed with severe mitral valve regurgitation— severe pulmonary hypertension and rheumatic heart disease. On January 14, the father of four, took his daughter to Kenyatta National Hospital. The hospital recommended that he take his daughter to India, where the surgery will cost of Sh1.5 million. Muthangya said the surgery is set to take place before the end of March this year, yet he is unable to raise the amount. He said his daughter’s condition has continued to worsen. “Ann no longer attends school as her condition is not good. I'm pleading with well-wishers to come forth and extend a helping hand,” he pleaded. Muthangya, a matatu driver, is the sole breadwinner in his family. His wife stays home to take care of their daughter. “With Covid-19 pandemic, things have not been easy as I also have three other children who are also in school,” Muthangya said To extend a helping hand, one can reach him on 0712213947.
