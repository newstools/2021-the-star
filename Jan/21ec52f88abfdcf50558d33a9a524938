A Kenya Wildlife Service ranger who allegedly threatened to shoot dead his girlfriend will remain in custody after police sought a court order to detain him pending investigations. Francis Macharia, a ranger based in Malindi, was arraigned on Friday before Makadara chief magistrate Angelo Kinthinji  but he did not take a plea after police sought more days  to detain him. Police constable Morgan Mwaura attached to Mwiki police station said he was investigating a case of threatening to kill and causing a disturbance in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace among other offences. Macharia is accused of threatening to shoot dead his girlfriend Rahab Wairimu together with her child. He reportedly went to Wairimu's business and assaulted her together with her customers he accused of dating her. “After intervention by members of the public, the respondent said that he would get a gun and kill her together with her child,” Mwaura said in an affidavit filed at Makadara law courts. He said that the complainant got scared since the suspect is an officer working under KWS and thus can easily access a gun. Mwaura told the court that  Macharia was arrested but released on January 28 but he returned to Wairimu’s business premises and caused chaos again. The officer said Macharia is a threat to Wairimu and sought the court’s permission to hold him for a day. Chief magistrate Angelo Kithinji granted the orders. The matter will be mentioned on February, 1.
