A family in Nairobi is searching for their daughter who disappeared on her way to school in Makueni on January 4. Leah Atieno, a Form 4 candidate at St Stephen ACK Kima in Makueni county, never reported to school after she boarded a matatu at Cabanas stage along Mombasa Road. Speaking to the Star on the phone, her mother Josephine Mwende said her daughter took a matatu at Masimba stage in Kayole, Nairobi on January 4, morning accompanied by her younger brother. They both took a matatu to Cabanas where she parted ways with the brother after she boarded a matatu headed to the school. “My daughter got lost on her way to school. I left the house with her while going to work together with her younger brother.  The brother accompanied her to Cabanas where she reportedly boarded the vehicle,” Mwende said. She said the school’s matron informed her that her daughter had not reported to school last Friday. Mwende said attempts to find her daughter had not borne fruit even after she enquired her whereabouts from the girls’ close friends. “My daughter had a phone when she was at home before the schools reopened. I thought she had left it in the house but I have searched everywhere and not found it,” Mwende said. She said Atieno was last seen on WhatsApp the same morning at around 8am while she was still in the house. Her cellphone line has since been switched off. Mwende said the girl had been chatting with some of her school friends that morning before she left for school. She is now calling on anyone who has come across the girl to report to the nearest police station. The matter was reported to Soweto police station in Nairobi via OB NO 16/16/1/2021 at 1025 hours.
