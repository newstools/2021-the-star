The national government will partner with the county government of Isiolo to establish four police stations along the border with Garissa and Wajir to beef up security in the conflict-prone region. Isiolo Governor Mohamed Kuti said plans have been finalised between the relevant sectors to have permanent police stations at strategic border points to instil confidence among residents and ensure timely response in case of security threats. He said the county government will set aside funds to facilitate the construction of the police stations in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior. The announcement comes barely a week after an attack at Urura along the border of Isiolo and Wajir counties where six people from Isiolo were brutally killed and a woman left nursing gunshot wounds. Planned killings of livestock herders, raids on rural settlements, brutal murders of herdsmen and indiscriminate killings of pastoralists from Isiolo county have continued unabated by suspected residents of neighbouring counties following border disputes. Kuti hailed Interior CS Fred Matiang'i for taking swift action to end boundary wrangles by ordering the two regional commissioners to mark the administrative boundaries of each county in the next two weeks. The governor assured that those displaced will be resettled in their homes to ensure they go about their work undisturbed. Calling on the communities to embrace peace, Kuti assured that chiefs and their assistants from Garrisa county now working in Isiolo that they will be redeployed back to Garrisa for Isiolo to set new administrative units.
