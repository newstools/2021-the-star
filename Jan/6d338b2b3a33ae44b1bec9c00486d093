Hoteliers are complaining that the Covid-19 safety protocols put in place by the Ministry of Tourism are too costly compared to their returns. They now want the government to help provide basic items like face masks and sanitisers as a way of supporting the  hotel industry struggling to get back on its feet. In an interview,  Domestic Tourism Association chairman Tuqa Jirmo said industry players have exhausted their little resources and can no longer afford to source Covid-19 prevention materials. ''Most of our members have been spending more than they are earning to comply with the protocol. They are now contemplating total closure. We urge the government to step in and save the situation,'' Tuqa pleaded. In July, Kenya announced a raft of protection measures for the reopening of  restaurants These included regular sanitisation of rooms, furniture and beddings, supply of protective gear, screening of employees and visitors  and regular Covid-19 tests for staff. Implementation of those safety measures saw  Kenya become the first country to be awarded ‘Safer Tourism Resilience Seal’ in August. ''We acknowledge the importance of observing health and safety measures. However, the cost has become too much to bear,'' Tuqa said. The association now wants the government to turn the Sh6 billion stimulus package into seed money and relax conditions around it. The official said the stringent conditions in place to access the loan has sidelined small operators in the sector. Tuqa said most hoteliers are reluctant to go for the credit facility. Early this month, the Tourism Finance Corporation said despite the government allocating the lion’s share of the Sh3 billion tourism stimulus package meant to the Coast region, only a handful had applied. The amount is part of the Sh53.7 billion shillings economic stimulus package was announced by the president to cushion citizens from the financial stress occasioned by the pandemic.
