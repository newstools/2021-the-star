National Under-21 coach Michael Malungu faces selection headache owing to a large pool of talent at his disposal ahead of Africa Junior Cup. The Africa show is scheduled for March in Accra, Ghana. The Western Jaguars tactician admitted that the current pool of over 40 players are all fighting to make the final cut of 18 players hence making the process even tougher. However, Malungu welcomed the competition for places as the technical bench prepares to make crucial calls. Players, who represented the country in the Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Argentina in 2018 andÂ  the five-a-side tournament in 2019, start favourites. However, Malungu said they will not lock out any player who will convince the selectors during training. He also pointed out that young players who trained with the national team in 2019 for the Olympic qualifiers are in contention. "It is going to be a very competitive and intense exercise because of the large pool and quality players we have at the moment. We will be fair and honest as we assess all the upcoming players. We've had training and interaction with close to 40 players and we are closely following their growth," he observed. He added: "Kenya team to the Olympic qualifiers two years ago had Ben Wakhungu and Ivan Ludiali who are U-21 players. There was also Robinson Omutekete, Richard Njuki, Samwel Silong and Paul Navangi who had a chance to train with the senior team. We will, therefore make decisions soon." Malungu revealed that his immediate task is to ensure the players are in the best physical condition as they contend with the three days a week training program. "Our priority is the physical conditioning of the players because you can't build a team that is not fit. We are also working on the technical basic skills and I expect players to be sharp," he quipped.
