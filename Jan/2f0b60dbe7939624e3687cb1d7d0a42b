There was no social distancing at Pirates beach in Mombasa on New Year’s day as merry makers took a dip to celebrate the first day of 2021. This, despite warnings by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe that there is likely to be a surge in Covid-19 cases in January. Kenya recorded 11 new Covid-19 cases on the first day of the new year. Another 156 people have tested positive for the virus out of a sample of 4,317. This brings the total cases to 96,614. Meanwhile, Likoni residents on Friday started using the Liwatoni pedestrian floating bridge after days of trials. Most residents expressed their happiness, saying the bridge, which cost Sh1.9 billion, has made things easier for them. They however lamented the lack of a shed. “Now our children will get to school earlier and we will also get to our workplaces in time without having to wake up at least an hour earlier than we are supposed to,” Mwachiponi Omar, a Mtongwe resident, said. Mwachiponi said he used eight minutes to cross from the Likoni mainland to Mombasa Island. “At the Likoni ferry, I would have taken even two hours,” he said. Reuben Mutua, a hawker who lives about 50 metres from where the bridge ends on the Likoni mainland, said he used less than seven minutes to get to Mombasa Island. Usually, he would take at least 45 minutes using the ferry at the Likoni crossing channel. Mutua differed with residents who called for the construction of a shed on the bridge, saying it may not be practical. “We have used the Nyali bridge for over 30 years and it has never had a shed. I don’t know why people are asking for a shed for this one,” Mutua said. However, the Nyali bridge is half the length of the Liwatoni pedestrian floating bridge. The Nyali bridge is about 440 metres long while the Liwatoni floating bridge is about 840 metres long. The floating bridge is about six metres wide. There is a barrier at the centre to separate those moving in opposite directions.
