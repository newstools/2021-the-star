National Super League side debutants Silibwet Leons have sacked their coach over alleged poor performance. Silibwet Leon’s management said a vote of no confidence was unanimously passed against Patrick Amwoka after the team’s poor show against Nairobi-based Talanta FC. Team manager Erick Rono said while players have always played their role perfectly, some decisions by the coach play to their disadvantage," he added. He accused the coach of turning a deaf ear on the suggestions by the technical bench on how to improve performance of the team. The team is currently seventh on the log with 11 points. Amwoka, who joined the team from Division One side, Zoo Youth will now be replaced by former Nairobi Stima coach Evans Mavuta.  Mavuta will be in charge of the team when they take league leaders Fortune Sacco in Kerugoya on Saturday. Meanwhile, Coast Stima coach Hussein Mohammed is up in arms over the level of officiating in the NSL. He said some referees are pursuing self-interests at the expense of fair play. He cited their match against Bomet APs on Monday,  where his team lost 3-0, at Bomet accusing the centre referee of allegedly favouring the home team.
