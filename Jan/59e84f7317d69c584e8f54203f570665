A group of youths attempted to interrupt ODM leader Raila Odinga’s visit to Kenol yesterday. While some threw stones at his convoy, others engaged in running battles with the police hours after Kiambu politicians, including Jubilee nominated MP Isaac Mwaura, were spotted in the area addressing their supporters. This political thuggery should be stopped before it starts spreading across the country. Since the return of multiparty politics, the country has repeatedly witnessed ethnic tension and violence around election time. Only the 2002 and 2013 polls stand out as being relatively peaceful. Many people died in the 2017 repeat elections, especially in Nyanza following a boycott by Raila’s supporters. In the last few months, this vicious ethnic-driven political intolerance has mostly been fought on social media, which is dominated by young people. If the police do not act fast, the flame that has been fanned on social media may grow into a fire as politicians hit the campaign trail. And with majority of young people idling around the country due to lack of gainful employment, this group is vulnerable to being recruited as perpetrators of violence as it happened yesterday. The police should go for the politicians who mobilised and funded yesterday's chaos.
