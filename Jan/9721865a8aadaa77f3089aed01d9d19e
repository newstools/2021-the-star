A businessman was on Monday charged with forging a Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry certificate. Kevin Macharia was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua where he denied the charges. The charge sheet says he forged certificate number  S.NO.8887 and issued it to Melizer Company Limited and dated on June 16, 2020. The accused person was also charged with making a false document with intent to defraud. Macharia was charged that on June 18, 2020 at unknown place within Kenya, he forged the signature of Ivan Obare a staff at Kephis. Macharia was also charged with obtaining  Sh11,229,000 from Russian Savriddinov Nazar, the director of Best Foods Company Limited, by falsely pretending that he was in a position to  sell him and facilitate  the shipping of  five 40-feet containers of dried macadamia nuts to Qingdao, China. He is said to have committed the offence on diverse dates between May 21 ,2020 and July 13, 2020 at unknown place within Kenya. The accused person however through his lawyer denied the charges and pleaded for lenient bond terms. He told court that he was a family man and his children were schooling hence the need for him to be released on bond. The prosecution however objected his release on bond on the ground that he was a flight risk. The magistrate directed that he be detained at the Capitol Hill police station and be brought back to court on January 6 for bail ruling. Edited by Henry Makori
