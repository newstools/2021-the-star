 Most societies punish or banish an individual who has committed murder. However, with time the issue of mental status came into play. Nowadays, there are rules and laws societies use to punish every one who breaks the law. These laws include penal codes and crimes against humanity laws among others. In murder cases, the court has to satisfy itself on whether an accused person is of sound mind for him or her to stand trial. This is important as it helps the accused persons to be in a position to understand the gravity of the offence he or she is facing. To ascertain the mental status, the courts normally order that an accused person is taken to a mental facility and a test conducted. If the medical report shows that one is sound mentally, he or she can be held accountable for the actions. Also, the court would not want to punish someone who does not appreciate the nature of what they have done. When the court finds that an accused person is not fit to stand trial, the person is sent to a mental facility for treatment. After treatment, the mental facility is expected to make a report to the court on whether the person has recovered or not. Subsequently, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will then decide whether to withdraw the case or proceed with it. In the instance where the ODPP withdraws the case, then the person is released to the family but monitored because he is a risk to society. And when the ODPP continues with the case the court will find, the person guilty but insane. This means that the person will be held in custody but at the pleasure of the President.
