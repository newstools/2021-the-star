Shabana’s interim coach Joseph Ongoro is seeking to be confirmed in the position. Ongoro says if the club continues to record positive results in the National Super League, the management should give him a chance to steer the club to the Kenya Premier League. The former Kisumu All Stars, Muhoroni Youth, Kitengela Shooters and Agro Chemical assistant coach says he is ripe to take charge of the team. Ongoro is KNVB-trained and a certified goalkeeping coach-cum-instructor. “I’m hardworking and patient but as always God’s time is the best,” said the tactician. Shabana beat hosts Mwatate FC 2-1  away at Dawson Mwanyumba Stadium in Wundanyi in Ongoro’s first match in charge on Sunday. “I thank God for giving us our first win of the season… We look forward to many more. I gave some players an opportunity and they did not disappoint,” he noted. Speaking at Gusii Stadium ahead of today’s game against log leaders Coast Stima, Ongoro said his team is ready for the game. “Coast Stima are favourites because they are unbeaten so far and top of the log. But we are going for maximum points so that we improve our position on the log,” said Ongoro, who replaced Vincent Nyaberi. He appealed to the club’s management and fans to continue supporting the team. “For the players and technical bench to deliver, they should be motivated and I want to appeal for support,” said Ongoro. Shabana are placed 13th on the  log with four points from a win and two draws. The club has lost two matches against Kisumu All Stars and Chemelil Sugar.
