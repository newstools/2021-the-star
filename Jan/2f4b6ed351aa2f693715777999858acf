A tout left a court in stitches on Tuesday when he confessed to smoking bhang, adding it makes him understand the Building Bridges Initiative. Wycliffe Orinda, who was charged with creating a disturbance by visiting his wife's workplace and causing chaos, said he felt he was on a journey to Canaan. The BBI report was birthed after the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga after contested General Elections. Raila has previously said the BBI report is the bridge to taking the country to 'Canaan'. Meanwhile, Orinda pleaded guilty before Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku. Orinda allegedly committed the offence on Monday at Revlon Plaza in Nairobi. He also admitted to drinking alcohol, which he said makes him find older women attractive. "I admit that I created a disturbance at Caroline Wambui's place of work and if it was not for drinking Blue Ice alcohol, I could not have met my wife who is older than me," he told court. Orinda said Wambui is his wife and they have children together and that he only wants to see his children when he goes to her workplace. He told Mutuku that he was living with Caroline and the children in Eastleigh but was arrested and taken to Industrial Area after he lost his job. He told the court that by smoking, he is able to understand BBI and feels he is in a journey towards Canaan. The court remanded Orinda until January 28 for his probation report.
