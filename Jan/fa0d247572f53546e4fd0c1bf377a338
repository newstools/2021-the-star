Nominated Senator Beatrice Kwamboka wants Kenya Airways' license to be suspended for shifting her from Business to Economy class. Kwamboka has moved to court in a bid to stop Kenya Airways from operating in Kenya. Through Lawyer Danstan Omari, Kwamboka says she booked a flight to Mombasa for the December holidays on December 6. The tickets were for the legislator and two of her children. "Regrettably, on December 28 at the time of departure, I was shocked to learn that my ticket had been improperly 'sold' to another KQ client without offering me an alternative," reads court documents. Kwamboka claims that her children were forced to travel alone without her as she was left stranded at JKIA for hours before she could find an alternative means to get to Mombasa. She has challenged the decision by KQ to shift her from Business class to Economy class without basis when she had long reserved and paid for her ticket. "Pending hearing of the petition the court be pleased to issue conservatory orders suspending Kenya Airways license to fly and operate in Kenya," reads court papers.
