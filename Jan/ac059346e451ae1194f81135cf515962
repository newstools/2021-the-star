Education CS George Magoha has blamed parents over the increased student attacks on teachers terming them as 'negligent'. Magoha further called law enforcement agencies to take stern action to be taken on the perpetrators of identified cases as he asked teachers to take care of themselves. "The problem is that parents are not giving their children tough love... because for nine months a child has been at home and you've been treating him like an egg and you expect the Principal to instil in him discipline, what do you think will happen?" Magoha said. The CS spoke on Wednesday at Our Lady of Fatima Secondary School in Kariobangi, Nairobi County. Magoha weighed in on the issue following a string of attacks on teachers with the most severe being in Kisii county where a student last week attacked two teachers with a knife injuring one severely. In the meeting, the CS also said that 99 per cent of learners had reported back to schools since the reopening. Magoha also announced that the government is in plans to restart the provision of sanitary to school girls with attention focussed on adolescents in primary schools. "Every girl who is in primary school and is in puberty will receive sanitary towels to last nine months... we are also in talks with KCB Foundation for the same provision to secondary schools," he said. The CS also said the provision of free lunch to learners in arid, semi-arid and informal settlements is to restart as well.
