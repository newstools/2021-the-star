A group of farmers in Tana River has decried perennial floods that have repeatedly destroyed their farms and ruined their livelihood. The spillovers of dams upstream have been blamed for the problem, with farmers now appealing to Kenya Electricity Generating Company for compensation. They say their livelihood is destroyed every time there is overflow. Mohamed Hussein, one the beneficiaries of Oxfam-funded pilot project to help jumpstart farming after the desert locust invasion and destruction due to floods, said the project cannot start because their farms are inaccessible. “Our backbone as farmers is vegetables that have now been destroyed completely by the floods that have been continuous for some time now,” said Hussein, who is the chairman of Abafodho Group of Farmers. The situation was worsened by swarms of desert locusts late last year and early this year. Some 25 farms were each given Sh38,400 in recovery projects implemented by Arid Lands Development Focus (Aldef). Fatuma Ibrahim said the recent floods have washed away machines and destroyed canals that feed more than 200 farms along the river. “We asked the government to help us in solving the recurring floods because we can no longer feed our families; the farms have been destroyed,” she said. Despite interventions by Aldef, the farmers have no capacity to reconstruct their lives following the devastations caused by the calamities. They say they have also lost hundreds of mango and orange trees to floods as the river eats into their farms. “We have been given seeds by Aldef but we can’t access the farms because they are flooded. We appeal to the government to help us,” Abdi Hussein said. They said despite numerous pleas, they haven’t got any assistance from the government or local leaders.
