 The entry of of former Minister Mukhisa Kituyi into the 2022 presidential race will not affect Musalia Mudavadi's chances of clinching the presidency. Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi says Mudavadi remains Mulembe nation's foremost contender for the presidency in 2022 despite other leaders having expressed interest in succeeding President Uhuru Kenyatta. Kituyi had declared his interest to vie for the top seat in next year's general election. He is the secretary general of the United Nation's Conference on Trade and Development. At a meeting with professionals in Bungoma, the former Trade Minister said the country was experiencing a leadership vacuum. He said he was the best to take over from Uhuru and that his journey to State House was unstoppable. Bungoma elders have previously urged President Kenyatta, Mudavadi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula to back Mukhisa for the top seat. Saisi however says Mudavadi remains the spokesperson of the Mulembe nation having been anointed in 2016 based on his political experience. “Which political experience does Kituyi have?” Saisi posed. He said the former Kimilili MP does not have the required political base to run for president. Mudavadi joined politics in 1989 when he took over from his father as MP for Sabatia. He served in various ministries under former presidents Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki. He also served as a deputy prime minister during the Grand Coalition government between 2008 and 2013. “Kituyi should not be talking about the top seat at the moment. He should be looking for political experience instead. I don't think he is able to win even a Senate seat,” Saisi said. He asked Mudavadi's handlers to stop marketing him as an ANC man because that was blocking other people from supporting him. “We are in a multi-party democracy here in western so when you market him under the ANC tag, then it means non-ANC members should not engage in this matter in any way.”
