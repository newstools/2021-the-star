Kenyans will from Monday be able to access public libraries in the country after a long time of closure due to Covid-19. The Kenya National Library Service has announced that all the 64 branches countrywide will be reopened on Monday and are set to resume normal operations. “Library customers are encouraged to follow the Covid-19 protocols provided for safe use of the facilities and resources,” the management said in a notice. The operating hours will remain between 8.00 am to 6.30 pm from Monday to Friday and 8.30 am to 5.00 pm on Saturdays. The libraries will, however, remain closed on Sundays and public holidays. “KNLS head office has relocated to Maktaba Kuu building at Community from KNLS Buruburu library premises. However, the library at Buruburu remains operational,” the management said. The new ultra-modern Maktaba Kuu building which houses KNLS headquarters was officially opened by President Uhuru Kenyatta in November last year. The President pointed out that Maktaba Kuu, which is the first multi-purpose library in Kenya, is part of his Administration’s promise to open new avenues for Kenyans to learn, obtain information, expand their intellectual horizons and promote a reading culture. “This marks an important milestone for us and for the future generations, who stand to benefit from our continued commitment to knowledge and information sharing," Uhuru said. Special features of the library building include a 300 capacity children theatre, a 50-capacity senior citizens section, and four auditoriums with a combined capacity of 1,200 people tailored to provide spaces for local authors and artists to showcase their work. It also has a 500-seater gallery dubbed Sanaa Centre which is available to local artists to showcase their artefacts. The new library building also has a section for persons with disabilities where books and other materials are available in different formats including Braille, audiobooks, and large print formats.
