Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has said ANC party leader is not just a leader of the Luhya community but the country. Speaking during a requiem for Mudavadi's mother at Friends International Centre Ngong road on Thursday, Malala criticized the title of Mulembe leader given to Mudavadi by former speakers at the service. "If you want to propel Musalia to the presidency of this republic, it is a mistake to start giving him some titles equivalent to a chief," Malala said. The funeral service was attended by various politicians including Deputy President William Ruto. Some of the Luhya leaders urged Mudavadi to spearhead reconciliation of the community leaders. Others including Lugari Mp Ayub Savula promised to see him through his dream of becoming Kenya's president. However, Malala termed it hypocritical given most of the leaders are in other political parties. "Luhya leaders, let us stop the old song of uniting the community if you are not in ANC. You cannot support Musalia if you are in Jubilee or ODM, let us be honest," Malala said, leaving mourners in stitches. "If you want to support Musalia Mudavadi genuinely, join ANC and I'm sure we will propel this leader to greater heights. More to follow...
