Ten cases challenging the vetting, appointment, swearing-in and assumption of office of Anne Kananu as governor of Nairobi will now be heard together. High Court judge Anthony Mrima consolidated the cases to save judicial time and accord each party an opportunity to be heard. “In order to foster an orderly conduct of all these related matters and given the limited judicial time, coupled with the need to accord each party an opportunity to be heard, I am of the position that all these matters be consolidated,” he said. Petitioners in the cases include Okiya Omtatah, the Law Society of Kenya, Thirdway Alliance and Anne Kananu. It is in the LSK matter that an order was issued stopping the swearing-in of Kananu as substantive governor. Judge Mrima also directed that the matter be heard by a bench to be constituted by acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu. Kananu has since filed an application seeking to set aside those orders. The application is pending hearing and determination, but the judge has since suspended his order sending the matter to the Acting CJ. The court will issue further directions on February 9. The office of Nairobi Governor became vacant after Mike Sonko was impeached. Nairobi assembly speaker Benson Mutura was appointed acting governor until Kananu stepped in.
