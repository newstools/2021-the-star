President Uhuru Kenyatta went away from the norm and ushered in New Year celebrations at his new home in Transmara West subcounty, Narok County. It has been the tradition for presidents to spend the New Year at State House, Mombasa while addressing the nation. However, during the Thursday address by the head of state, the background was the world-famous Maasai Mara Game Reserve. A source said Uhuru arrived at his new home three days to the New Year. Before ushering New Year, the head of state had attended a private function. The function was attended by Narok governor Samuel Tunai, MCAs Kuyo ole Kijabe (Kimintet) and Michael Seme (Lolgorian). Narok senator Ledama ole Kina on his Twitter handle thanked the president for choosing to stay in Narok County over the holiday. “Welcome to Narok county Mr. President and thank you for choosing Narok county as a place to celebrate the new year and also to retire! Sasa badilisha hiyo kura yako iwe ya Narok (Now change your voters card to Narok).Thank you for adding another district to Narok county-Lolgorian District,” said Ledama. Uhuru urged Kenyans to build back better in 2021 following the harsh effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Uhuru love for the Maasai community is traced back to when his great grandfather, Magana married a Maasai woman named Susana Musana. After renaming her Wanjiru, the two had a child named Muigai who grew up to father Kenya’s first President Kamau wa Ngengi (to be later called Jomo Kenyatta), his first born brother Kung’u Muigai and the last born, James Ngengi. Kamau wa Ngengi (Jomo Kenyatta) was born Southwest of Mt Kenya. It was during the First World War that his grandmother Musana, advised him to go and hide in Narok so avoid being recruited into the British army like his elder brother Kung’u who never came back from battle.
