Fifa has launched Fifa Sound, a new entertainment strategy designed to create innovative and meaningful connections between football fans, music enthusiasts, players, artistes, and the game and songs they all love. Jean-François Pathy, Fifa’s director of marketing, said its vision is to make football truly global, accessible and inclusive. "The crossover between football and music underscores this wider cultural relevance. Both are universal languages and have the power to create unrivalled emotions. It’s a natural fit to bring them together." Fifa Sound is beginning with the launch of an eight-episode podcast series. Hosted by Universal Music Group’s global chart-topping artiste Liam Payne and co-hosted by sports broadcaster Jaydee Dyer, the Fifa PlayOn Podcast pairs star football players with award-winning musicians for unforgettable conversations. In each episode, celebrated footballers from around the world will discuss transformative moments from their careers – on and off the pitch – through the songs that have provided a soundtrack to their lives. The players will be joined by an award-winning musician who inspired them as they explore the interplay between music and football in their lives. Olivier Robert-Murphy, the executive vice president of Universal Music Group for brands, said the podcast will bring together two of the world’s biggest and most influential passion points – football and music – to create a series of unique fan experiences. "Starting with the launch of the PlayOn Podcast series, these initiatives will showcase the symbiosis and shared bonds between the world’s best footballers and musicians alongside the fans that idolise them globally."
