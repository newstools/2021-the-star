Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has defended Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka against claims he grabbed NYS government land in Yatta, Machakos county. Deputy President William Ruto claimed Kalonzo grabbed the public utility. Speaking in her office on Tuesday, Ngilu defended Kalonzo saying the claims were empty talk. Last weekend, the DP while addressing a rally in Kericho said Kalonzo’s development record was the grabbing of a government institution land where he had put up his home. Ngilu termed the allegations as pure lies meant to tarnish the spotless reputation of  Kalonzo. “We know his intention is to stain Kalonzo’s name while we know the real land thief in Kenya. There is no dispute that that person is obviously not Kalonzo Musyoka,” Ngilu said at the Kitui Youth Skills Enterprise Centre at Manyenyoni, within Kitui town. She revealed that during her tenure at Ardhi House being the Lands Cabinet Secreteray, she thwarted an attempt by Ruto to irregularly acquire land belonging to Lang'ata Primary School playground. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta was consulted in forestalling the move. “Kalonzo is a transparent, honest and morally upright leader,” Ngilu said. She disclosed that she was privy to the process that saw Kalonzo own the former NYS land in a legal and procedural manner. “I personally interrogated documents attached to Kalonzo's land, they are legal and so was the process he used to acquire the land. Ruto must stop peddling lies against Kalonzo,” Ngilu said. She asked the DP to concentrate on initiating youth empowerment programmes instead of pushing baseless insinuations meant to divide the country. “It is wrong that the DP gives handouts to the youth. He should be thinking of youth skills development. Ruto should grow the youth instead of brewing trouble for the same youth he claims to help,” the governor said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
