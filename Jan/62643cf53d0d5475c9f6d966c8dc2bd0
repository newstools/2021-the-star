Social distancing will remain a mirage in Mwingi schools as learning resumes, Mwingi Central MP Gideon Mulyungi has said. Mulyungi said congestion was a problem even before the Covid -19 crisis. He expressed concern that no additional classes and desks have been issued in Mwingi. Schools reopen on Monday after they were closed in March. Only Grade 4, Standard 8 and Form 4 learners had resumed learning in October. They will, however, grapple with inadequate facilities that make it difficult to comply with the guidelines meant to control the spread of the virus. Mulyungi said parents have no money and pleaded with the Education ministry to enforce its promise that no child will be sent home because of fee arrears. “The economy has hit everyone very hard, so the government should ensure learners are not sent home for school fees,” he said. He also urged the government to enforce coronavirus safety guidelines, including social distancing, which, according to him, will not be possible in most Kitui schools. “Unless students learn in shifts or under trees, there will be no social distancing in most Kitui schools as learners are many in most public schools,” Mulyungi said. He said the ministry should improvise methods to ensure all WHO safety measures are met. “In Kitui, there is currently no rains so learners might read under trees and just improvise a blackboard, as it is better than risking in the crowded classrooms." The ministry should issue teachers with clear guidelines on how learning should resume, the legislator said.
