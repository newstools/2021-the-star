Mwingi Primary School headteacher Joseph Muthui said on Monday the school needs 28 more classrooms to achieve proper social distancing. Speaking as school reopened, he said it has 16 classrooms, each with a capacity of 75 students â€” far too crowded. "When Grade 4 and Class 8 pupils were in school for their second term, they had occupied all the classrooms where each class had a capacity of 15 pupils," Muthui said. He said the school is receiving a good number of new pupils as some private schools have closed during the nine-month break due to the Covid-19 pandemic. "We already have overwhelming numbers and more are still coming for new admissions," Muthui added. He urged the government to step in and help the institution attain all the required safety guidelines set by WHO. Three-quarters of the pupils reported back to school and Muthui said he hoped he remainder would return during the week. (Edited by V. Graham)
