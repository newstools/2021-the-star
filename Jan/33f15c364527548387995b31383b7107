Former Kenya Cup champions Mean Machine have set their sights on return to the top tier ahead of a playoff tie against rivals Egerton University on February 6. The varsity resumed training last week after the sport was given the green-light to resume training by the Ministry of Sport. Team manager, Wilfred Oyosi said the target is to take one game at a time. "We been away for almost year but the boys are excited and ready for the clash in two weeks time,” added Oyosi. The team is training in batches of 10 players each between Monday and Thursday in accordance with Covid-19 protocols. This will be the second meeting for both sides with Machine have edged out Egerton 18-15 a year ago in Njoro hence the coach expects a close contest. "It's a derby game and both teams will give it their all. We must be well prepared for the clash after being out for nine months with no activity,” observed Oyosi A win over Egerton Wasps will set up a semi-final duel against Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology in Kakamega with the winner set to qualify for the Kenya Cup starting at the end of next month. Strathmore Leos await the winner of the other playoff pitting United States International University (USIU) and Northern Suburbs on the same day. Thirty players have so far resumed training and Oyosi expects stiff competition for places ahead of the encounter. Machine have lost the services of star  back rower Aron Adhanja, who joined Enterprise Cup champions Kabras. "Yes Aron joined Kabras but we are developing new players in some positions,” added Oyosi.
