On Tuesday Interior CS Fred Matiang'i announced that there was going to be an "aggressive" disarmament campaign in Wajir, Garissa and Isiolo. Northern Kenya is plagued by banditry, cattle raiding and inter-clan attacks. The government is right to decide that enough is enough. However it will not be easy. One estimate reckons there are 740,000 illegal guns in Kenya. The army and the police could find themselves outgunned. However there are successful precedents. In Uganda, there were on-off attempts to disarm the Karimjong throughout the 1990s, mainly by buying back guns from cattle keepers. However lawlessness continued and Karimoja remained a no-go zone. In 2006 government launched a full-scale crackdown to collect all guns in Karimoja, locking kraals at night and taking other drastic measures. Today, finally, Karimoja is completely peaceful. It is possible that northern Kenya will also be completely peaceful in 10 years time. However government must be fair in this exercise. All clans and communities must be disarmed, not just a few, including the Pokot and Turkana. And afterwards the KDF must patrol the borders to lock out marauding pastoralists from neighbouring countries.
