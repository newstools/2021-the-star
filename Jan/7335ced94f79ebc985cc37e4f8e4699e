Kisii Governor James Ongwae has praised the UK for funding construction of a Sh1.5 billion anti-Covid-19-compliant market at Daraja Mbili and other projects. Ongwae said his administration will not wish away the gesture as the market will help in reducing congestion in the central business district and curb the spread of Covid. “I'm grateful to the British government for its support in starting the noble project, which is not only aimed at reducing congestion but also curbing the pandemic,” he told the Star on the phone. Kisii town, which is one of the highly congested towns, was elevated to a municipality in 2018 through a Gazette Notice Number 1236 of November 30. The pilot market which will be built under Britain’s Sustainable Urban Economic Development (SUED) programme and will support the county economy through trade and taxes. Ongwae said his administration has the interest of traders at heart, hence focussed on championing an enabling business environment. “I want to see all traders conduct their business in a friendly environment. They need to make good profits because they pay tax,” he said. During the groundbreaking ceremony, SUED team leader Duncan Onyango said the market will accommodate 2,250 traders. He said the works will be in three phases, with the first phase projected to cost between Sh20 million and Sh30 million. He said similar projects will be implemented in other areas. “The market is expected to be complete within 60 days to enable traders to move there to conduct their businesses,” he said. The market will also decongest the Daraja Mbili market, which is the second largest in the Western region after Kibuye in Kisumu. Ongwae urged the contractor to complete the project within the stipulated period.
