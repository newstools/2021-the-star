Police are still looking for one of the missing official cars belonging to Supreme Court judge justice Njoki Ndungu. A driver attached to the judge was Friday night attacked and robbed of the car in Githurai Mwihoko area, Nairobi. Justice Ndungu was not on board at the time of the incident. The driver identified as Stephen Thuku was not injured in the drama. He had apparently dropped the judge at her home several kilometres away and was alone at the time of the incident. He told police he was driving the Toyota Landcruiser Prado at about 7.30 pm when he was blocked by another car whose registration numbers he did not take. Three gunmen who had pistols jumped into the four-wheel-drive car belonging to the judge and bundled the driver to the back seat. The driver said the gunmen took control of the car and drove around the city including up to Kayole before they abandoned him in Kibiku area, Ngong. He said he lost Sh110,000 to the gang. The gang also took with them two sets of number plates that were in the car. Police believe the gang was interested in the car. A search for it is ongoing, police said Sunday. Police said the car had registration number KCN 117M on it at the time of the incident. The spare numbers that were inside are KBX 495M and GKB 020V. Police have asked the public who may spot it to report to them.
