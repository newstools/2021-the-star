Polling stations have opened across Uganda for presidential and parliamentary elections, amid increasing tension and an internet shutdown. Journalists in Uganda have been posting pictures and videos of queues at polling stations in the capital, Kampala, and across the country. Polls opened at 07:00 local time and are scheduled to close at 16:00, although the election commission saidÂ all registered voters who will be in the queue by closing time will be allowed to cast their ballots. Opposition presidential candidate Bobi Wine is expected to cast his vote at a polling station on the outskirts of Kampala. President Yoweri Museveni will vote in his rural home in Western Uganda.

Those who tweeted from various polling stations said materials were yet to be delivered by 07:00 local time when polls were supposed to open. The government has ordered a block on all social media. Here are some tweets from journalists on the Thursday delay:
