Mwingi MP West MP Charles Nguna has defended his party boss Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka over allegations that he grabbed public land in Yatta. The accusation was made by Deputy President William Ruto in Bomet on Friday. He claimed Kalonzo grabbed a 200-acre government land in Yatta which belonged to the NYS. But Kalonzo dismissed the claims as wild and constituted character assassination. Nguna said his party leader is the most corruption-free politician in Kenya. Speaking in Kiomo in Mwingi West, the MP said the DP should shun such allegations and continue with his 2022 presidential bid without dragging Kalonzo along. “The Wiper party leader has never been mentioned in any graft case and so Ruto should keep off dragging his name in graft allegations as they hold no water,” Nguna said. Kalonzo asked the authorities to investigate the matter. He challenged Ruto to present himself for investigation concerning nine allegations he read out during a press conference in Nairobi on Monday. Kalonzo’s utterances have caused mixed reactions as politicians allied to the Deputy President rushed to defend Ruto while those allied to Musyoka defended the Ukambani political kingpin. Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu defended Musyoka, stating the attack on him was ill-advised. Speaking at Manyenyoni in Kitui, she said the allegations were false.
