Detectives in Kisii on Monday arrested a primary school pupil and her secondary school boyfriend for an alleged plot to poison a parent for objecting to their affair. The boy is a Form 4 candidate. Villagers said the two had been infatuated with each other for months, infuriating the girl's father who sought to terminate the relationship. However, the girl would have none of it. She allegedly woke up on Sunday morning, cooked porridge and laced it with poison, intending to serve it to her father. She was however caught in the act. The girl and boy have since booked at Kegati police station. Kisii County Police Commander Jebel Munene said the two will be presented in court on Tuesday.
