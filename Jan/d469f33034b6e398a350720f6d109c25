The Teachers Service Commission has announced promotions for 1,000 diploma teachers. “Today we advertise for 1,000 promotion positions for diploma teachers. The online application portal will be available by end of the day,” the commission announced on Twitter. Diploma teachers in Kenya can work in either primary and secondary schools. Those applying will be seeking to fill the posts of Secondary teacher Level One, Senior Master Level Four, Deputy Principal Level Three, Senior Principal, Deputy Principal Level Two, Senior Lecturer Level Four. The promotion will be conducted under the 2018 Career Progression Guidelines. Under the guidelines, all teachers undertake set training in selected institutions before they can be considered for promotions. The institutions issue certificates filed by TSC to guide promotions. The guidelines disadvantage those in the Kenya National Union of Teachers that rejects the use of Career Progression Guidelines as the promotion criteria. Instead, the union has been battling for the revival of the collapsed guidelines used before 2018, better known as Schemes of Service. The Schemes of Service mainly used three-point criteria to consider the promotion of teachers, including higher education qualification, merit and years of experience. The application for the promotions comes to an end on February 9. The promotions come barely two months from another string of promotions that were announced in December for primary and secondary school teachers. Results from the first process are yet to be communicated.
