Kinoru Stadium in Meru could soon be approved to host international matches if the officials appointed by Football Kenya Federation to assess the facility return a positive report. The team of assessors led by FKF technical committee chairman Muriithi NabeaÂ  included international matches organising committee chairman Michael Majua and Meru County's CEC for youth and sports, Koome Miriti. Kinoru has recently played host to FKF Premier League matches with Tusker FC identifying it as their home ground this season. Given a Sh900 million facelift by the government in 2017, the facility boasts a capacity of 30,000. The venue was first commissioned for renovation in 2014 by the then Meru Governor Peter Munya. The stadium had been earmarked to host the 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN) but the Confederation of African Football (CAF) switched play to Morocco after the contractor failed to complete the job in good time. The venue has four changing rooms for teams and an extra two for match officials. There is also VIP Lounges, a press conference room and a media tribune. Plans are also underway to construct basketball, netball, tennis and volleyball courts within the precincts of the stadium.
