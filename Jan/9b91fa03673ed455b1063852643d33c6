A pickup belonging to a security company on Wednesday afternoon overturned on the mainland side of the Likoni ferry crossing. This comes about 10 hours after a truck plunged into the ocean at the same area. The pickup, belonging to SGA security company, was heading to Mombasa island from the Likoni mainland. It was carrying household goods, including a sofa set. The driver and another occupant in the car sustained slight injuries. According to witnesses, the pickup driver had just paid for the vehicle at the toll station when the brakes failed. The driver, sensing danger, with the prospect of plunging into the ocean, tried to swerve to make the vehicle stop. "In the process, it overturned about three times before landing upside down," said Omondi Oscar, a witness. Likoni residents now say the area is cursed and needs cleansing. "It is not normal that such things are happening with this kind of frequency. The owners of the sea want blood," said Mwachiponi Mwachiba. Mwachiba, who has lived in Likoni for over 60 years, said there needs to be an animal sacrifice to cleans the area. "In the past, there used to be an annual sacrifice here. The elders used to appease the gods of the sea by sacrificing goats, sheep or even cows. Just so there is blood," said Mwachiba. On Sunday morning, a Pollmans Tours and Safaris bus plunged into the sea after it slid off the ramp. The driver and his assistant were rescued by fishermen. Last Thursday, another truck belonging to Taiga Millers also lost control and plunged into the ocean. The driver escaped death narrowly after he was rescued by other fishermen. There have been calls for the ramps to be redesigned with motorists saying they are too steep. On Wednesday morning, Kenya Ferry Services managing director Bakari Goa said the ramp on the mainland side is steeper than that on the island side. "We are in discussion over that ramp. There may be need to make it less steep, but only if experts advise it," said Goa.
