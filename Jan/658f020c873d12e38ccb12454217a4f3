National champions Equity Bank and Kenya Ports Authority women’s team will represent the country in the Final Africa Club Championships slated for March in Egypt. Kenya Basketball Federation assistant secretary, Ambrose Kisoi, confirmed yesterday that the two teams received a bye to the tournament. “Equity Bank and KPA got a bye to play in the Africa Club Championships by virtue of being the only teams to confirm participation in the regional show,” he said. Kisoi revealed that Fiba Africa had tentatively set Marc 1-8 as the dates for the tournament. “The two teams are aware of the development from the continental body after being given the letters,” he said. The Zone Five Club tournament was planned for Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania last year but due to the Covid 19 pandemic, the event was called off. KPA, who lost the national crown to rivals Equity Bank, have recruited heavily and are already started training ahead of the season. Coach Anthony Ojukwu this week assembled his players to start training in readiness for the season that tips off next month. Meanwhile, Morans’ forward Tyler Ongwae was named as one of the 10 best players in Fiba Afro-Basket qualifiers first window in Kigali, Rwanda. The second window to decide the final 16 qualifiers for the championship is set for February 18-20 at a venue yet to be announced later.
