Kenya will move on to the new World Handicap System (WHS) on February 5 as the country seeks to replace the six existing systems around the world including ‘CONGU’ which is used in Kenya. Kenya Golf Union chairman, Ben Omuodo, said the WHS aims to broaden the handicap bracket, encourage more people to take up the game and enable golfers of differing abilities, gender and nationalities to compete on a fair basis anywhere in the world. The handicap system was launched in January 2020 in the USA, South Africa and a few other countries and was initially scheduled to be launched in Kenya in September 2020. “We could not launch it in September due to the delays occasioned by the movement restrictions instituted by the Government of Kenya from March to September of the same year to curb the spread of Covid-19,” said the chairman. Omuodo has in the meantime thanked a dedicated course rating team that went round all the golf clubs in Kenya to take all the measurements required in preparation for the WHS. “Unlike the USA and South Africa, Kenya was using the CONGU Handicapping system that did not require a Slope Rating. We needed to re-rate all the golf courses in Kenya to provide a slope rating that is the basis of playing golf using the WHS. We owe gratitude to the dedicated team of volunteers who have worked tirelessly to make this happen,” said Ben Omuodo. The Slope Rating is a numerical value that indicates the relative difficulty of a golf course for a bogey golfer in comparison to a scratch golfer. Each set of tees in Kenya have now been allocated a Slope Rating for men and women. All that is left at the moment is for Club Systems International, to integrate this with all the golfers records to come up with the new handicap index for all golfers.
