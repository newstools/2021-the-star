In a statement on Monday, Ipoa chairperson Anne Makori said that the fans of the event displayed a criminal act that interrupted the provision of security. At the same time, she said the police were on duty to disperse an unauthorized bullfighting gathering to enforce the government directives on Covid-19.

The injured officers including operation commander George Opere sustained injuries on the rib cage, mouth, shoulders, back, head, legs and hands after being hit with stones and clubs. They were treated at the Shibwe Level 4 Hospital and discharged. No casualties were reported among the public. Four police vehicles were also damaged during the confrontation between police and the locals.
