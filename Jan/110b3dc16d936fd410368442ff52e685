Deputy President William Ruto has reiterated that he will continue with his hustler narrative, adding 'every hustle counts'. "We will not buy your threats... saying you will bring DCI, KRA, EACC.... We will not go back. Kenya belongs to everyone and work is work," he said. Ruto spoke on Friday during a rally in Bomet. He was accompanied by Bomet Senator Christoper Langat, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen among others. The DP also reiterated his message that Kenya should not be divided on tribal lines. "There are people who were not happy Jubilee was uniting people and they hatched a plan to split the party so that Kenya is split. Even if they split the party, Kenya's unity will not be divided," he said. On Sunday, Uhuru said the Mt Kenya and the Kalenjin communities have produced the country’s four presidents since Independence and should pave the way other communities. “Even me, I can stand here and say there are only two Kenyan communities that have led. Maybe it's time for other tribes to lead. Kenya has many communities,” Uhuru said, getting a standing ovation from sections of the mourners. Ruto on Friday said meetings held at Jubilee's headquarters are only aimed at splitting the party. "To the point that the party cannot field a candidate for any by-election. Is that not a shame?" Ruto said, "We will not retreat, we will not surrender." He likened the idea of a rotational presidency based on tribe to a lottery. "We are not interested in leadership arrived at through a lottery... we want leaders to be elected based on their vision and manifesto." Ruto directly hit out at ODM leader Raila Odinga, saying, "You don't know the priorities of Kenyans." He said Raila's call for Kenyans to focus on a referendum is ill-placed.
