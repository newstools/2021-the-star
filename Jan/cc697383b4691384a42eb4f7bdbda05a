President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday arrived at Sagana State Lodge in Nyeri county for a four-day tour of Central Kenya, State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena Mararo has said. On Saturday, Uhuru will meet with leaders from the region at Sagana State Lodge, Dena said in a statement. The closed-door meeting, whose main agenda is development, will be open to all invited Central Kenya leaders. "The head of state will also hold meetings with the leadership and residents to discuss national programmes among them, the Big Four agenda, the Building Bridges Initiative, curriculum reforms and the fight against Covid-19," Kanze said. Dena said Uhuru will also launch several complete national government development projects and inspect ongoing programmes. The President's itinerary on the inspection of projects and the meet-the-people visits will be shared with the media by the office on a rolling basis. Uhuru's engagements during his working visit have been planned in strict compliance with the national Covid-19 containment protocols. Uhuru will also be looking into education matters. He has praised parents who took their children back to school at the beginning of this month after a nine-month break brought about by Covid-19. "As children settle in school after a long period of absence, the head of state would like to assure all parents that the government is committed to ensuring that learning continues uninterrupted," Dena said. Uhuru has also issued instructions to the Ministry of Education to devise ways of reintegrating children who became pregnant during the long break back to school. On schools fires, Uhuru warned those behind the destruction that the National Police Service is working with the Ministry of Education to deal decisively with anyone found culpable.
