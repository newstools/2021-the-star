A bus plunged into the Indian Ocean at the Likoni ferry crossing in Mombasa on Sunday morning. The bus belonging to Pollmans tours slid off the ramp owing to the heavy rains being experienced in the area. The bus driver was attempting to board the ferry MV Safari. "I tried to break but the bus kept on sliding," the driver Salim Omar said. The driver and his helper were rescued. Officers from the Kenya Ferry Services, Kenya Coast Guard and volunteers helped in pulling the bus out. A statement from Pollman Tours and Safaris confirmed the bus did not have any passengers on board as it had dropped them in Diani on Saturday evening. "We would like to thank KFS, Kenya coast guard and numerous members of the public who all came to help," Pollman's Group Director Of Operations Mohammed Hersi said. "As a leading tour company safety remains our topmost priority and we are grateful that there were no fatalities." In 2019, Mariam Kigenda, 36, and her daughter Amanda Mutheu, 4, died after their car plunged into the Indian Ocean. The two died after the vehicle they were travelling in veered off the rear ramp aboard the MV Harambee. More than 300,000 people and 6,000 vehicles cross the Likoni ferry channel every day. The Likoni ferry, which started operations in 1937, serves Mombasa from the Island to the mainland side of Likoni on the Kilindini Harbour.
