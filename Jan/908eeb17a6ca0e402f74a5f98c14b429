A father who defiled and impregnated his two teenage stepdaughters could face up to 40 years in jail after he pleaded guilty to the offences before a Baricho court. The man, 51, pleaded guilty two counts of defiling his two stepdaughters aged 16 and 14 years before senior principal magistrate Antony Mwicigi. The proceedings were held in an open court at the Baricho police station. The man’s first stepdaughter has a seven-month-old baby with him, while the other is allegedly five months pregnant for him. The charge sheet says the man committed the first offence between June 1 and 30, 2019. He committed the second offence between August 1 and 31 last year in Ndia constituency. Each offence carries a minimum jail term of 20 years. State prosecutor Patricia Gikunju asked the court to give her team up to January 7 to ascertain the girls’ ages at the time the crimes were committed. The suspect will be remanded at the Sagana police station until the next court session. Gichina was arrested on Sunday in Mbeere south from his hideout. Police had launched a manhunt for him early last month. Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici and her Uasin Gishu counterpart Gladys Shollei visited the girls’ family in December and condemned the crimes. “This act is totally unacceptable and if [the stepfather is] proved guilty, we will make sure the law deals firmly with him. He will be a lesson in Kirinyaga to all sex predators who think they can get away with it,” Ngirici warned. Shollei regretted such acts and promised to ensure that the girls continue with their education and get access to justice. She also urged the community to speak up should they witness or hear of any defilement cases.
