Reigning World Youth 1,500m champion Edna Jebitok made her debut in the senior cadre with a bang, winning the Athletics Kenya Nandi cross country meeting over the weekend. In an interview immediately after the race, she said she was using the event as a build-up for the Africa Cross Country Championships set for March 6-7  in Lome, Togo. With her first race into seniors, the World Under-18 1,500m silver medalist is hoping to win her first medal in the cross country during the event in the West Africa country but will have to overcome the final hurdle at the national cross country championships first on February 13. “I know the journey ahead of me is not easy but I have to keep up the fight and faith to secure national ticket to Lome. I have been doing well in juniors but I have to up my game since the senior category is not a joke,” said the 2019 Ndalat Gaa cross country junior champion. On Saturday, she beat Daisy Cherotich (34:03.74) and Betty Jepkemoi (34:50.30) to the podium to win the 10km senior women’s race in 34:00,03 to register her first win in the senior category.
