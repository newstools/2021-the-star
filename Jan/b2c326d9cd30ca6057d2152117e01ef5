A complaint has been filed against Justice Anthony Mrima, accusing him of bias in handling Nairobi Deputy Governor Anne Kananu's nomination case. Justice Mrima Friday declined to issue orders blocking the vetting of then-nominee Kananu by the county. Following the ruling, Kananu was vetted, approved and sworn in under five hours. Mrima had previously ruled similarly in another case filed by former Governor Mike Sonko. In his decision Friday, Mrima held that the petitioners had a case, but the court can take other remedial measures after the vetting. He also said there is no prejudice that will be suffered in the event the conservatory orders are not granted. Petitioner Henry Shitanda termed the ruling absurd and a confirmation of bias by the judge in his complaint before the Judicial Service Commission. Shitanda says the judge ignored the fact that Sonko had withdrawn  Kananu's nomination in December last year. The revocation letter has however been contested. The assembly told the court during proceedings in Sonko's case that the revocation letter was forged. Sitanda says Mrima should be removed because he is incompetent and has allowed the "sanitisation of the illegality by the county assembly".
