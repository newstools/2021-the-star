Mvita MP Adulswamad Nassir has asked his opponents to sell their policies to Mombasa residents as he is doing, instead of insulting their rivals. The MP, who is in the race for the Mombasa governor position, says his opponents have resorted to mud-slinging him, neglecting to say why they are suitable to serve. “There are those who, whenever they speak to sell their policies, must insult others,” Nassir said. He spoke during a meeting with women drawn from across the county who had gathered at Mbaraki Girls Primary School on Saturday. Nassir will potentially be facing off with businessman Suleiman Shahbal, Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo and former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar. All have declared interest in succeeding incumbent Hassan Joho. Deputy Governor William Kingi and former county secretary Francis Thoya are also in the race. On Saturday, Nassir said insults will not intimidate or stop him from going for the seat. In 2016, Nassir, after having had enough, warned politicians against tarnishing his late father’s name. He is the son of a former powerful Cabinet minister in the Moi era and long-serving Mvita MP Shariff Nassir. Nassir said his father’s legacy and wisdom passed down to him has endeared him to the people of Mombasa. “I was taught never to respond to insults with insults. For every insult, I will give them flowers and halua,” the MP said. He said politics should not be personal. “After politics, we will meet on the streets and greet each other,” he noted. The MP has instructed his campaign team to preach peace and unity wherever they go saying part of legacy, even if he does not win, should be that he promoted peace and unity. He cautioned Mombasa residents against falling prey to ‘false prophets’ who only appear when elections are near. Nassir said some politicians, after losing in elections, go underground only to emerge towards the next elections to vie again.
