Anne Kananu's vetting for the Nairobi Deputy Governor position will proceed on Friday. This is after Justice Anthony Mrima dismissed applications by activist Okiyah Omtatah and Habil Kongo. Mrima said the court is satisfied that there are fundamental issues of law that need to be determined. "Some of them are whether the nominee (Kananu) was legally nominated and was Sonko able to nominate Kananu when he had been illegally barred by an anti corruption court among other issues. For those reasons I find a prima facie case has been demonstrated in this matter." In the case, activist Okiyah Omtath and Habil Kongo have challenged the entire process of Kananu's nomination. The judge said the court is not convinced that the petitioners (Omatah and Kongo) have demonstrated any prejudice if the order is not granted. "There's no proof Kananu will be approved after vetting." "They (Omtath and Kongo) will not be prejudiced or their cases will not be compromised if the orders they are seeking to block the vetting are not issues." Stopping the constitutional process mediates against public interest, the court said. Public interest in this matter rules. Issues raised in the petitions established a prima facie case.
