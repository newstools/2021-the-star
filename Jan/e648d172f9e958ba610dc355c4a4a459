World 3,000 steeplechase champion Beatrice Chepkoech will be one of the star attractions at the first World Indoor Athletics Tour meeting in Karlsruhe on Friday. Chepkoech, who was able to piece together a respectable string of performances throughout 2020, will be making her 2021 debut in Karlsruhe and leads a strong 3000m line-up. The 29-year-old Kenyan has raced in the German city twice before, both times over 1500m, finishing third in 2018 and fourth in 2020. She holds the Kenyan indoor record for 1500m (4:02.09) and has the fastest outdoor 3000m PB of the entire field (8:22.92, set last year). Compatriot Gloria Kite and Ethiopia’s Fantu Worku will provide stiff opposition. Kite has an outdoor PB of 8:29.91, while Worku has notched up sixth-place finishes in her two most recent global championship appearances. European indoor bronze medallist, Melissa Courtney-Bryant, steeplechase specialist Mirusa Mismas and Germany’s Elena Burkard should all be in contention too. World 200m champion Asher-Smith is another standout athlete set to race in Karlsruhe. The 25-year-old, who hasn’t competed indoor for three years, has raced in Karlsruhe on three previous occasions, winning in 2015, placing third in 2016 and finishing second in 2017. She set her lifetime best of 7.08 when finishing second at the 2015 European Indoor Championships in Prague and matched that time in Glasgow in 2018 in what was her most recent indoor appearance. Asher-Smith’s opponents in Karlsruhe will include Ajla del Ponte of Switzerland, 2017 European indoor champion Asha Philip and world indoor finalist Carolle Zahi. Philip, the British record-holder, is the fastest in the field with a PB of 7.06. Del Ponte will be looking to revise her indoor PB of 7.17 after enjoying a breakthrough during the 2020 outdoor season. Zahi, meanwhile, recently clocked 7.19, her fastest time for three years. A meeting ‘bubble’ has been formed for Karlsruhe —as will be the case for all other World Athletics Indoor Tour meetings — and the total number of people allowed access to Karlsruhe’s Europahalle has been capped at 200, 120 of those athletes and no spectators.
