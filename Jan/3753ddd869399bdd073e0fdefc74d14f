The High Court has issued orders barring former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko from uttering any defamatory words against PS Internal Security Karanja Kibicho in relation to land grabbing claims. Justice Msagha Mbogholi issued the order after Kibicho through lawyer Fred Ngatia filed a case in court saying the false utterances by Sonko have damaged his character and reputation. He certified the matter as urgent and directed the case to be mentioned on February 11 for further directions. According to the court documents, Sonko on January 24 this year while addressing a public rally in Dagoreti South falsely stated and published words that Kibicho has associations with an individual or individuals involved in land grabbing. Sonko in the rally also said that Kibicho was involved in criminal activities during the election period in 2017. Kibicho says those false claims have since been published and aired in various media houses and the only way to avert further damage, is for the court to intervene and issue the orders. Kibicho says Sonko did not even bother to ascertain whether his words were factually correct before making such statements. "Sonko published the words being fully aware that they were false and with reckless disregard on the impact the words would have against me," he says. The PS says as a result, his reputation, character and credibility has been damaged. "Sonko's sole purpose is to tarnish my reputation and to divert public attention from the unfolding situations as the former Nairobi Governor," he said. "By repeating the malicious allegations, Sonko ha show diverted public attention from himself to me," says Kibicho.
