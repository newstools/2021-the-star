National Olympics Committee of Kenya (NOC-K) has been urged to diversify to ensure the country doesn’t over-depend on track and field for medals at the global championships. Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago said the country has what it takes to win medals across the board if the talent is anything to go by. “We have always relied on athletics for medals yet we have several other disciplines that can excel. Other countries have always capitalised on the situation to top the medal at our expense. This happens because they take keen interest in other disciplines, which we ignore,” said Mandago. He urged NOC-K to support the county in terms of technical expertise in other disciplines which they are keen to grow. “We are going to work together to ensure other disciplines also excel. As a county, we hope to start  the programme at ward level and NOC-K have assured us of their support," said the governor. He urged Sports Kenya to complete the Kipchoge Keino Stadium in time to host the National athletics Trials as it was the case in 2016. I am requesting NOCK to host the trials here as it was the case in 2016.  We also hope the camp will be here, Rugby Sevens camped in Kapsabet and i hope it will also be the case. I have no problem if  Iten and Kapsabet play a role in preparation of the Olympic teams because we all produce talent,” concluded Mandago. NOC-K president Paul Tergat, who led the delegation, said they are in the region to inspect facilities and visit camps as preparation for Olympic Games gain momentum. “Coronavirus pandemic has affected our sportsmen and women and we want to see how they are doing. You know most of them are on NOC-K scholarship and it is important for us to monitor their progress,” said Tergat.
