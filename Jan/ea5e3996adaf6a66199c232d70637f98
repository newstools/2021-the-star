Kiss FM presenter Jalang'o says he lost close friends and clients after he and friends were accused of cheating with different Nairobi girls. The allegations were shared by blogger Edgar Obare, with screenshots from a WhatsApp group that was believed to be that of Jalangâ€™o and his Boys Club. Speaking during the morning Kiss, Jalang'o said only his mother and wife stood by him. "Some clients pulled out and said they do not want to be associated with me," he said. "It got me to a corner and I said you know what, Heavy J, this is your moment either to come back or kill your career. I said you know what, I did not come this far to lose." Jalang'o said that very moment would have been the end of his career but he pulled through. "It is a test that I went through that almost killed my career."
