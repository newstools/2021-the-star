Companies world over saw their IT budgets rise by at least five per cent as coronavirus disrupted social-economic activities in 2020, the latest survey by KPMG shows. This, as 86 per cent of firms sampled indicated that they moved their workforce to remote working. At least  43 per cent of technology leaders expect over half their staff to remain working predominantly from home. The survey sampled over 4,200 respondents from chief information officers (CIOs) and technology executives across 83 countries. ''Firms had to pump more resources into their IT infrastructure to ensure continuity of activities. The cost varies depending on the size of the workforce and mandate,'' the report shows. Almost half (47 per cent) say the pandemic has permanently accelerated digital transformation and the adoption of emergent technologies, with over six in ten respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing that their influence has increased as a result of the pandemic. Cyber-security expertise was the most in-demand skill set, especially in the cloud and data security space for the time in this survey’s history, with security and privacy topping technology investments at 47 per cent. It was followed by customer experience and engagement (44 per cent), cloud infrastructure (35 per cent) and automation at 29 per cent. Three-quarters of respondents indicated that the attack surface and importance of cyber-security has increased as a result of Covid-19, with Spear phishing topping at 83 per cent, followed by Malware and Denial-of-service attack at 62 and 21 per cent respectively. ''The pandemic exposed a growing digital divide, shifted some priorities, and amplified many of the challenges that the IT organisation faced prior to Covid-19, key among them being cybersecurity,'' the report said.
