A Makadara court has denied bail to a guide accused of stealing a laptop and a braille notetaker from his visually impaired friend. George Oyula was on Wednesday arraigned for allegedly stealing the items valued at Sh535,000 from Andrew Kiyosi on December 14 at Accra Road in Nairobi. According to the police report, the complainant met Oyula at Nyayo House at the office of persons living with disability, where he used topick  him up and take him to the University of Nairobi. The complainant is pursuing a bachelors degree in Actuarial Science. The two had been friends for over two months. The court heard that Oyula had asked the complainant how much the gadgets cost and the complainant replied it was quite expensive. As they were walking towards the matatu bus stage, the complainant hit a hard surface and Oyula offered to help him carry his bag. The court heard that upon reaching the station, Oyula left the complainant for a while and said he needed to withdraw some cash from an M-Pesa shop. He later returned and handed over the bag to the complainant. The two were to board the same matatu but Oyula excused himself. It was while the complainant was inside the matatu that he realised his laptop and the braille notetaker were missing. The court heard that the accused had placed a huge stone inside the bag. Kiyosi reported the matter to Kamukunji police station. Oyula denied the charges before Makadara chief magistrate Heston Nyagah. The magistrate, who had earlier freed Oyula on Sh100,000 bail, revoked the bail terms after the complainant raised concerns over his safety. “The accused here has been calling and issuing threats. I have all the recordings of our phone conversations. There was a time when I was in town, and he called and told me he knows where I am. If he is freed on bail, he might do something to harm me,” he said. Nyaga ordered the suspect to be remanded at Kamukunji police station. The matter will be mentioned on January, 27.
