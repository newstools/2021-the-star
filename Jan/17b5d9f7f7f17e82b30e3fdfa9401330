The Judiciary will penalise all lazy staffers in its ranks, Acting Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu has said. Speaking in Mombasa during her first visit since taking her new role, Mwilu said officers must strive to give Kenyans the best services. She said she will work on reducing the many complaints she received while serving as the Judiciary ombudsman. “Many times I have been forced to intervene in complaints and through the many calls I have made, you find the files which were said to be missing have resurfaced,” she said. Mwilu added, “In some cases you find that the file was deliberately misplaced or in rare circumstances, someone was too lazy to pick the file from where it was and place it before the judge.” Mwilu urged staffers in Mombasa to serve citizens better so the complaints she has been receiving from the station can reduce. The acting Chief Justice urged judges and magistrates to write quality judgments which will set a precedent for others. “After this chitchat if anyone is found wanting, they will have themselves to blame,” she said.
