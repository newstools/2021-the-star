Kiss FM's Jalang’o has revealed that he has children with his wife Amina Chao. "Kila mtu amekuwa akisema patia bibi mimba, patia bibi mimba. Tulifunga hiyo mambo kitambo, only that I don’t post my children on social media," he said on Bonga na Jalas. He added that he gave his son a Muslim name since his wife is Muslim, and so he wanted to change the naming culture in his family. "I used to tell him my name is Felix Odiwuor Otuchi, but he said Dad, you are just Odiwuor, where does Otuchi come from? I tell him it’s from my Dad. My Dad is called Edward Otuchi. "He told me can I call myself Otuchi because 'You seem to be so proud of your Dad.' I said yes, why not. Then he told me can I spice it up? And now he calls himself King Otuchi."
