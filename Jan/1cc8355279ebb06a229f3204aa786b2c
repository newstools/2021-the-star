Mastercard Foundation has given small businesses in Kisumu Sh13 million to help them recover from the impact of Covid-19. Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kisumu branch chairman Israel Agina said more than 400 traders have benefited from the grant. He said more traders will be funded in the next phase. “This grant came at the right time when most businesses were struggling to recover,” he said. Agina said the renovation of the Kisumu port left many small businesses that were moved from the area to Dunga totally grounded. “Most of the people were caught off guard, their equipment and stalls ere destroyed,” Agina said. “The outbreak of Covid-19 came out to worsen the situation that was already bad,” he said. Agina said they are engaging other financial institutions to inject funds into the ailing sector. He said those whose structures were demolished will be relocated to Kisumu business park in Kamasi. Trader Jackline Akinyi said they were caught off guard. "We have loans to service, no food and we are left with no choice.” She said the funds from Mastercard Foundation will help revive majority of small businesses. “Currently we can’t import. We are not sure if we shall sustain ourselves in the business," Akinyi said.
