Vihiga farmers are set to receive Sh16.3 million to boost milk production in the county. The grant from National Rural Inclusive and Growth Project comes at a time most dairy farmers are struggling to sustain their milk business due to Covid-19 pandemic. The milk production in the county has dropped as farmers were not able to sustain production during the pandemic. Governor Wilber Ottichilo, while presenting the cheques to the farmers said the money will cushion them from the hard effects of the pandemic. Ottichilo challenged the farmers to do their best to increase milk production. “I want you to increase your production to 5,000 liters and above. That way, we are going to convert this to value addition,” he said. The governor said with increase in milk production, cheese, butter, Ice cream and yoghurt be produced in large volumes. He said the county has the potential of producing milk for commercial purposes and this can be achieved if the farmers have the right knowledge, technology and an enabling environment. Ottichilo said once the milk production increases, the county will set up a processing factory to ensure farmers don't incur losses. “Our farmers will also need to buy milk transportation vans, motor bikes and set up collection centres to curb time wastage,” Ottichilo said. He said farmers will also need to buy milk coolants, bulk tanks, deep freezers and other equipment. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi said the county administration is committed to building capacity for farmers to ensure Vihiga is food secure. “We are yet to fill the impact of these groups we are funding. We want you to do much better so that we don’t import food from other counties,” Saisi said. Agriculture executive Geoffrey Vukaya urged farmers to utilise the money well for its impact to be felt. Agriculture chief officer Pamela Busungu said the department is committed to doing and getting it right in dairy farming to ensure farmers rip maximum benefit from their ventures.
