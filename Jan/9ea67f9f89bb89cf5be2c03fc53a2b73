DCI detectives have arrested a Nigerian who was on the run following the gruesome murder of a prominent city lawyer. Christian Mwambay Kadima was arrested at his hideout at a lodging in the city. Kadima had tried to outsmart the officers by driving his getaway car to Riruta, to create a false impression on his whereabouts. "He is currently in lawful custody, being processed for his despicable act," DCI said. The sleuths said on Friday evening that the suspect who bears a Nigerian passport was spotted leaving the victim's house in Syokimau, Machakos County on Thursday night. The body of the lawyer was found in her bedroom on Friday morning. According to the police, the incident was confirmed by the lawyer's house help, who was suspicious that her employer was not awake at 10 am. She then walked into her bedroom only to find her lying lifeless on the bed, with bloody bruises on her body.
