Kiss FM presenter Kamene Goro has again been cyberbullied over her looks after someone called her a hippopotamus. Kamene shared a video on Instagram, addressing people who ooze negativity. "Today I left the house feeling super confident and felt I looked cute. Took a picture… Long story short, somebody called me a hippopotamus. I was like, eeh! Which had me thinking there is so much negativity out here in society and I don’t even know why," she said. She encouraged her fans to never allow other peoples' opinion to dictate how they should live their lives. "You’re beautiful and whatever struggle you’re going through right now is not bigger than the fight within you," she said. "You’re more than enough. No matter what, you’re a queen." Kamene previously called out Mulamwah over a crude joke about her weight.
