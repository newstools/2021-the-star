Gospel singer Daddy Owen says the reason he does not want to post images of his children on social media is because he wants to leave a positive legacy to them. Speaking to Massawe Japanni on Radio Jambo, Owen said despite being hated and mocked by many, he is still the father to his children. He is allegedly not living with his wife Farida Wambui. Asked if he is getting access to his children, Daddy Owen said, "People can laugh at me, make fun of my eyes, my masculinity and call me names, but not my children. That is why my children are not online. "That, I cannot discuss. What I can say is, at home mimi ni baba watoto, mume and kiongozi wa jamii yangu. Secondly, how I’m viewed out there is as a minister, star, while others hate you. Now when things happen in my life, what do I carry with me? What do I let go of? That is the question. Also, what legacy will I leave my children with? All this is to protect them." He also spoke about about going through depression since 2018. "At the time, no one in the family knew I was going through depression, and even when I started going for counselling, I did not tell anyone.I did not know I was suppressing issues that later affected me. One day it all exploded. That is when I had to seek help and dig deep into what was affecting me." Owen has been in the limelight for over 20 years doing gospel music, and he said he has not been tempted to leave the industry. "Music is just a vehicle to carry the ministry. I’m okay, I’m fine." Addressing the issues on his marriage that are fodder for netizens, Daddy Owen said, "Your life is not your life anymore. Anything you do or your actions have repercussions, and that is what I’m careful about as a parent. "Things happen but you have to be cognisant of what you want your children to grow up and read about the two of you."
