The Busia government will soon pay outstanding dues owed to community health volunteers and casual workers, Deputy Governor Moses Mulomi has assured. He said casuals and CHVs are expected to receive payments for two and four months respectively based on available funds. Mulomi spoke Khunyangu Hospital in Butula subcounty on Wednesday. The deputy governor said the national government’s delay in the disbursement of funds to counties contributed to the late payment of the stipends. “The truth of the matter is that we have had financial challenges since July 2020, but we are happy to announce that the supplementary budget was passed by the assembly and assented to by Governor Sospeter Ojaamong, thus unlocking the funds.” Mulomi emphasised that the county government is committed towards ensuring that health facilities have laboratories, theatres, maternities and X-ray machines to ensure residents get medical services. He was accompanied by chief officers Isaac Omeri (Medical Services) and Jonathan Ino (Public Health). Omeri said Sh6 million has been set aside for the construction of a mortuary at the Khunyangu Subcounty Hospital. “We used to look at the mortuary as a bad place, but you realise that those who die need decent handling. The current allocation is Sh6 million but if the need arises for additional funds, they will be allocated.” The chief officer said there are plans to build a morgue at the Sio-Port Subcounty Hospital.
