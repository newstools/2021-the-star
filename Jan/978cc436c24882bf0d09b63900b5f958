The Kenya National Union of Teachers has pleaded with the government to save it from imminent collapse. Assistant secretary general Clement Gicharu said Knut’s membership has nosedived from 183,000 to less than 23,000. Gicharu accused the Teachers’ Service Commission of deliberately devastating its operation to gag teachers. He spoke during Murang’a South Knut elections at Karigu-ini Primary School on Saturday. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and ensure the union is restored back to its original form. “Knut is the only voice of teachers in the country. If the President stops the devastation being undertaken by our employer, we pledge to support him even in his retirement,” Gicharu said. He wondered why TSC continues to remit the Kenya Union of Post Primary Teachers (Kuppet) union dues, yet refuses to do the same for Knut. He said Knut fought for the creation of TSC and dismantling the union was a dishonour to teachers. But even with all the trouble the union is undergoing, Gicharu said teachers flocked polling stations to vote in new leaders and show solidarity. "Contrary to propaganda being spread, union’s secretary general Wilson Sossion has nothing to do with Knut’s woes," he said. Murang’a South secretary general John Njata said Knut fought for a collective bargaining agreement signed with the government in 2017 that sought to ensure teachers were promoted, but members are now being denied the opportunity. He said TSC has eased the process of getting out of the union and made it available on mobile phones yet the process of joining in is long and hectic. The branch has only 500 teachers left from a membership of 2,400. Due to lack of remittances, Njata said many branches had been closed as they were unable to pay rent. Others that had acquired loans to buy buses to facilitate teachers’ activities have been auctioned. “We have  court orders stopping TSC from destroying us, but they have been ignored. Only the President can save us now,” he said.
