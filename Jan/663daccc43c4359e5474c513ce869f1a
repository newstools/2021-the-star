Newly appointed Murang’a Seal coach Vincent Nyaberi faces herculean task of lifting the team from bottom of the National Super League log. Nyaberi, who parted ways with former giants Shabana FC in December, thanked Muranga Seal chairman, Robert Macharia for giving him an opportunity to steer the team. Nyaberi takes over from David Mahira. “I’m happy to be in the dugout again. I know I have a tough task in lifting the team from bottom of the log but I’m confident we shall make it,” said the former defender. Nyaberi, who watched the team’s narrow 1-0 defeat against Modern Coast at St Sebastian Park in Murang’a, said the players lacked fitness. “I watched the game and I have identified weak areas which I’m working on ahead of the next game,” he said.  He said he is targeting to sign at least six players in the current transfer window which opened on Monday. “The philosophy of the club’s owner is to identify and nurture young players. I’m targeting young players who can help the team. The advantage we have as  Murang’a Seal is that we have an academy,” he added. His first match will be against his former side Shabana at Gusii Stadium on Sunday. Commenting on the match, Nyaberi said: “It’s a game like any other, nothing special." However, I’m going to Gusii for a positive result. In a football, every team wants to win.  Shabana have recorded impressive results in the recent past and we start as underdogs against them,” said Nyaberi. Shabana are unbeaten in the last four games under caretaker coach Joseph Ongoro. They have recorded three wins and one draw since Nyaberi left the financially troubled Kisii-based side. Shabana are 8th on the table with 11 points, three shy of log leaders Fortune Sacco.
