Kenya will use the World Under 20 Athletics Championships trials set for July 2-3 at Moi Stadium, Kasarani as a dry run for the global event, also scheduled for Karasani on August 17-22. Athletics Kenya executive committee member Barnaba Korir said the trials will be crucial in analysing their preparedness for the event as they seek to surpass the gains made during the 2017 World U18 Championships held at the same venue three years ago. Kenya were to host the event in July last year but the event was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Korir said they count the postponement as a blessing in disguise since it means more time to prepare for the event. "We have had time on our side to prepare for the event owing to the postponement of the event by one year," said Korir. "We had our first meeting of this year on Monday to look at where we are and I can assure the general public that come the time for the championships, we will be ready,‚Äù added Korir. "The trials in July will be a good indicator of how Team Kenya has prepared for the event. The equipment to be used at the trials will most likely be used in the world event and so it will definitely tell us of our strengths and weaknesses and what areas we need to improve on." Korir said they learned valuable lessons from the Kip Keino Classic held in October last year. "It was a good eye-opener for us to see what we need to do and the areas we must strengthen," he added. Speaking separately, WU-20 Chief Executive officer Mike Rabar said the Moi Stadium, Kasarani is in good shape with only some minor tweaks expected to be done to make it ready for the event. Rabar said the running track is in good shape and only the press tribune, hospitality and sponsors boxes need some renovations. "We don't want to do things at the last minute. We want to have a world-class event and preparations must to be thorough to attain such standards," he said.
