National Super League outfit, Kisumu All Stars head coach Salim Babu has vowed to guide the team back to the top tier next season. “Our target is a quick return to the Kenya Premier League. We have a very good team with experienced players who have played in the KPL. I will be banking on them in the journey back to the top tier,” Babu said. He said the team, sponsored by the Kisumu County Government, did not lose many players in last transfer window. “I’m happy we have retained most  players who were part of the team in the KPL last season,” added the experienced coach who left moneybags Wazito after a short stint together with head coach Fred Ambani. Over the weekend, Kisumu All Stars battled to a barren draw against Sony FC at Moi Stadium in Kisumu. “This is a game we should have killed in the first half because we wasted many chances. In the second half, the game was 50-50. We look forward to the next game,” said Babu. On Saturday, the Blue Eagles will play the newly promoted Mully Children’s Family (MCF) in Nairobi. MCF were promoted to take the place of the defunct Ushuru. Babu, a KPL winner with Sony FC, has in the past coached Sony and Western Stima in the top tier league. The club is fourth on the log with eight points from four games and remains unbeaten. Kisumu All Stars were relegated from the KPL after losing on penalties to Vihiga United in a KPL/NSL relegation and promotion play-off in Kisumu.
