A majority of Jubilee supporters would vote Deputy President William Ruto as president if elections were held today. Only the 12 per cent of the Jubilee adherents who support President Uhuru Kenyatta would reject the DP at the ballot, according to a Tifa poll. The survey by pollster Tifa, reveals that Jubilee Party has a popularity rating of 33 per cent among Kenyans, with 21 per cent of them ready to back Ruto. This means the majority of Jubilee supporters lean towards Ruto's Tangangata faction powered by the hustler movement. Raila Odinga's ODM party has a national approval of 18 per cent. President Uhuru and Raila are working together although both have denied their handshake has 2022 political interests. However, Ruto has sustained an aggressive campaign to position himself as the man to beat in next year's general election despite his falling out with Uhuru after the handshake nearly three years ago. Uhuru's camp is concerned that Ruto has brainwashed Jubilee supporters and vanquished the President even in his own Mt Kenya backyard. According to the poll released on Friday, 42 per cent of Kenyans do not support any political party, providing a platform for Raila and Ruto to battle for numbers ahead of next year. Wiper has a national rating of one per cent while Ford Kenya, ANC and Kanu have a one per cent approval countrywide. The poll shows ODM members are the most supportive of a referendum before 2022. Those who support Jubilee and are aligned with Ruto are the least enthusiastic about a referendum before next year's general election.
