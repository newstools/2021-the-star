Barely a month after Bidco United head coach Anthony Akhulia lamented over lack of home advantage in their league matches, Zoo FC boss Herman Iswekha has also raised similar concerns after a false start in the 2020-2021 campaign. The Kericho-based outfit are the only top flight side yet to savour a win this season and Iswekha has partially attributed the current mixed results to lack of home comfort. The club has played three matches, sharing spoils with Bandari and Posta Rangers and losing 2-0 to Mathare United in their last outing on Monday at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Initially, Zoo staged their home matches at the Kericho Green Stadium but are now forced to play at the Afraha Stadium,Nakuru. The Football Kenya Federation Premier League stadia committee recently inspected the facility and Iswekha is appealing for their verdict on whether the facility is suitable to host league matches. Similarly, Bidco have had to play matches either at the Kasarani Annex or the Utalii grounds, thanks to the renovation works at the Thika Stadium. Iswekha said it was unfair and costly to play home duels at Afraha, a venue he claimed did not resonate well with his troops. "Had we played the first two rounds at Kericho, I believe we would have garnered maximum points. The players are not used to training at Nakuru and thus struggle to win matches convincingly there. It is also costly to travel to Nakuru for a home match which was not the case before," heÂ  lamented
