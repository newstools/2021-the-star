Former Gor Mahia assistant coach Patrick Odhiambo is expected to hit the ground running at Kakamega Homeboyz on Monday next week after agreeing to join the club. Odhiambo quit Gor in December last year after the first leg of the Caf Champions League duel away to CR Belouizdad under unclear circumstances but is scheduled to return to coaching next week at Homeboyz, deputising Nicholas Muyoti. The soft-spoken tactician, who was initially on Bandari’s radar, revealed Homeboyz won his signature thanks to the offer they tabled and further admitted that he wanted be close to his family. Despite taking the Homeboyz offer, Odhiambo will be unavailable when they take on Bandari this weekend at the Mbaraki Stadium as the team had already left by the time he was confirmed. “I have joined Homeboyz but I will link up with the team on Monday after they return from Mombasa. I had offers but Homeboyz offered favourable terms and working with them will enable me to be close to my family unlike at Gor, where I would have limited time with them,” he said. The former Sony Sugar tactician, who joined Gor in June 2019, replacing Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno who quit the club for KCB said joining Homeboyz was an easy decision to take and promised to work with Muyoti to better their results. “ The club has good players whom I believe will shake off the poor start and perform better than last season. Muyoti is a good coach and I am looking forward to work with him to deliver in line with the expectations of the management and fans,” he said In the meantime, the former Chemelil Sugar gaffer blamed injuries and illness in the Homeboyz’s camp for the false start in the season. The club has registered five points out of a possible eighteen “ The team didn’t start well due to injuries and sickness but the affected players most of whom are experienced are slowly regaining their form and within a short time, we will recover,” he added.
