A team of livestock officers has concluded talks with communities on how best to use grazing lands in Buna and Bute subcounties in Wajir North. Wajir North livestock production officer Hassan Guyo and Wajir principal livestock production officer Julius Kienji said they sensitised stakeholders on participatory rangelands management. The team met the stakeholders between January 11 and 18, in Godoma, Danaba, Gurar and Bute wards. “The activity follows an action plan developed after livestock production staff had training of trainers workshop on PRM in Isiolo county earlier in 2019,” Guyo said. Guyo said participatory rangeland management has been developed as a means for policymakers and change agents from governmental and NGOs to support communities to manage their rangelands. PRM involves planning and decision-making at different levels. He said the principles and methods used in PRMs have been drawn from the Nairobi-based International Livestock Research Institute’s studies. "This approach typically works through a community organisation made up of representatives of all people within a specified geographic area, a rangeland unit," Guyo said. Kienji said the engagement with community stakeholders are twofold – sensitising them on the importance of participatory rangeland management and to discuss the effective process of establishing a functional committee.
