Former Shabana players have donated an assortment of sports equipment to Kisii Youth Olympic Academy. The Shabana legends, led by their coordinator Peter Kamau aka Kass Kass, donated balls, bibs and space markers to the talent centre as one of giving back to society. “We came together as Shabana legends and decided to do something for this talent centre. This centre produced several players for Shabana together with Itierio Boys and Kisii School. This will be like an academy of Shabana,” said Kamau during a brief ceremony at Getembe Primary School. He added: “We want this centre to produce the next generation of the likes of Henry Motego, Mike Okoth, Richard Otambo, Evans Nyariki, Shem Nyaberi, Peter KamauFrazier Ochieng and Moses Gikenyi among others. The equipment we donated are key in the development of players technically,” said Kamau. The recent players produced by the academy are Vodacom Premier League side’s Biashara United left back Bolton Omwenga, Kariobangi Sharks midfielder Douglas Mokaya and Shabana’s speedy winger Ashif Obwaka among others. Kamau said Shabana former players among them Switzerland-based Frazier Ochieng, US-based Henry Mosoti, UK-based Moses Gikenyi, Belgium-based Mike Okoth, Rashid Omar, Yobesh Mose, Salim Mabrouk and Jared Ombongi  among others fund raised to boost the academy. Kamau further noted that the legends are planning to motivate and mentor the current Shabana players. “I believe we have a role to revive the 'Tore Bobe' spirit. This club should be playing in the Kenya Premier League,” said Kamau. Mose said: "We believe our support to them will have a big influence in improving their game and helping their  fitness levels which is required to get to the next level of their career,” said Mose. Francis Ontita, 17, thanked the Shabana legends for the gesture. “This will motivate us to achieve our dreams. My dream is to play professional football,” he said.
