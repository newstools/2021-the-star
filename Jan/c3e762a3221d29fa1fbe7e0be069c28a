Nigerian human rights lawyer Femi Falana has filed a complaint on behalf of Uganda's Bobi Wine. The lawyer filed a complaint to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Arrest. "We are challenging my continued illegal confinement by the Ugandan police and the military," Wine posted via Twitter on Wednesday. In the complaint, the lawyer said the opposition leader is being held without any criminal charges preferred against him. Wine was the main opposition candidate in the concluded Ugandan General. The singer-turned politician Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, posted on his Twitter account that he was running out of basic commodities since he and his family are unable to move out of the house, which he said is surrounded by the military. “Day Six under house arrest and we're still stuck with an 18-month-old baby who had paid a visit to her auntie (my wife) before we were raided and besieged,” Wine said. Wine emerged second in the election, which was won by the incumbent Yoweri Museveni. According to the electoral commission, Museveni won 5.85 million votes, equal to 58.6 per cent, as Wine had 3.48 million votes, 34.8 per cent of the votes cast. Wine had claimed that the election was marred by irregularities in favour of the incumbent but he is yet to prove his claims.
