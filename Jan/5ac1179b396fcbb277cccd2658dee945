New kid on the blocks Dorcas Jepchirchir is eyeing Discovery Kenya cross country title this weekend at the Eldoret Sports Club. Jepchirchir has been on a roll since December when she placed second in the BOclassic 10km road race in Bolzano, Italy, behind Margaret Chelimo. The former University of Eldoret cross country champion said she is looking beyond the Kenyan borders and wants to compete in the Africa Cross country Championships in Lome, Togo scheduled for May 1-2. She said Discovery will serve as a build-up for the upcoming events. “Discovery x-country is one of the best meetings in the country and running the race will no doubt give me psyche ahead of the next major meeting,” she noted. “The race normally attracts top athletes in the country and even finishing in the top 10 is an achievement for me. the event will prepare me well in terms of endurance and speed ahead of the national trials," she noted. Meanwhile, Discovery Kenya race organisers have increased the prize money for this year’s event. According to the new scales, winners in the men and women's 10km categories will now bag Sh25,000 up from the previous Sh20,000. The prize money will also spill down to the junior cadre, where the boys' 8km and girls' 6km winners will pocket Sh15,000 up from Sh10,000. Race director, David Letting, said top ten finishers in each category will also get cash prizes. “We have decided to increase the prize money in this year’s event because our athletes have suffered a lot due to the current Covid-19 situation. We therefore urge athletes to turn up in large numbers as registration is free. Our intention is actually to support our athletes,” Letting noted. This year, there will be no children and fun races that have always been associated with Discovery since inception 30 years ago.
