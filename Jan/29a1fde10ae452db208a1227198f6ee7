The Pharmaceutical Society of Kenya (PSK), has cautioned the public against the unprescribed use of Sildenafil, Tadalafi, Vardenafil and Avanafil drugs commonly known as the "Blue Pill". PSK advised the public not to take these pills without the advice of a qualified medical practitioner and a valid prescription. "The use of these medicines without prior medical evaluation makes one more prone to their harmful effects," PSK said in a statement released on Friday. The effects have been categorized from mild to moderate and they include headache, nose bleeding, discomfort and pain in the upper abdomen, trouble falling and/or staying asleep, redness of the skin, diarrhoea, dizziness and skin rash. As for the severe side effects, one is likely to experience a mild and short-lived decrease in blood pressure, vision loss, Priapism (unwanted persistent erection) and potential for cardiac risk with sexual activity in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Patients with underlying conditions and those who are on other medications may be more at risk of the mentioned effects. "We caution the public to refrain from accessing the medicines without a full evaluation, diagnosis and prescription by a qualified medical practitioner," PSK said. PSK added that it urges those with valid prescriptions to obtain their medicines from only legally registered pharmacies. "A legally registered pharmacy must have on display a health safety code issued by the Pharmacy and Poisons Board," PSK said.
