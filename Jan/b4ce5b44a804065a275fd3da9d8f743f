The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has verified 1.14 million BBI signatures. The commission verified 1,140,845 registered voters. This is out of the 4.2 million signatures collected by the BBI team led by the Orange Democratic Movement last year. IEBC only needed to verify one million signatures. With the verification, it means that the BBI Bill will be transmitted to the 47 county assemblies. In a letter seen on Tuesday, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said notified the assemblies that the Initiative has met the requisite threshold as provided in Article 257 (4) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. "...the Commission hereby submits a copy of the draft BBI (Constitutional Amendment) Bill 2020, to your County Assembly for consideration within three months from the date hereof," Chebukati said. If a county assembly approves the draft Bill, the speaker of the county assembly shall deliver a copy of the draft Bill jointly to the Speakers of the two Houses of Parliament, with a certificate that the county assembly has approved it. Article 157(7) says that if the draft Bill has been approved by a majority of the county assemblies, it shall be introduced in Parliament without delay. If a majority of the members of each House pass the Bill, it shall be submitted to the President for assent. On Thursday, the electoral commission, in a notice published after verification of about 1.3 million signatures, asked voters to confirm if they indeed signed. “Anyone who has been captured as a supporter without their consent can report to the commission by writing to the CEO indicating their objections.” IEBC had sought Sh241 million for the verification before they negotiated with the National Treasury for Sh97.3 million.
