Vihiga United head coach Sammy Okoth is opposed to a proposal floated by the county government to set aside 70 per cent of playing slots in the team strictly for players drawn from the area. Okoth spoke after Vihiga County sports CEC Patrick Saisi sparked off debate with suggestions that both Vihiga United and Vihiga Queens should absorb 70 per cent of the players from the area. "We want both Vihiga United and Vihiga Queens to take 70 percent of their players within Vihiga County," said Saisi. Speaking to Star via the phone yesterday, Saisi said the remaining 30 percent should be spread across the country to strengthen the clubs. He said the two clubs that are currently in the Kenyan top tiers should spearhead campaigns to nurture local talent. Vihiga Queens are currently at the apex of Kenya Women's Premier League while United sit in position 15 on the Kenyan Premier League log. “We want to make use of the two clubs to improve on our talents and also to ensure most of the youths are benefiting from these resources we are pumping into these clubs,” Saisi said. Okoth, however, insists he will only use the same players who propelled the side to KPL. "It's not a must that we go for new players. The same charges who made their efforts to go back to the premier league have the ability to excel. The only thing these boys need is support, that's all," said Okoth. Saisi wants the two clubs to serve as a leeway window for youths in the county to sell out their talents and open space for the upcoming youths within the county. “We shall fully support these teams in the  KPL and WPL as well as those in the National Super league as well,” Saisi said. He said all this should be done in the good interest of the two clubs.
