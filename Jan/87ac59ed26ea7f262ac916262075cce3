"The reality is we can expect a bit of a surge in January, but hope it slows," he said. He also said Kenya has ordered vaccines which will not be mandatory. Healthcare workers and police will be prioritised. Kagwe said Kenya will not rely on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, but is in negotiations with a China firm among others that have been approved. On reopening on schools on Monday, Kagwe said masks are now part of uniform. "When you are sending your child to school, a mask is part of it, and ideally, two reusable ones... the government will support those who are unable (to buy masks)," he said. Kagwe said for classes that cannot cater for social distancing, learning will take place outside in playing fields.
