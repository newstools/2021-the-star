US Ambassador Kyle McCarter has bid farewell to Kenyans as he exits from his position after four years. In a video posted on Wednesday, McCarter said being U.S. Ambassador was the greatest honour of his life. "...and an extraordinary opportunity to serve my country for the benefit of the American and Kenyan people," he said. "I am sad to announce that this privilege is coming to an end today when I will resign my post. And I am proud of what the two countries have achieved." McCarter said the United States will continue to help Kenya to be a prosperous economy. "The US will continue aid through education  The free trade negotiations will make Kenya more competitive," he said. He said Kenya's success will shame those who rob Kenyans of their hard-earned money. "I leave my post inspired by the dedication and vision of the Kenyan youth. Be sure you put your feet in the right place. Sisemi Kwaheri lakini tutaonana," he said. On Tuesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta reiterated Kenya’s determination to conclude ongoing negotiations with the US and sign a Free Trade Agreement. Uhuru gave the assurance when he bade farewell to outgoing US Ambassador to Kenya who paid him a courtesy visit at State House, Nairobi. Kenya and the US launched trade negotiations on 8th July 2020 with the aim of crafting a comprehensive FTA that will serve as a model for similar pacts across Africa. The head of state thanked the US Government for the support Kenya continues to receive in the security sector especially the fight against terrorism and the response against Covid-19. On his part, Amb McCarter thanked Uhuru and the people of Kenya for making his two-year tour of duty in the country successful. “I am a fortunate man to have served Kenya as US ambassador. I will be visiting Kenya from time to time and I hope I will be able to bring more investors,” McCarter told Uhuru.
