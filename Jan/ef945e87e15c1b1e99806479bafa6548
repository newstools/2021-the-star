Musalia Mudavadi's Amani National Congress Party has asked Deputy President William Ruto to resign or face impeachment over his remarks at the weekend. ANC deputy party leader Ayub Savula said the DP's attack on President Uhuru Kenyatta warrants calls for his resignation. "He called the President a tribalist. How can you say your boss is a tribalist?" he stated. Speaking at ANC headquarters in Nairobi on Tuesday, Savula said the President only meant that Kenya has leaders from other communities who can lead the country when he addressed mourners in Vihiga County last weekend. The Lugari MP said he would table an impeachment motion if Ruto will not resign. "He says he has 150 MPs in the National Assembly. We'll see about that very soon. Insulting the President is against the Constitution," he added. With Savula were Women Rep Vihiga County Beatrice Adagala, Teso North MP Oku Kaunya, ANC Youth League Spokesman Nathaniel Mong'are and several other party officials. Adagala said the Deputy President should be assisting the President to implement his development agenda but is instead drumming support for his 2022 bid. "What the President said is the truth. If he is unhappy, he should resign," said the Vihiga woman representative. The DP on Sunday said he supported Uhuru thrice, knowing that he was a Kikuyu and the son of a former President. He said he rallied behind Uhuru with Kibaki still at State House in a deliberate move to end what he termed “the politics of stupidity of grouping people in tribes". The DP rebutted Uhuru who on Saturday gave the clearest hint he will not back Ruto for the presidency and may in fact campaign against him. Uhuru said the Mt Kenya and the Kalenjin communities have produced the country’s four presidents since Independence and should pave the way other communities.
