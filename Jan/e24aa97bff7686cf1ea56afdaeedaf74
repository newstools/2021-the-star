Urbanus Ngengele Muthama will fly United Democratic Alliance's (UDA) flag in the March 18 Machakos senatorial by-election. Ngengele was on Friday issued a nomination certificate as the candidate ending days of negotiation for the ticket. Former Senator Johnston Muthama, who is also the UDA national chairman, said the party resorted to a scientific method to identify a flagbearer from a pool of 16 aspirants who had shown interest in the seat. Ngengele will now battle it out with Mutham's ex-wife Agnes Kavindu who will fly Wiper's flag and Maendeleo Chap Chap's Mutua Katuku. Muthama was accompanied by former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, Vincent Munyaka (Machakos Town) Nixon Korir (Langata) and Vincent Musau (Mwala) during the issuing of the certificate. Deputy President William Ruto had on Thursday unveiled Ngengele as his preferred candidate. Ruto unveiled Ngengele at his Karen residence. The DP said that he was grateful to witness the partnership forged by the Machakos Senate by-election hopefuls in favour of Ngengele. Ruto described Ngengele as a hustler from the county.
