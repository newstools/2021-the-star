The Ugandan High Court issued an order on Monday barring the military from surrounding the home of the main opposition leader, Bobi wine. The police have been camping outside Robert Kyagulanyi’s home in Kampala for 11 days. The siege started on January 14, 2021, when the country held its general election where Wine was seeking to unseat President Yoweri Museveni. But despite the court order, Wine claimed through his Twitter account that the police were still in his home, hours after the ruling. “The High Court ruled this morning that my continued house arrest (11 days now) is illegal and unconstitutional. Several hours later, the military still surrounds my home, blocking access to all,” Bobi Wine said. Last week, the singer-turned politician posted that he was running out of basic commodities since he and his family are unable to move out of the house, which he said is surrounded by the military. According to the electoral commission, Museveni won 5.85 million votes, equal to 58.6 per cent, as Wine had 3.48 million votes, 34.8 per cent of the votes cast. Wine had claimed that the election was marred by irregularities in favour of the incumbent, but he is yet to prove his claims.
