The government will fence off water sources that feed big rivers, to stop them being contaminated. Water CAS Andrew Tuimur says beds of streams and rivers will be cleaned to remove solid waste. He said they are partnering with environment stakeholders to ensure clean water flowing has been protected from the source. "We protect the sources, but that water gets contaminated before it joins other rivers. We want to protect both, that is the sources and the banks. We want to ensure all streams, rivers as well as wells have clean water," Tuimur said. He spoke at Ondiri Swamp in Kikuyu sub county in Kiambu, when he visited the reservoir to inspect how it was fenced. He said the 3.7 km fencing was done by Water Resource Agency at tune of Sh4 million and 7,000 trees, which are friendly to water sources, were planted before the end of last year. "We are not doing this to Ondiri only, even in other areas. We want by 2030 to have handled all water sources, springs and rivers to ensure clean water is protected." He was accompanied Water Resource Authority CEO Mohamed Shurie, Director Forestry and Natural Resources Wakang'u Kiarie, Kikuyu deputy county commissioner  Tom Macheneri, and Friends of Ondiri Wetland coordinator David Wakogi. Wakogi applauded the government because of that strategy, saying it realised the great work being done by environmental groups. "We have been mobilising resources, urging people and well-wishers to support local groups offering to conserve environment.  We are happy to know the plan the government have. We shall support it," Wakogi said.
