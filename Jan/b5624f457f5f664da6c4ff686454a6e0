More than 5,000 mothers in Vihiga county have been enrolled in the Ottichilo Care programme. The programme, which started in November 2018 as  Boresha Afya ya Mama na Mtoto, aims at encouraging pregnant women and mothers to attend antenatal and postnatal clinics in government health facilities. Governor Wilber Ottichilo said since the inception of the programme, the maternal mortality rate has reduced significantly. The governor spoke at Emuhaya Hospital in Luanda subcounty on Thursday afternoon after visiting mothers’ enrolled in the programme. “It’s clear that the incentive to beneficiaries under the Ottichilo Care programme should not be the main focus, but health education the mothers receive during antenatal and postnatal clinics should be the priority,” Ottichilo said. He praised healthcare workers and community health volunteers for the selfless effort that they have put in ensuring that mothers receive quality services. Public Health chief officer Mary Anyiendah urged residents to encourage young girls who conceived during the Covid-19 period to come out and be enrolled in the programme.
