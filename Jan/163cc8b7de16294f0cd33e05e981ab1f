At 7.15pm on March 30 last year, police enforcing a nationwide 7pm curfew hurled tear gas canisters into the home of Bernard Orenga in Nambale. They then stormed the homestead and beat him up with his wife and children. They also beat up his neighbours. Orengaâ€™s was the experience of many Kenyans across the country. Now, the public prosecutor wants the officers prosecuted. Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has announced criminal charges against the officers. Fifteen police officers and six Busia county enforcement officers will be arraigned and charged with assault during Covid-19 curfew operations. Police watchdog Ipoa has said other charges will include causing actual bodily harm, malicious damage to property and attempting to injure by an explosive substance. "Additionally, the Ward Commander who led the operation will also be charged with the offence of negligence in the discharge of official duty," IPoa chair Anne Makori said. The officers will take plea on February 1 in Bungoma. The authority is still investigating incidents that happened during the curfew. Already, the policeman who shot and killed 13-year-old Yassin Moyo in Huruma has been charged with murder.
