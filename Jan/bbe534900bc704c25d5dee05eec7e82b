Biden goes on to say that the protesters yesterday, who were are largely white crowd, were not treated aggressively by police partly due to their race. "Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol yesterday." He says that his granddaughter yesterday texted him a photo from the racial justice protests over the summer that triggered an aggressive reaction from authorities in DC. The picture, Biden says, showed police in riot gear standing on the steps of the Lincoln Monument in DC to oppose those that rallied against police brutality and racism. He describes yesterday as "one of the darkest days in the history of our nation" and "an assault, literally, on the citadel of liberty". "It was not dissent, it was not disordered," Biden continues. "It was chaos," he continues saying those at the capitol were not protesters, but instead a "riotous mob" and "domestic terrorists". "And I wish we could say we couldn’t see it coming. But that isn’t true. We could see it coming," he says. "The last four years we’ve had a president who made his contempt for our democracy, our Constitution, our rule of law, clear," he says. "He unleashed an all-out assault on the institutions of our democracy from the outset," continues Biden.
