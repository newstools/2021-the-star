Churches and humanitarian organizations operating in North Rift region have claimed they are enable to access the volatile Kapedo area to deliver relief food to hundreds of starving families. According to Dominic Kimengich of the Eldoret Catholic Diocese, the area has been rendered in accessible due to the massive security operation launched by government to crack down on armed bandit linked to a spate of killings and displacement of families. The clergy said several tones of relief supplies that were donated by the church and non-governmental organization including Red Cross are lying idle in Eldoret and yet the targeted families are staring at death due to lack of good shelter and water. Speaking to the press in Eldoret, Kimengich asked the government to intervene by providing security escortÂ  to enable them dispatch the consignment of food supplies to the displaced families in the volatile Kapedo area. "The government should look for criminals and ensure innocent people are protected." Said Bishop Kimengich. Bishop Kimengich also advised the government to carry out its operation in a humane manner so as to avoid harming innocent people who have nothing to do with insecurity that has rocked the area where several lives have been lost among them, police officers and government officials. He implored upon the government to ensure all illegal fire arms are recovered from the bandits claiming that the weapons are the cause of perennial violent attacks against innocent people in Kerio Valley for decades.
