ODM party has overruled the decision taken by its Machakos branch to support the Maendeleo Chap Chap aspirant in the upcoming senatorial by-election. On Thursday, ODM Machakos county branch chairman Peter Mutuku announced they will rally their members to campaign for John Katuku and ensure he wins in the poll on March 18. On Friday, a statement from the party headquarters said that in the spirit of NASA and BBI, the ODM party has resolved to rally its support behind the Wiper Party candidate Agnes Kavindu. The party Director of Communications Philip Etale said that ODM has over the years enjoyed a cordial working relationship with the Wiper Party of Kenya. “The two parties have been partners and shared many ideologies. In the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), the ODM party and Wiper Party share the common position of a better Kenya, a United Kenya and a Prosperous Kenya. We were in CORD together and later on in NASA,” Etale said. Etale added that Kavindu played a major role in BBI, both as a member of the initial BBI Task Force and later served in the same capacity in the BBI Task Force. Mutuku had said that the decision to back the candidate from Governor Alfred Mutua’s party was reached during a special meeting. Mutuku said as a party they had met several times in their Machakos office and analysed all the candidates. “We have found a better replacement for Senator Boniface Kabaka and this is Katuku. We are proposing that Katuku be supported by all Machakos county residents,” he said. The governor had welcomed the endorsement, saying that the partnership will extend beyond by-elections.
