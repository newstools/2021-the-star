Several Kakamega county departments are being evacuated from a rented building after it developed cracks. The Public Works department has warned that the relocation from Kotecha Plaza should be treated as urgent as the building may collapse. The building has been rented by the county government and houses Procurement, Communication, Environment, ICT, Legal and Education departments. It also accommodates private offices. The county turned to private houses to accommodate its staff because of the shortage of working space. Public Works chief officer Patrick Likavo said an inspection of the building revealed that columns have developed cracks and foundation settlement is apparent with plaster cracks and tile skirting shifting. He said 5mm-wide cracks have developed and been increasing on the ground floor slab. The cracks have also appeared on the first-floor slab, running the entire length of the building. He blamed the cracks on the ongoing excavation of an adjacent plot where a building is being constructed. "Excavation works are adversely affecting the existing building as it is done to depths below the existing building's foundation, leaving it exposed and without appropriate ground support differential settlement of the building evident from the cracks on the floor," he said in his advisory dated January 28. "We hereby advise that the said Kotecha building be vacated with immediate effect until remedial action has been taken to counter this differential settlement." He said failure to remedy the exposed foundation may lead to a sudden shift, which will ultimately lead to the collapse of the building. "This collapse may come without any warning." The chief officer's advisory is copied to Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and his deputy Philip Kutima, county secretary Jacinta Odhiambo and executives Rodah Masaviru (Public Service) and Geoffrey Omulayi (Public Works).
