Two bodies – those of a man and a baby – were retrieved on Monday from flooded Lake Baringo after an overloaded speed boat capsized. The accident occurred on Saturday at 3.30pm. The water safety chairman blamed the accident on overloading and said the brakes were applied abruptly. Baringo South subcounty police commander Benjoliffe Munuve said the body of 30-year-old businessman Ken Komen and one-and-a-half-year-old Cara Kipsang were retrieved on Monday morning. “The divers are still struggling to find the body of 15-year old Jill Akinyi, a Form 2 girl at Lake Bogoria Girls High School,” he said. Munuve said 12 people were on board, including family members on an expedition from Kampi Samaki town to Teddy Bear Hotel on Kokwa Island. He said divers from Lake Baringo assisted police to retrieve the bodies. Five victims were rescued immediately, four swam to safety but three were missing. Bogoria Girls High School principal Jean Ngaywa condoled with Jill's family. Lake Baringo Water Rescue and Safety International chairman Joshua Chepsergon blamed the accident on the weight of the vessel, saying it was overloaded. “The coxswain accidentally applied the emergency brakes sharply when he approached the island and then it scooped water, which made the boat capsize,” he said. Chepsergon said due to the waves, overwhelming water levels and darkness, the divers were unable to dive deep on Saturday evening. They resumed on Sunday morning. It was the latest in a number of accidents over the years; at least 11 people drowned. In 2004, the headmaster of Nairobi's Hospital Hill School and seven parents died when their boat capsized after a storm. The same year, a tour guide drowned during a swimming expedition at Devil's Island. An academic tour turned tragic in 2011 after two students of Comboni Youth Polytechnic in Gilgil drowned. One of the students slipped and fell into the swollen lake, his colleague drowned while attempting to rescue him. (Edited by V. Graham)
