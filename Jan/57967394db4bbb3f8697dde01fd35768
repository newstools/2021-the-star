Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations are pursuing a Meru bodaboda rider who is reported to have defiled an eight-year-old girl. The detectives say the unidentified suspect on Wednesday evening offered the girl a ride to her home at Baibariu in Igembe South, but along the way diverted to his house where he committed the act. He later dropped the helpless minor near their homestead before taking off into hiding. The detectives say as the victim receives medical attention at a local hospital, a manhunt for the suspected paedophile has been launched. This is just a day after a Kenya Defence Forces soldier was arrested after he defiled a minor. The officer based in Embakasi was arrested after he was involved in an accident while with the minor. DCI boss George Kinoti said the man had promised to drive the 16-year-old Form One girl to school in Othaya, but instead made a detour to a lodging in Kiriaini and defiled her before proceeding with the journey. "However, he instead sped towards Nyahururu, past the intended destination. His sins were laid bare minutes later when his vehicle was involved in a road mishap at Muringato at around 6 pm," Kinoti said. On questioning on what he was doing with a schoolgirl who happens to be his relative, Kinoti said the man couldn’t explain the presence of the minor satisfactorily prompting his arrest. "Disturbingly, the suspect is a relative to the minor and had promised to take her to school, a promise which didn’t see the light of day," he said. Kinoti said officers escorted the minor to Nyeri County Referral Hospital for the necessary medical tests to be conducted. The man is meanwhile placed in custody pending arraignment.
