A Nairobi-based businessman Mutuku Muoka is the latest millionaire in town after scooping the first SportPesa mid-week Jackpot since the company resumed business three months ago. The Chelsea fan was presented with his Sh12,444, 454 over the weekend after correctly predicting the outcome of 13 select matches in the mid-week jackpot pool. The 45-year-old car spare parts dealer from Embakasi in Nairobi narrated how the life-changing midnight call from the firm rendered him insomniac for the rest of the night. “When I got the call in the middle of the night from the SportPesa Customer Care, I could not believe what I was hearing. It was impossible to sleep after that,” he recounts. Mutuku, locally  supports 18-time Kenya Premier League champions Gor Mahia FC but admitted to be a close follower of  former champions Tusker FC. He also conceded to be a fan of former Shield Cup holders Kariobangi Sharks and is hopeful that local football can slowly become as passionately followed as the likes of the English Premier League. Mutuku first started playing in 2016 but became more hopeful and optimistic after witnessing Samuel Abisai win SportPesa’s Mega Jackpot worth a whopping Sh 221 million in May 2017.
