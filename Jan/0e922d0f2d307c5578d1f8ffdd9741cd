National beach volleyball team  coach  Patrick Owino is optimistic his players will resume training in the next fortnight  ahead of the Tokyo Olympics qualifiers. This comes after the Federation of International Volleyball — FIVB — accepted Kenya's appeal for the repeat of the second round of the qualifiers. "Given the time frame that we have, I believe  two weeks will be enough for us to reorganise ourselves to return to training subject to availability of funds and approval by the executive," Owino said. The continental qualifiers are tipped to take place either in March or early April in Nigeria. Kenya were due to travel to Nigeria in March last year for the qualifiers but Covid-19 travel restrictions imposed on teams made it difficult. Kenya had already selected a team of four players, namely, Gaudencia Makokha, Prackcides Agala, Phosca Kasisi and Yvonne Wavinya but Owino plans to add at least two more to increase the competition in training. Owino is also hopeful that the men's team will be given the green light to return to training soon. "Our fingers are crossed and we hope our men's team will also be given the go-ahead by FIVB so that we can resume preps. Ideally, we need three or four players to challenge those selected in training," he said. Owino, who works with coach Sammy Mulinge, said their immediate focus will be to sharpen the tactics and endurance of the players. He described the return of the Kenya Volleyball Federation League as a big boost to his team's chances as most of his players have been training with their respective clubs. "In terms of fitness, we've not lost much. I am happy most of our players have been training and playing. At least, we are starting from somewhere. The task at hand will be to perfect on the tactics and endurance which are the most crucial components of the game," Owino observed.
