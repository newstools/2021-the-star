The Employment and Labour Relations court has stopped the vetting of Nyamira county CECs nominated by Governor Amos Nyaribo that was scheduled for January 21. Former Health CEC Douglas Bosire acquired a conservatory order restraining Nyaribo from sacking him and four others. "The court is pleased to issue a conservatory order in form of an injunction restraining the first, second and third respondents from interfering with service contracts of the applicant/ petitioner," read part of the order by Justice Hellen Wasilwa of the High Court in Kericho. Last week, the court barred Nyamira county from vetting Deputy Governor nominee James Gesami. Justice Maureen Onyango temporarily stopped Nyaribo from presenting the name of the Gesami to the County Assembly for vetting. “The respondents are hereby restrained from presenting the name of the Gesami to the County Assembly for vetting pending inter-parties hearing of the application,” the order read. In the case Vincent Omao has moved to court seeking to stop Gesami’s nomination as the next deputy governor. Omao has sued Nyaribo, County Secretary, Clerk of the County Assembly and the Speaker. Gesami was nominated two weeks ago by Nyaribo who took over office following the death of Governor John Nyangarama. In the papers, he argues that Gesami's appointment was done without due diligence.
