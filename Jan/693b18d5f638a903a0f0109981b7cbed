Awasi Onjiko MCA Maurice Ngeta has reported a threat to his life to police in Kisumu. Ngeta says unknown people have sought him at his rural home and in the city, without saying who they were or what they wanted from him. He suspects they want to harm him. On Wednesday, he told police officers that two people went to his rural homestead, blocked his driver’s way and asked them where he was. “They were at my gate and when the driver saw them, they asked where the owner of the house was. My driver asked them what they wanted, who they were,” Ngeta said. The persons said they were from Nairobi but on further interrogation by the driver left the home. Ngeta said the same people had earlier visited his Kisumu city residence but could not locate his house. "In my house in town, they visited but they stopped at the gates to ask the security guards my house number. He did not provide the information. I was notified of the incident since I was not around. I decided to report," he told the media. He recorded statements both at Awasi and Kisumu police stations. He was given OB 75/7/01/2020 in Kisumu and OB 11/02/01/2021 in Awasi police station. The police said they will investigate who the people are, why they have been trailing Ngeta and their motive. "I have people who depend on me from family to my constituents hence cannot take anything for granted," Ngeta said. The MCA said in politics, you might not know whether you have crossed one's line or not. But if it’s the case, he’s open to dialogue.  (edited by o. owino)
