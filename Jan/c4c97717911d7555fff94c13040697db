Former Senator David Musila has promised to prioritise education and help needy students if he is elected Kitui governor next year. He said he is concerned that students from needy backgrounds fail to complete their education because of lack of money. “I will copy the model used by the Murang’a governor. Every year, 1,000 learners are offered full education bursaries to ensure that they do not drop out due to lack of school fees,” Musila told the Star on the phone on Saturday. The former legislator said for a county to develop, people must be educated to provide the needed expertise and manpower. He said through the David Musila Foundation, he spent Sh13 million to finance the education of 51 poor learners, all of whom graduated from university last December. “Today, I take pride and pleasure in the fact that I have helped 51 Kitui children attain university degrees through magnanimity. I will not stop there, with God’s help will still embark on assisting another batch of students,” said Musila. "That is the trend I want to further if elected governor to ensure that more children benefit from county funds.” Musila, who was Kitui senator between 2013 and 2017, is seeking to dethrone Governor Charity Ngilu in the 2022 General Election.
