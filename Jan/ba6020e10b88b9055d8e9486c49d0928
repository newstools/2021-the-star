Homeboyz presenter Lotan Salapei quit a well-paying job in Rwanda for a slot in the radio world. Speaking to Word Is, Lotan said he was working in a human rights organisation in Rwanda as the country’s lead for the organisation. "I always wanted to be in media and in December 2017, I quit my job, came back to Kenya in 2018, and started finding a way to be on air. Homeboyz took a chance on me and I’m here." He describes the experience at the radio station as phenomenal after G-Money gave him the chance. "I started as a sports presenter on Fan Zone once a week, and now I've grown to do a drive show and I still maintain my sports portfolio. It's been a proper adventure and growth." Lotan, who doubles up as an MC, has also experienced the wrath of social media users in his line of work. "I was coming from a very chill background, where nobody cared, and now the public is criticising me," he said. "I remember there are days I would call John Rabar and ask him if I am really good, and he’d give me the affirmation that I am doing good." He added that one day, someone sent him a WhatsApp message, saying he will never make it in media. "I assumed it was a guy and I didn’t text back and he never texted again, so I didn’t know who it was." The presenter co-hosts alongside Kerry Martin. Previously, the Boyz Club also included Mike Wachira, who moved to Smooth FM. "These two gentlemen are phenomenal, they took me up and believed in me. They saw the ambition and the drive. They are the ones who pushed for me to be in the show." Being on the drive show and meeting incredible people are some of the highlights. "I had the opportunity to interview Rio Ferdinand when he came to Kenya, so I take that like something I will never forget, just talking about football." Apart from good music, Lotan describes their show as one where the listener will experience a lot of ‘gentleman gossip’. He hopes to venture into other media platforms like TV.
