President Uhuru Kenyatta has once again admitted to corruption within his government while defending the cost of BBI. Speaking to Kikuyu stations on Monday morning, Uhuru insinuated that the country was losing up to Sh2 billion a day to corruption. "I don't know where people got the cost of Sh2 billion or Sh14 billion. But even so, these people are on a daily basis stealing that Sh2 billion you hear people talking about. These people are deceitful," Uhuru said. The President had been asked whether he knew how much the proposed BBI referendum would cost. He noted that it was too early to talk about cost yet the document was still with IEBC for signature verification before going to the county assemblies. "However, if the proposals will help us give more money to the grassroots, the cost of the referendum should not be an issue," Uhuru said. There has been debate on whether the country should spend money on a referendum at this time. The IEBC had put the cost of the referendum at Sh14 billion but ODM leader Raila Odinga dismissed it and said the cost should not be more than Sh2 billion. More to follow...
