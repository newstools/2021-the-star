A herdsman was killed and over 300 heads of cattle stolen in a raid by suspected armed rustlers at Haro Halakhe Yayo watering point in Saku constituency in Marsabit county on Friday. Marsabit county police commander Samuel Mutunga said one person was killed and another sustained injuries during the incident. Mutunga said that the unknown number of raiders drove away over 300 heads of cattle from what investigations indicate to be a counterattack. The county police commander said security personnel were deployed to the affected area to restore order and pursue the attackers. He added that helicopters were dispatched to the area to help in tracking down the raiders and recover the stolen animals. The incident comes barely a day after two other incidents were reported in Turbi area in the neighbouring North Horr constituency. During the attack pitting two pastoralist communities, 155 goats and about 167 heads of cattle were stolen. One person was injured during the counterattacks and was rushed to hospital for treatment where he is responding well to treatment. Mutunga urged the political leadership and other peace building stakeholders in the county to strive to build understanding and peaceful coexistence among local communities. According to the county police commander, the two sides of the aggressive groups have accepted the existence of illicit firearms which were being used in perpetuating cattle rustling. Marsabit Central deputy county commissioner Patrick Muriira said the government was working on modalities to stem the menace as it portends great risk to security in the area. He said that efforts to sensitise the local communities against engaging in the vice and the need to share available grazing resources amicably, especially during this time of drought, were on course.
