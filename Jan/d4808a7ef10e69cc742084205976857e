Tragedy hit different homes when five children died on New Year’s eve after falling into a 20-foot septic tank filled in Githurai area, Ruiru, Kiambu County. The children aged between three and seven were playing within a compound of an abandoned construction site when a shrub caved in, officials said. They were from different homes. They drowned. Ruiru Police boss Phineas Ringera said, “They were playing on top of an abandoned shrub within an abandoned construction of a site. The weak shrub caved in when they were playing and inside there was water so they drowned." It was a somber mood in the village as news of the deaths spread Thursday night. The bodies were moved to a local mortuary. Police said they are investigating the incident for a possible action on the owners of the site.
