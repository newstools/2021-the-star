Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has joined residents to condole with his deputy Moses Mulomi following the death of his son Dan Were Okhoba. Were was a graduate student at the Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology. He was pursuing a master’s degree in computer engineering.

He said Were was an industrious person whose contribution to the development of the computer engineering sector will be remembered by many who knew him. Ojaamong said Were’s zeal and decision to pursue a master’s degree in computer engineering was a pointer to his determination to push the industry to greater heights. Mulomi said: “It’s hard to accept the sudden death of my son Engineer Dan Were Okhoba. A gap has been created in my family as the lifeless body of my son lies at Kakamega Funeral Parlour.” (edited by o. owino)
