Fire destroyed a section of the building housing Khetia's supermarket in Eldoret causing damage estimated at millions of shillings. The third and fourth floors of the building located in Eldoret CBD were razed early on Sunday morning and fire fighters from the Uasin Gishu county took four hours to put the fire out. Uasin Gishu county commander Ayub Gitonga said, "We have not established the cause of the fire but there were no injuries. we only have damage to property whose value we are yet to establish." Gitonga said it took long to put out the fire because the mattresses fuelled the fire. The supermarket has been shut temporarily. Police have also sealed off the supermarket to stop looters from accessing the building. The supermarket is currently the largest in the North Rift region with more than eight branches.
