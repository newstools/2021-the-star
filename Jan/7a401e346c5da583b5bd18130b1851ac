Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya on Monday launched construction of the Poster-Wayani-Golini cabro road at Tsimba-Golini ward in Matuga subcounty. The road will cost Sh36 million and take six months to complete. Mvurya said construction is part of the county's effort to upgrade towns to municipalities. “We want to have massive development in rural areas and transform them into cities,” he said. Mvurya said Kinango and Lunga Lunga subcounties will soon be promoted to municipalities. Last year, a municipal board was inaugurated following the elevation of Diani and Kwale to municipalities. The municipal board is supposed to spruce up town beautification, monitor revenue collection, improve water, electricity supply and manage other towns' activities. Mvurya said the improved roads would meet the standard requirement of urban development. He said the improved areas will contain proper drainage systems and parking lots installed with street lights. The governor said they have signed an agreement with the World Bank to strengthen the Marere water supply system for Sh426 million. “We are going to solve the water problem issue because a contractor is already on the ground working on expanding the Marere pumping system,” he said. The improved water pumping system will address the perennial water shortages in Golini, Tumaini and increase county water connectivity. The governor said he aims to open up businesses activities in Kwale and attract more tourists and investors. Kwale has been ranked more than five times as the best tourist destination in Kenya. Mvurya said several schools, roads and health centres would be built for the towns to attain the municipality status. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
