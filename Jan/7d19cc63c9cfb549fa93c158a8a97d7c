US-based actress Christine Wawira is planning to open birth centres in Kenya to help decrease the infant mortality rate. In a statement sent to Word Is during her visit to Kenya for her mother's burial, the actress noted she has a passion for maternal health and even became a certified Hypnobabies (childbirth hypnosis) instructor back in 2019. Her goal is to bring Hypnobabies to Kenya along with building birth centres with waterbirth options (a birth in which the mother spends the final stages of labour in a birthing pool). Christine realised her acting talent in secondary school and has since featured in various stage plays, TV shows, movies, commercials and music videos. Christine lost her mother after she suffered a cardiac arrest during the Christmas season. In her memory, Christine, her sister and cousin got matching tattoos.
