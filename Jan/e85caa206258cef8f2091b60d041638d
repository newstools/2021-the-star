The office of the Director of Criminal Investigations has issued a warning to students involved in criminal activities while in school. Cautioning students on Monday, DCI said that it is archiving and consolidating charges that may be preferred against students involved in crime. “Let each student be informed that it will automatically be reflected on the Police Clearance Certificate (Certificate of Good Conduct) when such student will apply for one.” It continued that, “This will be a permanent criminal mark that will bar many students from achieving their goals as no employer of worth will dare employ such characters.” The crimes mentioned include armed and unpeaceful demonstrations, arson, drugs, cyberbullying, assault of any degree, drunkenness, or any reported crime of any kind. Parents, guardians, teachers as well as religious leaders have been asked to take note and advise students in primary, secondary, colleges, and universities against engaging in crime. This comes amid rising cases of suspected arson that have been reported in some schools since learning resumed this year. In Embu, fires haves been reported in three schools under suspicious circumstances. The dormitory in Kiambere Mixed Secondary in Mbeere South went up in flames early morning barely 10 hours after a dorm at Kirimari Secondary in Embu town was torched. On Thursday, a Gikuyari Secondary dormitory in Mbeere North was also gutted by fire.
