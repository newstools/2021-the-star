The Kisumu county government will spend Sh400 million to repair roads that were damaged by the recent floods, Governor Anyang Nyong'o has said. Nyong’o said about 99 roads within the county were destroyed by floods last year and earmarked for rehabilitation. He said the rehabilitation works on the affected roads had started. The work is being undertaken by the newly constituted county roads maintenance team. Speaking when he flagged off the distribution of Covid-19 prevention equipment to support schools that were affected by floods in Nyando sub-county, he said they are committed to controlling the destructive nature of flooding that seasonally destroys both schools and homes. Among the schools that will benefit from the donation through the county departments of education and special programmes include Odienya, Oseth, Ogenya primary and Ombaka secondary school. The institutions will get handwashing stations, thermoguns, sanitisers, masks, bar soap, water purifiers, water buckets and jerricans. Several schools in Nyando were hard hit by the ravaging floods which resulted in the relocation of learners in about six institutions. The schools were rendered uninhabitable to learners after reopening last week. “There is need for having permanent measures to mitigate the effects of flooding especially in Nyando area where destruction had been experienced,” Nyong'o said. The proposed construction of the Sh 32 billion Koru-Soin multipurpose dam will help to mitigate the perennial flooding downstream river Nyando upon completion. Nyong'o said floods had continually caused suffering to the residents as well as property destruction. “We must therefore not only initiate temporary measures of dealing with the effects of the floods such as repairing damaged roads but find a lasting solution to the recurrent problem,” he said.
