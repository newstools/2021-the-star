It was a cold, cloudy morning as I sat quietly at the Hyena dam, waiting and watching to see what bird action there was. Suddenly, a movement caught my attention, the profile of a large crocodile was cruising across the water and was swimming towards me. Being a master of stealth, the reptile reached the bank without being noticed, and then when the birds became aware, the peaceful scene erupted into an orchestra of panic sounds, and many of them were in a major flap, due to this “croc shock”. However, the croc seemed to have a different motive, as it moved out of the water and onto the bank in the hope of getting some daylight warmth. I have seen this crocodile at the Hyena dam on a number of occasions. What impressed me was the fact that Hyena dam is quite a few kilometres from the Athi River, where most crocodiles can be found. I ask myself questions, like, "Why go so far inland? How did this crocodile sense there was a dam here?" However, irrespective of how and why, it seems to be thriving, even with a few hippos as well. Crocodiles are found in many places in Africa. There are three species, of which the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is the largest living for about 80 years, and growing up to about 5m (with a record 6.5m specimen weighing 1,090kg). Ninety-nine per cent of the crocodile offspring are eaten in the first year of life by large fish, monitor lizards, herons and... adult crocodiles. A female crocodile lays 20-80 eggs. They have a reputation of being very stealthy hunters, waiting patiently beneath the water for their unsuspecting prey, then striking at lightning speed to kill. Watch out for these reptiles next time you visit the Nairobi park, you might enjoy a “croc shock” moment! For more information you can link to the following website www.kws.go.ke
