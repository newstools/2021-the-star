Former Churchill show comedian Prof. Hamo says that he and Jemutai are still going strong and that he still spends nights at her residence in Kitengela. In an interview with Jalang'o TV, Hamo said; "Do you think it would have been easy for me to go back to Jemutai if I had responded to her complaint publicly? That's disrespectful. We have our arguments in private." He added that he is still "the man of the house" and still considers his relationship with Jemutai as solid. "I told her that I also have dirt on her that I could easily post on social media but I asked her how that would be beneficial to us. Would we have been able to sit together after that and talk? "I love her very much," Hamo stated, which prompted Jalang'o to ask: "Umerudi ukalala kwake nyumbani kweli?" Prof Hamo answered: "Kwake ama kwangu? Hata ukitoroka na wewe bado ndio unalipa hiyo nyumba..." The two will be going live today to clear the air about their public lovers' spat. "It's a series because one of the things that have helped me is being an honest man... Before I put up that apology, I had gone home and spoken to my first wife. I admitted that I was in the wrong but I pleaded with her for the sake of the children I have with Jemutai. "You know, these children don't care where you go or which famous people you've met, at the end of the day they just want to be fed so be honest. And it's freeing. Now I'm a very free man. You should see me playing with my children at Kitengela." Prof Hamo went on to note that as a result of his honesty he got more job opportunities.
