In December 2021, the Nairobi National Park will celebrate 75 years. Since Mervyn Cowie was the first warden, many caring people have been involved in ensuring the park remains intact. Some battles have been won, and some lost. We do not live in a perfect world, and the park is constantly being threatened. The creatures within the park do communicate, but they cannot speak as we do. The park needs many more caring people who will “be a voice for the creatures who cannot speak!” There are many ways to get involved, especially by joining FoNNaP. The Friends of Nairobi National Park (FoNNaP) has been a powerful voice for the creatures for many years in partnership with the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). A priceless treasure is a treasure so valuable and unique that no money or any item of value can replace it. The Latin words “Custos Naturae” translate into English as Guardian of Nature, we need to protect the God-given natural resources. In Genesis 1 vs 28  “ So God created man…, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” Are we really the Guardians of Nature that we are meant to be? Pray we all start to really care about nature! …. decide now what the future will be? A sad loss?  or hopefully a legacy to be proud of in 2046? Pray many people have a change of heart and become a powerful voice for the creatures who cannot speak!
