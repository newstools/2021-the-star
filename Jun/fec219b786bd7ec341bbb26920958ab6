This was confirmed by the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation Flemming Møller Mortensen who visited UNICEF supply, which is the largest humanitarian warehouse in the world that delivers life-saving supplies Mortensen said that UNICEF will support the donation on logistics.

Danish Ambassador to Kenya Mette Knudsen had said the fund would enable county governments to improve access to quality healthcare in level three facilities countrywide.
