More than 22,000 bright but needy students in Homa Bay will benefit from Sh100 million bursaries courtesy of the county government. Governor Cyprian Awiti together with his deputy Hamilton Orata, county secretary Isaiah Ogwe and finance executive Nicholas K’Oriko said the funds will benefit students in secondary schools and colleges. Awiti said the funds will be distributed to the county’s 40 wards, each receiving Sh2.5 million. Speaking during disbursement of the funds, Awiti said education is the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor. “Educating children is an investment which creates an enabling environment for future production. They will know how to tackle challenges in life in future and address poverty,” Awiti said. On Friday, Awiti said his administration is looking for partners who can support the kitty to sustain the programme. Orata said the funds will help many parents whose family income has been affected by the Covid-19 outbreak in the county. “The Covid-19 pandemic has made life unbearable to parents and many of them cannot pay school fees. We hope the funds will be a sigh of relief to them,” Orata said. He expressed optimism that distribution of the funds will enhance schools' cash flow and impact on academic performance. Orata said the funds will enhance retention of children in schools. “Students will focus on studies instead of being sent home for fees. The funds will improve the purchasing power of schools and their academic performance,” he said. School heads were asked utilise the money well and not send students home for fees. Ogwe warned county government officials against collusion to shortchange any student who should benefit from the money. “All our needy students who applied for the bursary in their respective wards will get it. We have put measures in place to ensure the applicants benefit without compromise,” Ogwe said. Edited by Henry Makori
