The government has received a consignment of 350,000 Covid-19 vaccines of AstraZeneca this evening at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The consignment is a donation from the Danish government and is expected to boost the government’s vaccination exercise after the complaints that there was a shortage of the jab. The doses will boost the second inoculation exercise that commenced late last month. They will be delivered by Unicef to the Health Ministry before being distributed to regional vaccine stores for further distribution to the counties. They will be administered to those who have already got the first dose, with healthcare workers prioritised. Data from the Health Ministry show that 186,966 Kenyans have received their second dose, of which 51,400 are healthcare workers, 50,902 are people aged 58 years and above, 21,434 are teachers, 13,600 security officers, and 49,630 from the rest of members of the public. On the other hand, 994,622 people have been reached with the vaccine. The donation was made early this month by the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation Flemming Møller Mortensen when he visited UNICEF supply, which is the largest humanitarian warehouse in the world that delivers life-saving supplies Mortensen had said that UNICEF will support the donation on logistics.
