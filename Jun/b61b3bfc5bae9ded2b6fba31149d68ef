With Kenyan music evolving daily, radio presenter Maina Kageni feels it's time Kenya artistes took action. According to Maina, it's time the artists came together and created a hall of fame. Speaking on Nameless's show 'This love' he said: "You need to open a hall of fame. A building where people can pay 200 bob and get in and learn about Kenyan music. Thatâ€™s the only way people can learn about Kenyan music." Maina commended Nameless for leading a drama-free life. "I do not know of two people who have impacted Kenyan music as Nameless and Wahu have." Maina and the Mathenges have been longtime friends. He was the MC at their wedding, which took place in Naivasha 16 years ago.
