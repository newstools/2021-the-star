Two families in Narok North and Transmara East subcounties have been thrown into mourning after a teenage boy and an old woman committed suicide in unclear circumstances. In the first incident, the body of 18-year-old Brian Samaito Mateu was on Friday found hanging on a rope in his parentsâ€™ house at Nkokolani village in Narok North subcounty. Narok county police commander Kizito Mutoro said it was not clear what drove the teenager who just cleared Form 4 to commit suicide. He was a student at Masikonte Secondary School on the outskirts of Narok town and was waiting to join college. Mutoro said police had launched investigations into the matter to find out the motive behind the death. The body of the deceased was moved to Narok County Referral Hospital mortuary pending a postmortem and further investigation into the incident. In the second incident, the body of 77-year-old Juliana Cheptanui Sirwa was found hanging on a rope in her house in Kabuson village in Mogor, Transmara East subcounty, the same day. Sirwa is said to have been ailing from throat cancer for some time, but the matter is still under investigation. The body of the deceased was moved to Kapkatet Hospital mortuary in Kericho county pending postmortem and further investigation into the incident.
