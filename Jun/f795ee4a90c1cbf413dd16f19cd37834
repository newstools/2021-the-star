Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations have rescued four year old, Liam Ngucwa Mwangi, who was kidnapped from his grandparents' home in Murang'a. According to DCI, Liam, who was rescued Monday afternoon, was found at a house in Naivasha after five days of looking for him. "The 4-year-old boy has since been reunited with his parents, who couldn’t hide their joy holding the little angel, after five days of tears and anguish," DCI said. Liam's parents had in an online appeal asked Kenyans to share any information they might have about the whereabouts of their son, who went missing on June 2, 2021. They later learnt that their son had last been seen in Thika, in the company of one Charles King’ori alias Delvin Maina who was their houseboy. DCI stated that the rescue mission was executed by detectives from the Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau together with their Special Service Unit counterparts. The detectives, however, said that Liam's abductors escaped shortly before he was rescued. "Detectives are pursuing baby Liam’s captors," DCI added.
