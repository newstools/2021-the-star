The state is building a Sh8 billion dam at Bute in Wajir county. It is one of five mega dams planned for volatile areas where communities clash over over pasture and water. The dams are expected to foster peace while providing clean and sufficient water to all citizens. Other dams will be built in Galmagala in Fafi constituency, Isiolo, Marsabit and Mandera. Speaking in Bute, Wajir North on Sunday during the launch of Eresteno Mega Water, Regional development CS Aden Mohamed said the national government is keen on fostering peace among clans in the Eastern and Northeastern regions. He said the dams will bring together clans that live in the targeted areas and different communities will be able to share water and learn they are not so different. “This is about reducing inter-clan tensions and clashes over water and pasture. These mega dams have a higher capacity that can serve all the communities for a long period,” Aden said. The dams will also be used for crop irrigation, which will boost production and provide income for locals. He said the dams are means of water catchment measures especially during rainy seasons when water is wasted. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
