Evans Kipruto will have a three-pronged attack when he competes at the national World Under 20 trials at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani starting on Thursday. Kipruto, of West Pokot County, will be seeking tickets to the August 17 to 22 global showpiece in triple jump, long jump and 400m hurdles. Kipruto is among 68 North Rift region athletes headed t Nairobi for the trials, where he hopes to repeat his heroics in the regional pre-trials held at the Lornah Kiplagat Sports Academy in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet County two weeks ago. “My prayer is that I make the cut in the three disciplines. I have been training well with my coach, Edward Moti, with the hope that I will excel in all the events,” said Kipruto from Siyoi Athletics Training Camp. He said he has been using the long break occasioned by the coronavirus to train hard. "My dream is to fly the Kenyan flag high,” said Kipruto. He will be joined by training mates Reuben Mosin (5,000m), Lydia Cheruiyot (3,000m), Franklin Kiptoo (3,000m) and Shalyne Chemtai (3,000m steeplechase). Moti tipped his athletes for greatness at the trails and, eventually, at the World U20 event. "The training we have had has improved the level of fitness of these athletes and I am confident they will make Team Kenya. Remember we had our trials in Iten, which is in high altitude compared to other regions and that gives us an advantage,” said Moti. He added that despite other areas like Kapsabet and Kericho being the higher altitude, they cannot match that of Iten.
