President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday evening led Kenyans in mourning former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo. In his message, the Head of State described Midiwo as a forthright, brave and straight forward leader who spoke his mind at all times. "I have received the sad news of the passing away of my friend, the Honorable Jakoyo Midiwo with shock and disbelief," Uhuru said. He went on to say that Midiwo was a consummate debater in Parliament and he articulated matters of national importance and defended the wellbeing of Kenyans. Uhuru prayed to God to grant Midiwo's family grace and fortitude during this difficult time. Midiwo served as Gem MP for three terms between 2002 and 2017 on National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) parties respectively. Deputy President William Ruto said Midiwo was a fearless and outspoken leader and his exceptional service to the people will be missed. ODM leader Raila Odinga described Midiwo as a man who served with passion and always kept his word "First elected MP in 2002, Jakoyo Midiwo served the people of Gem with passion for 3 terms. An astute debater, a man of his word and honor, Jakoyo had a rare ability to work across the aisle and got along with members from across the political divide," Raila tweeted.
