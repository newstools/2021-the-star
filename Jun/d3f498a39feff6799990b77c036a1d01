Morocco defeated Mozambique in the men's category to also book their place at the Olympics. Olympics Kenya second vice president Waithaka Kioni, who is also the Kenya Volleyball Federation president, was thrilled to see Kenya qualify to the quadrennial event. "I am really proud of the performance by our players. Personally, I am thrilled that we will have another volleyball team in Tokyo because Malkia Strikers had already booked their ticket," he said. "Let the team return before we see what happens. Definitely, they will hit a bubble residential training camp and at the same time, we will try to organise friendly matches for them to sharpen their skills," said Kioni. In addition, Kioni, who is also Kenya's Chef de Mission for Tokyo Games, urged corporates to invest in sports to enable athletes fulfil their potential. "I call upon the government and corporates to invest in sports. There's a good sign and big potential in our players that they can be harnessed to be the best in the right environment," he remarked. Kenya knocked out Morocco 2-1 in the semifinal. They also overpowered Mozambique in the quarter final. The men's team lost in the quarters.
