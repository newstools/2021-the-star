Baze, the new mobile-first, video-on-demand service, has released 'Mission To Rescue', an action drama featuring local actors. The drama will be available exclusively on Baze for three months before being unveiled anywhere else. Speaking to Word Is, director Gilbert Lukalia said he was out of his body when directing the action drama. "We get jobs each passing day but it's not every day your job scares you. And I think those are the best jobs," he said. "It felt like the world was conspiring with Foxton Media to raise me so high up and naturally, I was afraid of a fall. That made me cautious." He explained that this was one of the best works he has recently done. "You need some good amount of fear so you don't get comfortable. The backing from Foxton, crew and cast made it lighter. The first challenge a director has is sharing their vision with the crew and cast. You can only go so far without their backing." Lukalia said once he was in tune and understood the magnitude of what was his responsibility, the rest was fun. "My wish is that MTR is watched and loved by as many Kenyans as possible. Young and old. We need that backing as an industry. And trust. I want the Kenyan audience and investors to trust the Kenyan filmmaker." Media Pros Africa CEO Wangeci Murage said they intend to take the film to an audience that may not have access to Baze through mobile screenings as their main objective is to deliver it to as many audiences as possible.
