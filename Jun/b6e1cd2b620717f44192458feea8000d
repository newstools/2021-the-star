Public Service Cabinet Secretary Margaret Kobia said the far-reaching austerity measures and budget cuts as well as the Covid-19 pandemic affected the performance of MDAs. "That notwithstanding, the MDAs have continued to deploy performance contracting as one of the performance management tools in achieving their annual performance targets and ultimately their respective mandates," she said. The report shows out of the 21 ministries, State House, OP, Office of the DP and that of the AG, none attained 'Excellent' performance grade or 'Very Good.

Overall, the report noted a decline in the performance of ministries, agencies and state departments in the 2019-20 financial year with the average composite score falling from 3.3816 to 3.3920. Comparatively, four state corporations that posted poor results in the 2018/2019 financial year continue to perform dismally and are still among the bottom ten in the 2019/2020 period. They include the East African Portland Cement that had a composite score of 4.0575, South Nyanza Sugar limited (4.0698), Tana Water Works Development Agency (4.0763) and Chemelil Sugar which posted a score of 4.3195.

According to the report, the non-approval for contractor master list duty, VAT exemption for key infrastructural projects under the core mandate and special user licences by Kenya Forestry Services affected the rating of the Tana Water Works Development Agency. Regarding East Africa Portland Cement, the poor performance in the core mandate criteria was largely due to inadequate working capital, deteriorating plant health, and constrained clinker and cement production. The best performing functional category were public universities that posted 3.0312 points followed by financial (3.0962), Regulatory (3.1518), Regional Development Authorities (3.1605), Service (3.2033), Training and Research (3.2130) with commercial and manufacturing institutions coming last with 3.5166 points.

The report shows that the TVET outshone Teachers' Colleges and National Polytechnics across the country. This was attributed to enhanced government capitation and sponsorship by the Higher Loans Board. Kaimosi Teachers college was the last one with 3.8633 points followed by Gatanga Technical and Vocational College(3.8956), Okame Technical and Vocational College (3.9010), Konoin Technical Training Institute(3.9573), Narok Teachers Training College (3.9734), Muranga Technical Training Institute (3.9853), David Wambui technical (4.0831) and Weru Technical and Vocational College completed the bottom eight list with (4.0867) points. Nachu technical and Vocational College came number nine last with 4.2216 points followed by Nuu technical and vocational college at 4.3410 points. According to the report, government ministries and agencies failed to meet the legal requirement of having at least 30 per cent of all tenders allocated to the youth, women and people living with disabilities. Of the tenders worth Sh67.47 billion available across the government the special category was only allocated contracts valued at Sh45.96 billion in the 2019/2020 financial year. This means that ministries and state agencies fell short of the legal requirement in the allocation of tenders by 31.88 per cent. The 2019/2020 was the sixth cycle of continuous implementation of performance contracting in the public service as part of the government's reform initiatives to improve service delivery. A performance contract is a management tool used to prioritise MDAs annual undertaking and for measuring performance against agreed performance targets. It is a freely negotiated performance agreement between the government and the various government ministries, agencies and departments with clear commitments and obligations. This ensures efficient service delivery to the public by holding public officers to account for their results. In the 2019/2020 financial year, a total of 366 MDAs signed and implemented performance contracts-comprising 21 ministries, State House, Office of the deputy president, AG's office, 223 state corporations and 119 tertiary institutions. Before the commencement of the moderation exercise which was done in November last year, the MDGAs were required to conduct a self-evaluation using process using the automated performance evaluation platform. The platform was based on 16th performance contracting guidelines. This was then followed by the moderation exercise by an external technical team of professionals from the PSPMMU supported by officers drawn from public service departments. The five performance grades fall on a 5-point scale of between a raw/ composite score of 1 and 5 where a score of 1 is the best while 5 is the worst. Achievement levels were then categorised into excellent, very good, good, fair and poor against target of 30 per cent.
