After climbing to third position on the log, Kisumu All Stars coach Salim Babu says his team is back into the promotion mix. Babu, who spoke after his team humbled visiting 18th placed Modern Coast Rangers 3-0 at Moi Stadium, Kisumu remained upbeat that the team will return to the top tier league one season after they were relegated. “We want to keep fighting and remain among the top three teams. We have a huge chance to return to the Kenya Premier League although the league is very competitive,” said Babu. He added: “We have picked up the rhythm at the right time because we have recorded three consecutive wins. In the first leg, we didn’t play well but I’m happy with the way the boys are playing currently.” The Kisumu County government-sponsored team leapfrogged Shabana to third spot on goal difference with both teams tied on 34 points. Shabana played to a 1-1 draw against Kenya Police at Camp Toyoyo grounds in Nairobi as coach Robert Ojienda maintained his unbeaten record since he joined the team. The team has recorded two draws and two wins. The Glamour Boys will entertain Silibwet Leons on Wednesday at Migori Stadium. Modern Coast travelled to Kisumu with only 12 players with assistant coach Ahmed Said confirming that six of their players are out with injuries. “Despite the fact that we only had one substitute, we played well but it was a bad  day in the office. We want to win our next three games so that can we move from relegation zone. It is very possible,” he said. The strugglers suffered a huge blow after their coach Ahmed Mohammed quit. In other matches played on Saturday, APS Bomet edged Soy United 1-0 while Murang’a Seal defeated Coast Stima 3-1 at St Sebastian Park in Murang’a. Silibwet and Nairobi Stima shared the spoils after playing to a 1-1 draw at Bomet Stadium as Sony Sugar defeated Mwatate United 2-1.
