The arrival of seven-time World Rally Championship champion Sebastien Ogier has sparked excitement among rally lovers across the country. Toyota Gazoo Racing’s Ogier and his Hyundai Motorsport counterpart Otter Tanak jetted into town on Sunday night ahead of the WRC Safari Rally which starts this week. Both drivers flew into the country with private jets in time for pre-event activity, which starts on Monday. This will be first time for the two world rally drivers  on African soil. Ogier currently leads the WRC log with an 11-point cushion over Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville of Belgium. Tanak, the 2019 WRC champion, has not had a good season with his retirement earlier in the month. The Toyota lineup has one of the most meticulous rally gladiators in Ogier. They also have a very reliable wingman with championship ability in Elfyn Evans. Tänak has indicated that he will follow a different strategy for the remainder of the FIA World Rally Championship season after retiring from the lead for the second time in consecutive rallies in Italy. The Estonian lies 57 points adrift of championship leader Sébastien Ogier with seven of the 12 rounds remaining. He lost a comfortable lead at Rally Italia Sardegna on Saturday when he hit a rock and ripped the right rear wheel from his Hyundai i20. It followed a similar disappointment last month when a shattered suspension forced him out of Vodafone Rally de Portugal while heading for victory.
