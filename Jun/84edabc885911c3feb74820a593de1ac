Fashion and lifestyle blogger Sharon Mundia alias 'This is Ess' has addressed lesbianism claims. In a Q and A session on Instagram, a fan asked Sharon if she has ever had a romantic involvement with a woman. Sharon responded that she has never been in a romantic relationship with a woman. "Do I think I could be? I don't think so. If you would have asked me 20 years ago, I would be like 'never', now I don't know," she said. "If I think of my significant other and what our future will be like, I think of a man next to me. But I think we should legalise it in Kenya. I wish people could be with and marry whoever they want to marry." The rumours started circulating immediately after she allegedly separated from her husband Lonina Leitepan. During the Q and A, she could not deny or confirm whether she is married.
