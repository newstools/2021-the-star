The Environment and Land Court has temporarily barred the Kenya Meat Commission from taking over the sheep and goat demonstration farm in Machakos county. The order issued on Thursday by Justice Oscar Angote will remain in force until June 30. Empakasi Oolera Trust on behalf of more than 2,000 Maasai community members sought to stop the government from occupying the land. They said it was their ancestral land. Justice Angote directed that the orders be served to Kenya Wildlife Services, the National Land Commission, the Attorney General, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and the Kenya Meat Commission. Empakasi Oolera Trust members claim the land is part of their ancestral property. KWS hived 1000 acres off the 2,000 acres of the demonstration farm which was handed over to them by President Uhuru Kenya earlier in the year. KWS later handed over the parcel to KMC which is now under the management of Kenya Defence Forces. KDF officers under Brigadier James Githaga moved into the land in Mavoko and started erecting a fence around it.
