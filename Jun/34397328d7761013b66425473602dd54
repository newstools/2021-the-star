Deceased Businessman Chris Kirubi was a born again Christian, Rachel Ruto, the wife of deputy president William Ruto has revealed. Speaking during the funeral service of the businessman in Karen, Nairobi, Rachel said Kirubi was a staunch believer who had a place for God in his life endeavours. "He was born again, he loved the Lord," she said. Rachel revealed that in the run-up to the 2017 elections when she led a prayer caravan around the country to pray for the nation, Chris Kirubi was a significant financial supporter of the initiative. She said that in one particular instance during the initiative when they were starved of money, she approached Teresia Wairimu the head of the Faith Evangelistic Ministry for advice, and who connected her with Kirubi. "When we went around the country to pray for the country, I approached my spiritual authority Teresia Wairimu who said she'd approach Kirubi," Rachel said. So they organized a dinner at the church to raise funds for the prayer event that was to culminate at Uhuru Park. Kirubi would attend the dinner and asked how much was needed for the food to be served. "He gave the whole money that was needed to fund the Uhuru park meeting. And it was in millions. He gave the entire amount. He was a giver," she added. Rachel said Kirubi also joined them for the prayer gathering at Uhuru Park. Kirubi's burial is set for Saturday at his farm in Thika. The burial ceremony will begin at 11 am. Kirubi, 80, died on June 14, 2021, at his home after a long battle with cancer diagnosed in 2016.
