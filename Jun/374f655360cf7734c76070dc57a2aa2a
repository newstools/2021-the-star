Kenyan health facilities registered a surprising surge in new onset diabetes cases last year, data from the Ministry of Health reveal. The surge is unusual because the registered incidence of nearly all other diseases dropped last year, as Kenyans avoided hospitals due to the lockdown and fear of infection with Covid-19. But figures collected from all public health facilities through the Kenya Health Information System show more people were diagnosed with diabetes every month last year, compared to 2019 and 2018 when there were no movement restrictions. “Throughout 2020, most services were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, including utilisation of general outpatient services for both adults and children. It affected child health services, HIV services as well as cancer screening services,” said Agatha Olago, head of primary health services and family medicine at the Ministry of Health. Researchers are now probing if Covid-19 infection triggered the onset of diabetes in a substantial number of patients. The data, presented by Dr Olago, show new diabetes cases were highest in July when 52,795 people were diagnosed with the disease, compared to 44,184 in 2019 and 38,202 in 2018. Although cases of diabetes have been rising every year, the spike last year was unexpected because all outpatient visits were substantially low last year compared to 2019 and 2018. For instance, only 5.3 million Kenyans visited health facilities last year compared to eight  million in 2019 and 6.6 million in 2018. “Nationally, total outpatient department visits for January to September 2020 declined by 27 per cent compared to similar period in 2019,” Dr Olago said. Hospital deliveries were also consistently lower last year while the new cases of tuberculosis and HIV were also lower compared to 2019 and 2018. In total, 533,214 new diabetes cases were registered last year, compared to 504,333 in 2019 and 441,839 in 2018. The ministry did not desegregate the cases into Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. People who have diabetes either cannot produce insulin (usually known as Type 1 diabetes), or cannot properly use the insulin the pancreas produces (also known as Type 2 diabetes). Research in other parts of the world shows Covid-19 can impair the body's insulin-producing cells, leading to diabetes. In November 2020, a global analysis published in the journal 'Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism', found that as many as 14.4 per cent of people who were hospitalised with severe Covid-19 also developed diabetes. The study showed SARS-Cov-2 can infect the pancreas and shut down insulin production, causing Type 1 diabetes. For Type 2 diabetes, acute inflammation and/or steroid treatment may finally push a Covid-19 survivor into having diabetes. It is also possible some people may already have been genetically at risk with mild stressors such as being overweight. Some high-dose steroids commonly used to treat Covid-19 also play a role in Type 2 diabetes development. The findings emphasise that for some people, defeating Covid-19 is only the beginning. More complications may also arise depending on which parts of the body have been damaged by the viral infection. (Edited by V. Graham)
