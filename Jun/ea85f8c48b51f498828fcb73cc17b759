Kenya’s WRC3 ace Onkar Rai was the fastest local in shakedown after returning his R5 VW Polo in the 11th spot. But the Kabras Sugar Racing ace caused quite a stir when he edged Rally2 star, Martin Prokop, by a cool 10.3 seconds. Prokop timed 44.17.9 in his second attempt on the 5.4km Loldia shakedown. Onkar’s elder sibling Tejveer Rai was the third-fastest Kenyan in 13th while multiple Safari Champion Carl Tundo came in 14. FIA World Rally Championship leader Sébastien Ogier was quickest in Wednesday afternoon’s shakedown after he edged Toyota Gazoo Racing teammate, Elfyn Evans of Great Britain, in a thrilling showdown. The seven-time reigning world champion posted the quickest time in his third and final run through the 5.40km Loldia shakedown. Thierry Neuville in his Hyundai i20 Coupe was  1.1 secs slower than Ogier. Loldia was representative of the punishing broken roads that competitors will face over the next few days and Dani Sordo was the fastest out of the blocks to set the quickest time in the opening run in his i20. Ogier moved top of the standings in the second pass and lowered his benchmark time further in his fourth and final run. Evans and Neuville soared up the order in their last attempt to fill the top three places.  SHAKEDOWN RESULTS 1. Sébastien Ogier (Toyota Yaris) 03min 42.6sec 2. Elfyn Evans (Toyota Yaris) +0.1sec 3.
