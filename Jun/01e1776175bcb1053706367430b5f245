After recording five wins on the trot, Nairobi City Stars head coach Sanjin Alagic says he is ready to battle with Wazito at Ruaraka grounds on Wednesday. “Every upcoming match will be even tougher so any type of relaxing is forbidden. We have an amazing run and I want to continue with the victories, match by match, starting from the next one, Wazito. We are ready,” said the tactician. Wazito lost 2-1 against AFC Leopards in their weekend fixture. He was however quick to point out that with back-to-back games, celebrations are already over and it’s time to focus on the next set of games. “We don’t have time to enjoy our success. Matches are played every 3-5 days, so we must stay focused and dedicated to our job,” he told the club’s website. “I congratulate my players and coaches for new victory, a fifth consecutive win which is a new record for NCS. I am pleased things are going good,” said Sanjin who is a Uefa pro license holder. Last week, City Stars edged Nzoia Sugar 1-0 to move to fifth on the log with 32 points. During the game against Nzoia, assistant John Amboko took charge of the game in the absence of Alagic who travelled to his homeland Bosnia for his second Covid-19 vaccination jab. Previously, City Stars’ best record of wins – four on the trot – was back in 2006, 2008, and 2012, under coaches Robert Matano, John Bobby Ogola, and Gideon Ochieng, in that order.
