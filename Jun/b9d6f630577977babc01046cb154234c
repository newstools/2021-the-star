Two chiefs and three assistant chiefs have been arrested in Kajulu Mamboleo for erecting illegal roadblocks to enforce the curfew. The administrators were accompanied by vigilante groups who were armed with crude weapons alleged to be extorting money from members of the public. Their arrest comes after complaints by various boda boda operators on harassment in the hands of the administrators. However, on Thursday night around 9 pm, Nyanza Regional Police Commander Karanja Muiruri laid a trap for the administrators. Karanja was being driven in a civilian number plate vehicle. However, when he reached the roadblock placed by the administrators, he was stopped and harassed by the chiefs. He then identified himself to them and later called other officers who managed to arrest the five as the youths who accompanied them escaped into the night. "It's the work of the police to mount roadblocks and in case of a multi-agency team then they must be accompanied by police officers and not vigilante groups". The five were locked up at Kondele police station and released on a free bond. They're later set to appear before Regional Commissioner Magu Mutindika and County Commissioner Josephine Ouko. Residents of Manyatta and Nyalenda had also complained of harrasment by the administrators who normally erects illegal roadblocks in the slums.
