Our opponents in the Confederation of African Football  tournament might punish us severely if we don't rectify our mistakes in good time, Vihiga Queens' head coach Alex Alumira has warned his players. Alumira says he is currently refining his players in speed and drilling them in the best attacking and defending techniques. “I'm scared if my girls continue with this habit, then our opponents at Caf tournament will capitalise on the situation to cripple us,” Alumira said. He said there is quick need to change the style of play to make it difficult for their opponents. Alumira warned he might drop players who can't adopt to his new methods fast enough. Among the players that have been urged to adjust to new techniques include Topister Situma, Jentrixs Shikangwa and Lilian Awour among others. This comes as Vihiga Queens prepare to meet winners between Gaspo Women and Wadadia next weekend on the penultimate round of the FKF WPL tournament at the ASK Grounds in Nakuru. “I have realised most teams have mastered  our playing strategies and we risk being punished,” Alumira said. “We need to shift to a new style that will help us put our opponents  at our own control,” he added.
