Kisumu county government has expressed concerns that some residents are still flouting protocols put in place to contain the spread of Covid-19. This comes as cases continue to rise amidst an alarming increase in fatality figures. According to the health department, in the last 24 hours, there has been 142 new confirmed cases, bringing the number of cumulative cases to 6,681. Health executive Boaz Nyunya said some residents are still boarding overloaded matatus and failing to properly wear face masks and some are still gathering in groups with total disregard for the protocols. “It has come to our attention that barely a day after the national government issued additional containment measures through the Ministry of Health, some residents continue to flout these protocols,” he said. Nyunya said in bars and restaurants, some people still do not keep their distance from one another while others hide along the corridors to continue drinking after the 7 pm closure deadline. “We wish to caution that the crackdown by the County Multi-Agency will spare no one, save for those performing essential services duties,” he said Nyunya reiterated that all funerals must be conducted within 72 hours of confirmation of death. “We want to thank relatives who are continuing to comply with this directive. We are however waiting for court orders to dispose of unclaimed bodies, some of which have been in the morgues for very long periods,” he said. Nyunya said that worshipping places must remain closed to the public until further notice, among other containment measures, announced on Thursday. “We wish to appeal to the people of Kisumu to join the fight against Covad-19. With self-discipline and patriotism, we will flatten the curve in less than two weeks and eventually kick the virus out of Kisumu,” he said. “Kindly be your brother and sister’s keeper. Don’t shy away from telling them to properly wear their masks.”  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
