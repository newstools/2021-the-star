DCI detectives have arrested the main suspect linked to the kidnapping of a child in Murang'a. Charles King’ori alias Delvin Maina was arrested on Monday afternoon following a dramatic chase in the streets of Naivasha town. He is suspected of kidnapping four-year-old, Liam Ngucwa Mwangi, from his grandparents on June 2, 2021. Baby Liam was rescued Monday afternoon at a house in Naivasha after five days of looking for him. The DCI said in a statement via Twitter that the suspect was nabbed as he tried to escape a few hours after the baby he had kidnapped was rescued. DCI sleuths received a tip from residents of the suspects' whereabouts prompting them to move swiftly. "So desperate were his attempts to escape justice, that he had visited a salon in the town to have his hair braided to conceal his identity," the DCI said. Detectives pounced on him as he escaped on a getaway motorbike putting him in cuffs. Liam's parents had in an online appeal asked Kenyans to share any information they might have about the whereabouts of their son. They later learnt that their son had last been seen in Thika, in the company of one Charles King’ori alias Delvin Maina who was their houseboy. DCI stated that the rescue mission was executed by detectives from the Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau together with their Special Service Unit counterparts.
