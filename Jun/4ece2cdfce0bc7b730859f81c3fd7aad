French-Canadian Nigerian singer Töme has dropped a single titled 'Nana'. Speaking about the song, she said, “I think it’s safe to say that when it comes to boys/men and relationships, you need to make sure you know what you want and if they don’t like it; well, you can’t hear them.” The first song from a forthcoming project, 'Nana', signals Töme operating in a pocket of sound that’s fundamentally attuned to her unique strengths. She makes a tribute to her individualism over an ebbing instrumental, packing in lyrical choices that urge her to move on despite what might be happening in her life at the moment. Töme will be visiting Kenya early next month for a listening party and media tour to popularise her single and upcoming EP.
