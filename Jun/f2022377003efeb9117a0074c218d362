A three judge bench has struck out sections of Lawyer Charles Kanjama BBI appeal. Attorney General Kihara Kariuki had strongly opposed the appeal by Kanjama on grounds that he was not a party to the high court case. Justices Hannah Okwengu, Patrick Kiage and Francis Tuyoitt struck out a section of his appeal where he was affirming part of the high court judgement that stopped the BBI process. However, the judges have only retained part of his appeal that faulted the five-judge bench decision, which failed to give reasons for declining to enjoin him in the BBI case at the high court. The court has directed him to file and serve a new memorandum of appeal that's limited to the issue of joinder at the high court. The court noted that the high court had rejected his application so he cannot argue the same issues before the court of appeal. "The high court in it's ruling rejected his application and he cannot now purport to go round the ruling by canvassing the issues that he intended to before the high court, but which he was unable to do due to the order refusing to have him enjoined," the court said. The court says it will handle his appeal after it concludes hearing the BBI appeal scheduled to kick off tomorrow. "Kanjama's appeal shall not be consolidated with other appeals arising from the judgement of May 13 but shall be heard back to back with the appeals by the seven-judge bench on July 2," the court ruled.
