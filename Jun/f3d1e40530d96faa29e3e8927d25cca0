Even without engaging in full gear, Kenya are still marching to victory in seemingly routine fashion at the on-going seventh edition  of the Kwibuka Twenty20 Women’s International Tournament at Gahanga Stadium in Kigali. Their display in Match Day Three’s morning match against Nigeria justified as much after they cantered to an 8-wicket win with 11 balls to spare. Nigeria captain Samantha Agazuma won the toss and declared that a target of 130 runs would be a good total to set after she opted to have a bat. Blessing Etim (34 runs off 33 balls) and Salome Sunday with an unbeaten 45-ball 33 were the bedrock of their side’s innings, helping Nigeria inch close to their desired total and must have been feeling confident enough after ending on 108 runs for 5 wickets in 20 overs. But Kenya’s opening batters slowly and steadily quietened the vocal West Africans as they raced to 71 runs before the first wicket of Veronicah Abuga (33 runs off 36 balls) fell in the 13th over. Abuga got a rousing applause from both dugouts and the few spectators who were in the pavilion after she struck the first six of the tournament straight to the sightscreen during her entertaining cameo of power-hitting. From then on, it was a victory procession for Kenya, who started their run chase with already five runs on board, after the West Africans were penalised for consistently running on the pitch during the first innings. Player of the Match Queentor Abel, who had earlier returned figures of 1 for 19 in 4 overs, was the only other wicket to fall at 92 runs in 16.1 overs. The 23-year-old flourished with a 53-ball 40 runs knock that comprised two boundaries. Captain Margaret Banja, who had claimed two wickets with the new ball, got her team over the finish line with an unbeaten 12 runs alongside wicket-keeper-cum-batsman Sharon Juma (10 runs not out) as Kenya safely reached home on 109 runs for 2 wickets in 18.1 overs.
