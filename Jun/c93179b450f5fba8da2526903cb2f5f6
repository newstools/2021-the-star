Lexxy Yung from Sailors Gang says he recently lost his first-born child under unclear circumstances. Taking to social media, Lexxy recounted the day his wife experienced labour pains and was admitted to one of the hospitals in Limuru. He was told to go home, leaving his wife behind. "So next day nikakam happy, prepared and all, but I was awaited by bad news," he said. "Nothing can bring him back, ata pesa ngapi. But this was Not God's will but someone kiherehere, an kufanya kazi bila kuwa na umakini na bila knowledge ya daktari... I will seek justice for my baby boy coz hakukufa ivo, ni mtu alimuua." Lexxy also posted a video of his girlfriend when she was expectant, saying the hospital took away his dream of being a father. "Justice for my son is all am seeking."
