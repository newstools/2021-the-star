A group of widows living with HIV in Migori county are fighting stigma, misinformation and championing healthy living. Ng’eyo Ngima Support Group in Awendo subcounty was started in 2017 with only six women, all widows affected by the virus. It has grown to 30 members. Group's director Rose Ashley said on Tuesday she started the group after realising most women were suffering from stigma, especially after the death of their husbands. She added that misinformation is still high in the county for those living with HIV/Aids. “Most are shunned by their families and find it hard to pick their anti-retroviral drugs from hospitals. We formed this support group to encourage each other,” Ashley said. She said they counsel each other and encourage members to visit the hospital in case of any opportunistic diseases. They started with a merry-go-round and ensured all members were registered with the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). “We also have kitchen gardens and encourage fruit and chicken farming to not only boost our income, but also to improve the family nutrition,” member Mary Dek said. The two spoke in Awendo town during a meeting with members. According to the National HIV and Aids Stigma and Discrimination Index, Migori stigma rate is at 35 per cent, with the highest stigma at 60 per cent recorded in Garissa, Mandera and Wajir counties. Kenya has an estimated 1.6 million people living with HIV. Of that number, about 650,000 people are accessing antiretroviral treatment, the report indicated. It further showed that close to 101,560 new HIV infections occur annually. “As the country grapples with how to reduce the number of new infections, stigma and discrimination continue to disrupt and discourage access to HIV education and treatment, care and support services,” the report said.
