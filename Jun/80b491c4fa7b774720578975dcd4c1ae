United Democratic Alliance chairman Johnstone Muthama had to sneak out of a UDA meeting in Mombasa after police disrupted it. Acting on a tip-off, Muthama quietly left the Terrace Villas Resort while UDA Secretary-General Veronica Maina was speaking. Soon after, a contingent of about 20 armed police officers led by Nyali subcounty police commander Daniel Masaba arrived and ordered everybody out. The grassroots mobilization meeting was attended by aspirants and supporters of the Deputy President William Ruto-linked party from across the six counties at the Coast. The aspirants and supporters were forced to leave the venue but some insisted on partaking of the food that had been prepared for them. They were seen carrying plates of boiled eggs, bread, yams, beans and tea. "This food has been paid for. They should let us eat. It must not go to waste," complained some of the UDA supporters. Masaba said they were not informed of the meeting. "No gathering of people like this is allowed, especially political meeting," said Masaba. He said they will arrest the manager of the premises. Earlier, Muthama had said there are no leadership structures at the regional level so no one should brand themselves as party officials. "We are yet to conduct elections so anyone is welcome," said Muthama. He said Ruto is firmly behind the party. "Do not worry about Ruto now. He knows what he is doing," said Muthama. Party Secretary-General Veronica Maina said this is the second time their meeting is being disrupted following another one in Meru. "We were less than 100 people and it was a private meeting. Why would the police break it up?" said Maina. Muthama said despite the challenges they are facing from the government, UDA is getting stronger. Salim Tenge Mohamed said political meetings are being disrupted selectively. "There was a huge meeting in Kisumu the other day. There was no social distancing. But only UDA is being targeted," said Tenge.
