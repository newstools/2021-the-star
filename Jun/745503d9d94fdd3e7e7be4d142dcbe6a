England are not bothered by the "noise" from outside the camp ahead of Tuesday's final Euro 2020 Group D match against the Czech Republic as they focus their efforts on qualifying for the knockout rounds, forward Raheem Sterling said. England kicked off their campaign with a 1-0 win over 2018 World Cup finalists Croatia but were held to a goalless draw by Scotland in the second match. Gareth Southgate's team are second in their group on four points, behind the Czechs on goal difference, and a draw would see both teams advance regardless of the outcome of the game between Croatia and Scotland, who are both on one point. "I do feel there's a bit of an over-reaction on the whole," Sterling told British media on Sunday. "I just feel there's more of a panic on the outside than inside the building. "I don't see anyone in the camp that feels any pressure or feels hard done by. As much as we can inside the building the best thing we can do is focus on the training field, focus on what's being doing inside. "We really shouldn't be looking what the papers are saying, what pundits are saying. That's something we need to take for the rest of this tournament, the more you listen to outside noise, the more it can affect you." Meanwhile, England's Phil Foden said his team mates have agreed to copy his dyed blond hairstyle if they win the European Championship. Foden caused a stir on social media before the tournament when he shared a picture of him dyeing his short black hair, just as former England great Paul Gascoigne did for Euro '96. The 21-year-old said he had persuaded his team mates to copy the hairstyle if they capture their first major trophy in 55 years. "If we win it, I told the team they had to get the same haircut as me!" Foden told TalkSport. "They all agreed so hopefully, if we win it, you will see everyone with the same haircut. "I think Romania did it where they all had the same haircut so if we win it, I would make everyone get the same haircut."
