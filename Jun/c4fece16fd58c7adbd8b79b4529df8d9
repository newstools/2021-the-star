The Kenya Red Cross Society has promised to continue partnering with state and non-state actors to address water shortage in Northeastern. KRC secretary general Asha Mohamed said they aim to provide safe water for domestic and livestock use. She spoke on Wednesday in Balambala subcounty during an inspection tour of Sankuri water project. Sankuri water project was funded by the International Committee of the Red Cross through KRC. It supplies water to residents, learning institutions and an AP camp. “There are two elevated tanks that hold 100,000 litres of water to serve 90 per cent of the population. If put into good use, the water will help end the perennial shortages and save women and children the time they use to go and fetch water,” Asha said. She said Red Cross was working with the county and national governments, and other stakeholders to provide water for irrigation to ensure food security and end conflicts. “We are enacted as an auxiliary to both national and county governments. Ours is to compliment their efforts. We just don’t come up with an intervention that doesn’t fit into the framework the county has. And if it's missing, then we bring it to the table for discussion,” she said. Asha said they have new projects they intend to implement in Modogashe subcounty. “Water is one of the key areas of intervention to prevent diseases. As we talk about Covid-19, we know how important water is,” she said. Resident Nadhifa Abdirashid thanked the organisation, saying many lives have been lost through crocodile attacks as people fetch water from the river. Earlier in the day, Asha led her team in donating drugs and masks to Garissa county. Edited by A.N
