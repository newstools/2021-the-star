The Directorate of Immigration has embarked on the implementation of the 60-day Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) program for Citizenship and Permanent Residence services. The initiative was launched on May 26 this year by the Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to expedite the processing and issuance of Citizenship and Permanent Residence. Immigration embarked on the exercise on June 2 and will run for two months, ending on July 31. Immigration Director Alexander Muteshi said that during the period, the department will focus on clearing the backlog and establishing the framework for speedy processing and issuance of the documents. The services that will be offered include regaining Kenyan Citizenship, Citizenship for Spouses (children, widows, and widowers of Kenya citizens), Citizenship for Lawfully Residents (investors), and Permanent Residence for spouses and children of Kenya citizens. Also, permanent residence for Ex-Kenyans and Permanent Residence for Lawfully Residence will be expedited. Applicants have been asked to contact the directorate through its contacts or visit RRI Customer Relationship Desk at Nyayo House, Nairobi. Kenyans in the diaspora have also been asked to present their applications to the nearest mission abroad for onward transmission to Nairobi. During the launch, Matiang’i said that more than 25,000 applications are pending at the Immigration offices, and asked the Attorney General to simplify the application process. The CS had said that the Government of Kenya is keen to reunite families as most of these Kenyans have to apply for visas and cannot engage in gainful employment unless they are issued with permits and passes. Matiang’i added that the government is aware that Kenyans lost their citizenship when the new Constitution came into effect and are eager to regain Kenya Citizenship, which is their birthright.
