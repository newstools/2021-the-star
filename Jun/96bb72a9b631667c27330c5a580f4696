Ngoizi, popularly known as “Kachali”, played a key role in helping her team and her fellow players were convinced to vote for her as the most outstanding player in March. “This award is not just for me but for the entire team. All the good performances that made me win this award were because of my teammates and the technical bench led by the coach,” Ngoizi said during the awarding ceremony at Kayole Calvary Grounds. “This is a very big achievement for me and my team. I need to keep moving and better my performances so that I can be among the finalists at the end of the season KEFWA Gala Awards,” added an elated Ngoizi, who received the award on her birthday.
