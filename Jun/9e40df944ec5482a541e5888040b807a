The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union has raised concerns over lack of enough Covid-19 vaccines for second jabs. In a statement on Tuesday, the doctors' union said that there is an "extreme shortage" despite receiving communication to go for the second doses at designated health facilities. The union went on to ask for clear communication on the matter from the Ministry of Health. "Dear @MOH_Kenya, there seems to be a communication breakdown regarding the second dose of the vaccine. There's extreme shortage," KMPDU tweeted. Adding that, "We are getting messages to go get the vaccine done at various facilities, however when we get there, the jab is not available, talks in every facility." This comes a few weeks after Health CS Mutahi Kagwe announced that the duration between the first and second dose had been revised by up to four weeks. "While considering the global shortages, the Ministry of Health has revised the duration between the administration of the first dose and the second dose from eight to 12 weeks," Kagwe said. The MOH later announced that the second round of vaccinations against Covid-19 would begin in June. So far, 37,918 health workers have been fully vaccinated. As at Monday, June 14, only 128, 744 people in Kenya have received the second dose of the Covid vaccine. "Of these, 37,918 are Health Workers, others 33,926, those aged above 58 years 34,269, Teachers 13,673 while 8,958 Security Officers have also received their second dose," MOH said. During the reading of the budget, last week, Treasury CS Ukur Yatani said that he had allocated Sh121.1 to the health sector and of these amount, Sh14.3 billion will be used for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines and other related expenditures in the next financial year.
