Kenya Film Commission has established Reel County Film Festival under the 'My County My Story' programme aimed at growing the local film industry. The Reel County Film Festival will provide a platform for local filmmakers to come together and share knowledge and capacities. This will help to make a stronger impact on the cultural, social and economic development of audio-visual products in the counties. Filmmakers within Kenyaâ€™s 47 counties will come together and create content that promotes the cultural, social and economic activities of their respective counties. The content created by the different counties will tell stories, feature prominent people (historical or current) and fascinating locations of the counties. The content created will then be offered for selection into the Reel County Film Festival. The content up for the selection for the festival includes feature films, short films, documentaries and animation. Once the content is received, a jury of five members drawn from the commission and the film industry will shortlist the submissions from the various categories and identify the top productions that will be screened during the festival. The virtual screenings will take place on the Kenya Film Commission YouTube channel. Each day will feature screenings of the selected productions. The commission will award the producers of the content a screening fee of Sh70,000. At the end of the screening of each production, a panel comprising of film professionals will hold film review discussions. Interested people can submit content via WeTransfer to the email: submissions@filmingkenya.com from May 24 to June 11, 2021
