The vote rich Mt Kenya West and East   might be headed for political split in 2022, Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi has said. He said Mt Kenya East region will not support a kingpin from Mt Kenya West. Kiraitu said Mt Kenya East has been absent from the  political limelight for some time. He said it might field a presidential candidate in 2022. Kiraitu made the statement after a meeting at his residence in Kiigene, South Imenti, on Saturday in response to a meeting by Mt Kenya West leaders in Nyeri. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has been at the center of the political bickering and 2022 might be the first time the vote rich region goes to the presidential polls divided. Meru Senator Mithika Linturi, who attended the meeting, also said the region will not allow itself to be duped. "We will not accept to be eaten from the pockets like groundnuts; it's time for the pot to be broken and everybody go his own way," Linturi said. Three Mt Kenya East governors, Martin  Wambora (Embu), Muthomi Njuki (Tharaka Nithi) and Kiraitu have pledged to  support Muturi. Kiraitu said it is selfish for  Mt Kenya West to imagine they can field another presidential candidate. “We supported Jomo Kenyatta, Mwai Kibaki and now President Uhuru Kenyatta; it’s their time to support us. I think Kenya's ethnic architecture  should be looked into. There are many communities. It is not fair for Mt Kenya West to reject our spokesman so that they can replace him with theirs,” Kiraitu said. Several leaders who attended the meeting echoed the sentiments by the Meru governor. Linturi said Mt Kenya East will forge a partnership with those from the West if they support Muturi who was recently coronated by elders.
