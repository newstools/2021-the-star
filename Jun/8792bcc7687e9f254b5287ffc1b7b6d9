Former majority leader Aden Duale has supported calls for all aspirants to obtain a degree ahead of 2022 elections. "This is the law unless amended by Parliament and hence if interested in vying for any elective position in 2022, please ensure that you have a degree from a university recognized in Kenya," he said in a statement on Monday. Duale said whereas there are arguments that leaders are born, even born leaders require the academic ability to execute their legislative, oversight and representative roles effectively. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati had said that aspirants for all the six political seats must have at least one degree to be eligible to vie next year. Article 99(1) of the Constitution provides that a person shall be eligible for election if the person satisfies education requirements prescribed by an Act of Parliament. Section 22 of the Elections Act No.24 of 2011 provides for the  academic requirements for election to the position of the President, Governor, Members of Parliament and Members of County Assemblies. Duale further said the functions that a Member of Parliament is required to perform demands that one also possesses academic qualifications that can equip an MP to effectively perform these functions. He mentioned that the legislative role of a Member of Parliament requires one to examine challenges facing the constituents and transplant them into a Bill that abides by the Constitution and stands the scrutiny of courts. He also said the oversight role of an MP requires one to among other things examine and scrutinize public accounts and expenditures and hold public officers accountable by questioning their use of power and resources allocated to them. "Thirdly, the budget making process is an intricate process that requires MPs to examine  allocations made to state organs and realign them where necessary to promote the economic and social development of the constituencies," he added.
