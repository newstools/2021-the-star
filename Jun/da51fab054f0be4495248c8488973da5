Athletics Kenya (AK) North-Eastern region chairman Abdullahi Salat is optimistic that his sprints team will perform well at the national Under-20 trials to be held at Kasarani stadium next week. The region conducted its pre-trials a week ago at the North Eastern Technical Training College ahead of the national trials next week. AK will use the trials to select a team to represent the country at the re-scheduled World Under 20 Championships to be held in Nairobi in August. Salat said the region has good sprinters who have been consistent in their career progress. Owing to hot conditions in the North-Eastern region, long-distance running pre-trials were never held. “We have invested in sprints and we are praying that some of them will make it to the Kenya team for Under-20 Championships. We had good pre-trials but we did not host the 3,000m steeplechase, 3000m, and 5,000m due to the harsh weather conditions,” said Salat. He said their predicaments had everything to do with marginalization from sports development and lack of support from the relevant authorities. “As we speak now, no athlete from across the world can come and train from here. To produce a team from this region, we heavily depend on junior athletes but we have no much competition like other regions that have infrastructure and support from the government,” added Salat. He added that they are building a legacy in athletics and coming up with training programs. Team manager Ahmed Said said they selected three athletes in each competing category to expose them to the rest of the country. “We are ready as a region to challenge our opponents. Even if we come from the lowland, they may face some challenges at the high altitude in Nairobi but the support will be great for us,” said Said.
