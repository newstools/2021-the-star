Residents of Nyakach in Kisumu county have criticised Kenya Power for constant outages. Former Kisumu land executive Vincent Kodera said the frequent outages have caused locals and the business community huge losses. “We cannot store food in fridges in our homes and business premises because of rampant outages,” he said on Monday. The most affected areas include the recently upgraded town of Katito, Sondu and Nyabondo. Others are Pap Onditi, the subcounty headquarters. Kodera, who wants to replace Nyakach MP Aduma Owuor, said residents have been suffering, with little being done by the power company. The outages have seen an increase of insecurity and loss of businesses in the subcounty, he said. “Electricity is a very important aspect in life and our people have been suffering in the hands of Kenya Power,” Kodera said. “We pay for power and we don’t get power. Our people cannot get meaningful work.” The parliamentary hopeful noted that business enterprises have massively been affected since they cannot pump water into their premises and store food. “If we cannot have reliable power supply like other regions, then we will stop paying for power. We are running at a loss,” Kodera said. He demanded that the affected families and traders be compensated for the period they have been facing outages. “It is either we get constant power supply or we are compensated for the losses we have incurred. We are taxpayers like other Kenyans,” Kodera said. But Western Kenya regional manager Sarah Wapekhulu said they had not received the complaints. “Such complaints have not come to our attention. Anybody with complaints should log in to *977# to enable Kenya Power to detect the problem,” she said. Wapekhulu said she will liaise with her team on the ground to find out the exact problem.
