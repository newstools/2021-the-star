An American national was on Friday charged in a Nairobi court with beating a police officer and causing him serious injuries in Gigiri with the city. Zarnoch Stanley Theodore was charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki. According the charge sheet, the accused person committed the offence on June 2 at the entrance to the International Organisation for Immigration in Gigiri area. He assaulted police constable Kamau Muthoni with blows to his face, left arm and stepped on the officerâ€™s left leg. He denied the charges and pleaded for lenient bond terms. The police report says the accused person had accompanied his African partner who had an appointment at the organisation. The officer who was on duty had blocked him from accompanying the lady before an argument ensued which led to the assault. Court prosecutor James Kamande did not object to Theodore's release on bond. However, through his lawyer, the accused person told the court that he was assaulted by the officer. He told the court that he was not a flight risk and the magistrate directed that the matter be scheduled for June 16 for bond ruling.
