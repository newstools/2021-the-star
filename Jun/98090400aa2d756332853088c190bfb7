The Budget now includes Sh41 million for the annual pension and expenses of Musalia Mudavadi to which he is entitled as a former Vice President (see P6). The amount is substantial but covers the cost of staff, health insurance, transport, pension and other items. The allocation for former Vice President Moody Awori is approximately the same but former VP Musalia Mudavadi and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga get around Sh72 million annually. Raila and Musalia were also granted a gratuity of Sh200 million last year when government finally agreed to pay them their pension entitlement. Government initially refused to pay Raila and Kalonzo their benefits because, it was argued, neither had actually retired. They were still active politicians. The argument superficially appears to be a strong one but perhaps government gave up in 2020 for political reasons. But in all cases, the law must be followed. A precedent has been set that Raila and Kalonzo were entitled to a gratuity for delayed past entitlements. Therefore Musalia is also entitled to that same gratuity for unpaid pension since 20o2, even if he was only VP for two months.
