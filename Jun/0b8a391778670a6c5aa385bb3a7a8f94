Two men were charged in a Kibera court on Wednesday with threatening a pedestrian with daggers and robbing him of his phone near Lang'ata Hospital. Wilberforce Musila Okanga and Brian Omondi Ogutu denied any wrongdoing before senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua. They were released on a Sh500,000 bond each. The matter will be mentioned on June 28. They were accused that while in the company of other people not before court, they violently robbed Vincent Otiso Makori of his Sh18,000 Tecno Camon 5 phone on June 13. A police report says Makori was walking along Lang'ata Road near Lang'ata Hospital 10 minutes past 6pm when he saw four men a few meters ahead. Oblivious of what was awaiting him, he hurried, only for the four, including the two accused persons, to waylay him. They ordered him to surrender all his money and valuables. A tensed Makori hesitated and the accused, armed with a knife and daggers, threatened to harm him. They frisked him and took his phone before fleeing towards the Southern Bypass. At that moment, police on patrol passed by and Makori stopped them and narrated his ordeal. The officers pursued the suspects and arrested the duo as the others escaped.
