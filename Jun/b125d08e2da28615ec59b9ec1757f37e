Two people are feared dead after a light fixed-wing aircraft crashed at Vuria Hill in Wundanyi subcounty, Taita Taveta County. Coast Regional Police Commander Paul Ndambuki confirmed the Monday crash. He said rescue operations were undergoing. Locals said they heard a loud crash minutes after 8pm. Initial reports indicate that the plane with the two people onboard was enroute to Mombasa from Arusha. The iconic Vuria hill is the highest point in the Coast region sitting at 2,228 metres above sea level. It is a flight path from Arusha to Mombasa. Residents say the pilot might have experienced difficulties due to foggy weather. "There is a lot of fog and that might have caused the accident," Job Maghanga, a resident in Mwanda, said.
