Court of Appeal president Daniel Musinga has called for the appointment of the four judges meant to serve in the Appellate court omitted from the President Uhuru Kenyatta's gazette notice. Speaking during his swearing-in on Friday, Musinga said he will serve with diligence and provide servant leadership. "As former US President Jimmy Carter said, We must adjust to changing times but still hold to unchanging principles," he said. "I reiterate my commitment to diligently serve as the President of COA." Musinga said he will focus on the use of ICT to ensure real time hearing of cases efficiently during times of Covid-19. He said he will adopt an open door policy while discharging duties. Meanwhile, Chief Justice Martha Koome also called for the appointment of all six judges. "I'm a judge and I do not want to enter into any controversy but I'm duty bound to reiterate this position and call on (President) Uhuru to appoint the remaining six judges," she said. Koome said the Judiciary is in danger of capture from agencies as well as "people I shall not name". President Uhuru Kenyatta declined to gazette the names of six judges citing integrity issues. Aggrey Muchelule, George Odunga, Weldon Korir and Joel Ngugi were to serve in the Appellate court but their names were not gazetted. Uhuru gazetted the names of 34 judges.
