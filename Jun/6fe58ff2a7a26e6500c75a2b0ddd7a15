Kenya Police squandered an opportunity to ascend to the summit of the National Super League log following a one-all draw against a resurgent Mt. Kenya side. The law enforcers took the lead in the 23rd minute courtesy of John Ndirangu but Harry Gentle spoiled the party with an equaliser only six minutes to full-time. Police had to complete the job a man less after Reuben Juma was shown the door in the 70th minute following an infringement. Police remain second on the log with 36 points, one adrift of leaders Talanta. Meanwhile, Mt. Kenya's relegation worries continue as they are 17th with 18 points. Nairobi Stima shook of the underdogs' tag heading into the match to upset hosts Gusii United 3-1 at Migori Stadium. Rowland Makati broke the deadlock to put Stima ahead just six minutes into the encounter before Emmanuel Pala doubled the advantage in the 11th minute. Daniel Muhatia pulled one back for Gusii in the 27th minute but Benjamin Chaka's screamer in stoppage time was enough to put the results beyond doubt and seal maximum points for Stima. The results have taken Stima to 22 points, consequently dislodging Migori Youth from the 17th spot on the log. Gusii remain 14th with 24 points.
