I’ll be there to provide moral support," she added. "Our target is to retain the title. My girls are more than ready to go," added Alumira. He added he is spoilt of choice in selecting his squad for the encounter "I am having a headache in selecting the final squad because all the players have impressed the technical bench in the training," he added.
