The hiring of school buses for private events has been banned, Education CS George Magoha has said. Magoha announced the directive on Tuesday at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development where he released the Form One selection results for 2020 KCPE candidates. "...those seeking services of school buses must get authority from the Ministry. For the avoidance of doubt, school buses are to carry children using Covid-19 protocols, action is to be taken against anybody using the buses for any other reason,” he said. “We will not sit and allow people to misuse facilities of our children…We will give authorisation from Jogoo house, it does not matter if you are a government official.” In most cases, the school buses are hired by people going to funerals and weddings at a fee. This depends on the capacity of the vehicle. Taking people to funerals and not fumigating them subject teachers and children to Covid-19 disease. During the event, Magoha said candidates who sat the 2020 KCPE exams will report to secondary schools on August 2. In the placement, national schools will admit 36,254 students out of which 17,406 girls and 18,848 boys. However, the CS says the candidates do not get proper guidance in the selection of schools. "Poor selection guidance made many of the candidates miss their preferred selection," Magoha said. He called on headteachers and parents to help learners in selection process as the competition for top schools was competitive. "Big number of candidates do not receive guidance and directions when doing the selection. Like in western, everybody applied the same school..it's a total waste of time.. you cannot take the entire class to Alliance high school.. educate the children," he said. "I hope the confusion is not coming from someone. This boarders on carelessness and it made many candidates miss their preferred schools." Learners to text index number to 22263 to know schools they have been posted to.
