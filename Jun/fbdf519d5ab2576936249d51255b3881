The Nyanza North region World Under 20 pre-trials will be held on June 19, according to the regional chairman Joseph Ochieng. Ochieng said pre-trials will be staged at Kisumu National Polytechnic. “We have written to Kisumu Polytechnic requesting a venue. As you are aware, Moi Stadium track is in a bad shape and therefore, cannot host the event,” said Ochieng. Ochieng said he is hoping they will stage a successful event despite the Covid-19 challenges. “Initially, we had identified 61 athletes who camped at Sang’oro High School. Most of them have been locked out of this year’s event due to age,” noted Ochieng. Ochieng,  however, said they have already identified potential replacements who have been training for the pre-trials. “We decided to give the athletes time to prepare for the event. I’m sure by June  19th, they will be ready for the pre-trials,” added Ochieng. The World Athletics certified field judge further noted that they are focusing on sprints and field events. “Our area of specialization is in sprints and throws but we have few middle-distance runners. We want to select a strong squad to represent us at the national trials,” said Ochieng. He expressed confidence that Team Kenya will continue with their dominance in athletics at the international level. “Covid-19 challenges should not be an excuse because the pandemic affected the whole world. I’m confident once again, Kenya will emerge overall champions during the World Under-20 Championships in Nairobi in August,” he added. Already AK Southern Region and AK Central Rift staged their pre-trials in Machakos and Kapsabet, Nandi County respectively. Nyanza South will hold their pre-trials on June 11 at Kisii University. AK director of youth development Barnaba Korir said the federation is impressed with the calibre of talent taking part in the events.
