A woman has been charged with assaulting her husband by splashing hot water on his chest after she allegedly found him in their matrimonial bed with another woman. Phylis Nanjala Wekesa was Friday charged before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki. She denied the charges. The charge sheet says Nanjala committed the offence on May 30 in Kawangware Muslim area of Dagorreti subcounty within Nairobi. The accused person assaulted Lazarus Wanyonyi Milimo whom the police said was her husband. Police said the accused went to her house and found the man in bed with another woman. She demanded to know who the other woman was. But the man told her to pick her belongings and leave saying he was no longer interested in her, police said. An angry Nanjala then took hot water that was on the stove and splashed it on his chest. The man cried out for help. Their landlord was around and responded quickly, police said. The landlord called the man's cousin with whom they rushed him to hospital. He was later referred to Kenyatta National Hospital. Magistrate Mwaniki granted the woman Sh30,000 bond and directed the case be mentioned on July 17.  Edited by P.O
