Kiss FM co-host Jalang'o says a woman he dated while he was a hustler invited him for a date and dumped him. Narrating the story to Kamene during the Kiss FM breakfast show, Jalang'o said he was living in Mwiki then. "She asked me where I live and I told her Mwiki. She told me she has never been to Mwiki and doesnâ€™t know Mwiki and will never ever know Mwiki." Leaving Kamene in stitches, Jalas added, "She told me she has released me and maybe I would find my soulmate huko in Mwiki." The two presenters were discussing breakups. They agreed there is no amicable breakup. "Someone breaks your heart and goes ahead and tells you to promise them you will be fine. There is nothing like an amicable breakup," Kamene said.
