German sixth seed Alexander Zverev blew hot and cold with his serve but had enough artillery to take down Russian qualifier Roman Safiullin 7-6(4) 6-3 7-6(1) to reach the third round of the French Open on Wednesday. The 182nd-ranked Russian went toe-to-toe with Zverev in the baseline battle in the opening set before the German got the crucial break in the 11th game. Serving for the set, Zverev committed two double-faults to give away the advantage and had another in the tie-breaker but he recovered to take the lead with back-to-back aces. Double faults continued to haunt the 24-year-old German in the second set as he smashed his racquet on the court in frustration and suffered a service break but he recovered spectacularly to take the set by winning five games in a row. Zverev, who served 15 aces against 10 double faults, outplayed Safiullin in the third-set tiebreaker to set up a clash against the winner of the match between Serbians Laslo Djere and Miomir Kecmanovic. Meanwhile, Russia’s Daria Kasatkina delivered an early surprise at the French Open on Wednesday as she knocked 10th seed Belinda Bencic out in the second round. The 24-year-old cruised through in straight sets, winning 6-2 6-2 in one hour and 16 minutes on Court Simonne-Mathieu at Roland Garros in Paris. The world number 37 will now face the winner of Sorana Cirstea against Martina Trevisan in the third round. Slovenia’s Tamara Zidansek also progressed in straight sets. The 23-year-old beat American Madison Brengle 6-4 6-1 and awaits the winner of the game between Katerina Siniakova and Veronika Kudermetova.
