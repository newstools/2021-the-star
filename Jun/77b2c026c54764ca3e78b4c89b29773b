The National Transport and Safety Authority has announced the relocation of its headquarters. In a statement seen by the Star, the authority said its headquarters has been moved from Hill Park Building to 316 Upper Hill Chambers, along 2nd Ngong Avenue in Nairobi. "NTSA Relocates Headquarters Effective Monday, 28th June, 2021," NTSA said. Individuals who require the authority's services in Nairobi will be served from the new offices. The move comes about three weeks after NTSA announced the resumption of services after it closed down its online portal for a system upgrade and maintenance. The authority said after the upgrade, services would run on two portals ( timsvirl.ntsa.go.ke and  tims.ntsa.go.ke ) until June 30, 2021. "This is to enable all users to interact, familiarize themselves with the system and undergo scheduled virtual training sessions," NTSA said. NTSA noted that applications launched through the revamped system would also be completed in the new system, including rejected applications. On May 27, 2021, NTSA announced interruption to some of its online services which was due to their continuous service improvement strategies. The interrupted services included the Smart Driving Licence booking/enrolment, PDL, Test Booking applications, Collection of Logbooks, and Number Plates. The NTSA Mobile Application and the contact centre was also temporarily inaccessible.
