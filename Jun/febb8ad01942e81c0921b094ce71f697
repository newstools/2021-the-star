Nyeri county has started receiving drugs from the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority, ending residents' suffering. Governor Mutahi Kahiga said the drugs worth Sh41 million will come in handy for the remainder of the financial year, which ends on June 30. The first consignment of the drugs arrived on Friday and was taken to the county referral hospital, and Othaya and Mukurwe-ini level 4 hospitals. “We had a consignment going to the Nyeri County Referral Hospital, while these two will serve Karatina, Mt Kenya and Othaya level 4 hospitals,” Kahiga said. He said another lorry will be ferrying in more drugs and medical supplies until the order is cleared. “But for now, let us make do with what we have as we wait,” he said. The county has had a severe shortage of drugs, with Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina, church leaders and residents calling on the county administration to shelve all other projects and channel the available funds in procurement of drugs and other medical supplies. Maina said the shortage had reached an alarming level and patients were being sent to private pharmacies to buy drugs and other medical items. National Council of Churches of Kenya county coordinating committee chairman Simon Njoroge, secretary Moses Maina and vice chairman Joseph Njakai said some patients have had to buy syringes to get services in health facilities. They said the poor shoulder unbearable costs to stay alive, which is a drawback in the war on non-communicable diseases in Nyeri. But Kahiga blamed the shortage on the failure by the National Treasury to release money to counties. Kahiga said the Treasury owes Nyeri county Sh1.8 billion. He also blasted politicians whom he claimed were taking advantage of the situation to incite health workers and members of the public.  Edited by A.N
