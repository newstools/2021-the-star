Tanzanian singer Diamond Platumz is dating a South African model, Andrea Abrahams. In a recent interview, he said it took him nine good years to get her to fall for him. In a recent post, Andrea shared Diamond's poster of his BET nomination and wrote, "Behind you always", along with a lion and diamond emoji. Diamond was on Wasafi FM, where he said, "She is perfect, very perfect like very. She knows how to live peacefully with my family and with no drama at all." He added, "I started wooing her in 2013, she took me round in circles and only accepted me last year." Andrea is Miss Mamelodi Sundowns Mpumalanga and Miss 7 Continents of 2016. Rumours about them dating came about days after Diamond left South Africa, where he had been staying for three weeks while recording his upcoming album.
