Interior CS Fred Matiang’i visited officers receiving treatment at the Nairobi Hospital on Friday after being injured in the line of duty. The CS was accompanied by Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. The duo observed that the officers were making good progress on the path to full recuperation and wished them well. “Good progress on the path to full recuperation by our officers who got injured in the line of duty. May God reward their selfless sacrifices while protecting our country. Quick recovery lionhearts!” Matiang’i said. They then proceeded to Karen Police Station where the CS officially opened the Karen Police Station canteen. In Karen, the CS said that through the goodwill and collaboration from the Karen community, Karen Police Station has a modern canteen. He also vouched for the outcomes such constructive cooperation from members of the public can yield in the management of security in the country. Last month, Mutyambai inspected the progress of the construction of the canteen that was going on. The IG also inspected the construction of the National Police Leadership Academy in Ngong, Kajiado. President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned the construction of a leadership police academy and 210 housing units in Ngong earlier this year. The project which is funded by the Central Bank of Kenya at Sh1 billion is set to be completed by end of 2021.
