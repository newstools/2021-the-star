It was Businessman Chris Kirubi who designed the Sonko-Igathe ticket in 2017, former Nairobi deputy governor Polycarp Igathe has revealed. Speaking during the funeral service of the flamboyant businessman at the Faith Evangelistic Ministry church in Karen, Igathe also said that the long term goal of Kirubi in designing the ticket was to have the city's management revert to the national government. "It is a good time that I also reveal to you what we did with Chris. It was his idea that Nairobi goes back to the national government," he said. "I was the one to execute the agenda," he added. Igathe was elected alongside Mike Sonko to serve as deputy governor and governor respectively in 2017 on a Jubilee Party ticket. The political marriage however broke down following the resignation of Igathe, citing differences with Sonko. Kirubi's associates from his various business ventures eulogized him as a gut-led investor who strived to have a personal relationship with every one of his contact. "Chairman was full of magic and logic. He treated everyone with respect," said Igathe, who spoke on behalf of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. "He advocated for treating customers as human beings with needs and not those with wallets." Igathe said he was the cog that sustained the Prime Minister's roundtable that was held regularly by the former Premier Odinga during the grand coalition government. "He was my mentor, my teacher and my guide in business and life," he said. Nasa leaders Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya) and Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) are among national leaders attending the memorial service of the late Industrialist. Also present is former presidential candidate Peter Kenneth.
