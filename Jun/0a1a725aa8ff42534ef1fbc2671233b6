@robertomollo3  Homa Bay county assembly clerk Hannington Ochieng has resigned citing frustrations and interference with his mandate, barely two months after taking over office. In a letter to county assembly speaker Elizabeth Ayoo who chairs the county assembly service board, Ochieng said he could not continue with his work in an increasingly volatile environment. He said his efforts to create a good working relationship with stakeholders for the benefit of Homa Bay residents have hit a snag. “The volatile environment can’t allow me discharge my duties effectively. My conscience is clear and that under the prevailing circumstances, it is untenable to continue performing my duties uncompromisingly,” Ochieng said in the letter dated June 4. Ochieng' took office in April when he replaced Daniel Kaudo who was ousted by MCAs for alleged involvement in internal wrangles. But less than two months into office, the new clerk said he found it difficult to discharge his mandate. Ochieng said he was leaving in good faith and was ready to offer any transition assistance should there be need to do so. “Please accept this communication as my resignation from the position of the clerk of the county assembly. But I am ready to offer any assistance during the transition,” he said. He said his resignation takes effect immediately. The clerk also argued that his resignation would give him adequate time and space to pursue an advanced course which he did not mention. The official said he will surrender his May salary because he did not work due to frustrations. “Please let it be known that I am ready to offer any assistance including May salary. I wish you all the employees and various stakeholders of Homa Bay county assembly the very best going forward.”  Edited by P.O
