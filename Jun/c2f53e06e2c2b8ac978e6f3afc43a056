Comedian Eric Omondi has backed bongo star Diamond Platnumz for the BET awards. Diamond has been nominated as the Best International Act. He will battle it out with Nigeria's Burna Boy, Wizkid and seven other contestants. "As the president of entertainment in Africa, I want to call upon East Africa and the entire content of Africa to stand up and vote to bring @bet Award to East Afrca. Let us vote for @diamondplatnumz." In response, Diamond wrote, "Eric my #SwahiliNation brother." Diamond's nomination has been received mixed reactions from Tanzanians. Those in support of Diamond are pushing for the singer to win the award, while those against the singer are pushing for Nigeria's Burna Boy to take the award. In 2017, Rayvanny became the first artiste from Tanzania to win a BET Award.
