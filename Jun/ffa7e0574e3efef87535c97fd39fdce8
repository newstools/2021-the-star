 @robertomollo3  Médecins Sans Frontières has warned about increasing cases of Covid-19 infections in Homa Bay and asked residents to be very vigilant. The Doctors Without Borders said many people were contracting the disease and asked for caution. They implored residents to strictly adhere to public safety protocols of wearing face masks, avoiding gatherings and regular washing of hands with soap and running water. They said it was unfortunate that some residents were disregarding the safety protocols. MSF said the number of patients being admitted to Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital due to Covid-19 is alarming. They said the situation could worsen if infections persist. The organisation asked authorities to intensify enforcement measures. Homa Bay MSF project coordinator Roshni Mahida on Saturday said the situation has pushed them to expand the High Dependency Units at the hospital. Additional HDU tents have been set up within the hospital compound. The Homa Bay hospital previously had 10 HDU beds. Now they are 32. “Homa Bay residents should not drop their guard in keeping the Covid-19 at bay," Mahida said. She said three patients were in critical condition. Some 98 patients were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19. A similar number of admissions was recorded in the first three weeks of June. Mahida said 20 patients died at the facility in May due to Covid-related complications. “The situation is increasingly becoming dire. People must change their behaviour because about half of patients seeking services at the Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital test positive for Covid-19,” she said.  Edited by P.O
