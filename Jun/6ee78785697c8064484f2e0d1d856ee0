Sports Cabinet Secretary Ambassador Amina Mohamed has said they are ready to accommodate fans as long as they follow the laid down Covid-19 protocols when WRC Safari Rally roars into action on Thursday. Amina also called on fans to work hand in hand with the security personnel and safety marshals to ensure the Safari Rally runs smoothly through the weekend. Speaking at the WRC Safari Rally Media Centre in Naivasha, the CS said there will be designated areas provided by the organisers where spectators will be able to catch the action. “Safari is an international event and we would like our spectators to enjoy the action first hand. We don’t want them to break rules during the event. Previously, we have been blacklisted as a result of not following rules, and this time round I urge you to follow instructions to the letter as directed by the marshals and security officers,” said Amina. Fans in Nairobi will follow the action at Kasarani Stadium from 2 pm onwards. This will be preceded by the ceremonial start at the KICC. Day two on Friday will traverse Chui Lodge, Kedong, and Oserian. Saturday's route will head towards Souysambu, Sleeping Warrior, and Elementeita. The last day on Sunday will go to Loldia, Hell’s Gate, and Malewa. The second run of Hell’s Gate will be the official power stage, where World Rally drivers will earn bonus points.
