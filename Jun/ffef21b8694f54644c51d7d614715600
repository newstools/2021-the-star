Retired Chief Justice, David Maraga has called on Kenyans to stand up against impunity, saying that if we are not careful, the aftermath of the next general election could be worse than that of 2007. According to the former CJ, if the issue of election fraud is not solved, there will be disputes and things can get ugly from there onwards. "This country is ours let everybody say no to impunity. If we don't do that, like in the coming general election, what we saw in 2007 was child's play. People are playing around, forget these things they say," Maraga said. Maraga who spoke on KTN News, on Wednesday, faulted the government for applying the law selectively when it comes to public gatherings, insisting that this is what will create problems. He singled out the way some leaders have been having their gatherings dismissed by the police, while others hold rallies with bigger crowds without being asked. Maraga said that what Kenya needs is an independent, electoral commission (IEBC), one that will conduct elections where everybody will accept what they have as results. He noted that those do not remember what happened in 2007 will not know where he is coming from. "If we have electoral fraud committed in the next election, whether the constitution will have been amended and you have the position of Prime Minister and others we will go back to the same problems because what needs to be addressed is to ensuring we have an independent IEBC," he said. Maraga stated that when they were deciding the 2017 presidential election petition, they looked at where the country had come from in 2007 among other factors. "...and said we have to make a stop to this so that everybody follows the law as required." During the interview, the Chief Justice Emeritus addressed among other issues; President Uhuru Kenyatta's decision to appoint 34 judges leaving out six and what he termed as Uhuru's continued disregard for the rule of law.
