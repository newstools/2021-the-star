Fredrick Ochieng Otieno volunteered to sensitise the public across 25 counties on Covid-19 pandemic using his bicycle. The 28-year-old man uses a small amplifier and battery of 12volts where he plays songs to sensitise the public on Covid-19 as he cycles across the counties. He also has messages written on his bicycle. Speaking to journalists on Sunday while on his Bungoma county sensitisation tour, Ochieng said he decided to concentrate on Western counties because they are now hotspots of the Indian variant. "Western and Nyanza have been mapped as hotspot regions for Covid-19. I am appealing to residents to follow the guidelines put in place to curb the spread of the pandemic," he said. Ochieng was born in Siaya but lives and works as a painter in Marsabit. He will be winding up his sensitisation exercise in Turkana after touring 25 counties. He has already toured 19 counties including: Tana River, Kilifi, Mombasa, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Makueni, Kitui, Machakos, Kajiado, Narok, Bomet, Nyamira, Kisii, Migori, Homa Bay, Vihiga, Kakamega, Bungoma and Nandi. Ochieng started the sensitisation on May 10. He is yet to visit Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot and Turkana. He asked residents to support with him. He said that his bicycle allows him access to remote areas with poor road networks. "Using my bicycle I access areas that cannot be reached by a vehicle or a motorcycle," he said. He asked the Ministry of Health to intervene and if possible fund him to keep on spreading sensitisation messages to Kenyans. Ochieng urged CS Mutahi Kagwe to receive his calls. "I have been trying to reach out to our able Health CS Mutahi Kagwe but my efforts have hit a dead end," he said. In his appeal, he asked county governments to ensure that residents have face masks and they put them on properly. Apart from his sensitisation exercise he also advocates against drug abuse among youths in the country. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
