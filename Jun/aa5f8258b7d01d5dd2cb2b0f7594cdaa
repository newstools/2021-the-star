Early childhood education is set to receive a major boost when President Uhuru Kenyatta and British Prime Minister Borris Johnson co-host the Global Partnership for Education Replenishment Summit on July 28 and 29. The initiative will bring together heads of state, ministers, civil society organisations and other partners to contribute to the provision of quality education. The summit aims at raising at least $5 billion to support education systems and improve quality education in 90 countries. The funds will enable 175 million girls and boys to learn and reach 140 million students with professionally trained teachers. Forty-six million more girls will also benefit from the funds. GPE has new strategies for 2021-25 that include commitments for all children to receive at least one year of quality pre-primary education. A report by Unicef shows children are not a priority in budgetary allocation. The President has been asked to consider allocating 10 per cent of the national budget to the development of ECDEs. Children aged between three and six are expected to receive an all-round education. ECDEs in the country are faced with numerous challenges, including inadequate teaching resources and financial constraints. On May 13, President Kenyatta at Westlands Primary School and Johnson at Cleves Cross Primary school engaged in an online meeting. The meeting was aimed at creating collaboration with schools by recruiting and educating them on matters that affect the globe and prioritise technology and girlsâ€™ education.
