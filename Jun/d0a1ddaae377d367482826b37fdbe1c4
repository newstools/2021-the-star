The country is about to know how the government through Treasury CS Ukur Yatani is planning to spend and finance its biggest Budget ever in the country. Treasury CS will present his Sh3.63 trillion budget for the year 2021-2022, which is much of cushioning Kenyans as well as recovery of the country’s economy following the disruption of coronavirus. Yatani was in his office early in the day to put the final touches to the budget. The preparation for the day has been geared up along the roads leading to the Parliament Buildings, right from the Treasury offices. To ease the flow of movement along the roads leading to Parliament, several roads in Nairobi will remain closed in the afternoon. In a statement, Nairobi Regional Commander James Kianda said this will allow easy movement to and from Parliament, during the reading of the Budget. The roads that will remain closed include; Parliament Road, Harambee Avenue, Taifa Road, and City Hall Way. According to the CS, Sh3.63 trillion budget will strike a balance between stimulating economic recovery and responding to the health challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This year’s budget will be the second to be read under the Covid-19 pandemic, which has heavily affected the country’s economy. The CS has proposed to invest Sh26.6 billion on the Post-Covid Economic Stimulus Programme (PC-ESP) and Sh135.3 billion on the President’s Big Four Agenda.
