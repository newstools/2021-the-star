A man who sued Kenya Power over a Sh616,000 bill he received in 2018 will have it reviewed. The High Court found that the bill Kenya Power sent to Alan Donovan was without basis and justification. The electricity supplier also cut Donovan's connection. Justice James Makau on Thursday ruled that KPLC had violated the petitioner's guaranteed right to goods and services. “A declaration be and is hereby issued that the violation of Donovan’s right to goods and services of reasonable quality and the enjoyment of their full benefit thereof has occasioned him loss of money as a resource, time spent following up on the issues he has been raising with KPLC,” the court ruled. The judge ordered Kenya Power to bill Donovan based solely on the actual meter readings on the set tariffs. “I note KPLC contended that all its bills to the Petitioner were based on actual and verifiable meter reading No 0317403. The issue of the alleged consumption which were not factored before has not been demonstrated by adducing the various bills between 2006 and 2018,” the court said. The court wondered why KPLC was demanding the sum without supportive bills.
