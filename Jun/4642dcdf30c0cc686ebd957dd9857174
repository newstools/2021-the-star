Wales vs Denmark 26/6/2021 19:00 Wales’ reward for claiming second spot in Group 'A' is a tie against Denmark in Amsterdam, a game the Welsh will feel is winnable. Wales surprised everyone with their performance at Euro 2016 and they are doing it again at Euro 2020, while Denmark have shown great commitment to this competition after losing their star player in their first game against Finland. Wales have now qualified for the round of 16 for a second consecutive time at the Euros. In 2016, they topped the group above England with two wins. This time, they beat Switzerland on goal difference, the team they drew 1-1 with on Matchday One. Denmark needed a big win against Russia to stand any chance of progressing to the knockouts as they started the match sitting at bottom of the group with defeats to Finland and Belgium. Denmark’s route to the knockout stage has been a well-documented one, recovering from the harrowing events that unfolded in their opener against Finland to put in a great, if ultimately unrewarded, performance against the world number one ranked side Belgium. Matches between these two countries don’t always produce a lot of goals but the last two that did end in 2-1 scorelines. Three of Denmark’s last six outings have seen over 2.5 goals scored with the Danes scoring four goals against Russia last time out. However, Wales won’t prove as easy to penetrate as the Russians did and as Turkey and Switzerland found out, Wales have goals in them.

Against Turkey and Switzerland, they were lethal in the 3-0 wins, while a completely different starting eleven managed to edge past Wales with a solitary goal in a game that saw several squandered chances. The performance against Wales highlights two points: goals could dry out without Insigne, Berardi and Immobile upfront; and Mancini has plenty of like-to-like players in defense and midfield. Austria went into Matchday Three needing a win to qualify as runners up of the group and came out with 1-0 win against Ukraine. This helped them to stay clear of Ukraine with a three-point lead having defeated North Macedonia in the first game. This is the first time Austria qualified for the knockouts at Euro, having finished the group stage without a win in 2008 and 2016. Over 2.5 goals have been scored in four of Italy’s last five matches, with the Italians winning two of their group games by three goals to nil. Two of Austria’s last six international matches have produced over 3.5 goals with one of those being a 4-0 defeat to Denmark. Another reason we are expecting goals in this game is down to the fact that four of the last six meetings between these two nations have witnessed at least three goals being scored.

In that game, Belgium had 60 per cent possession and 17 shots at goal with seven of them on target. The only player to score for Belgium was Romelu Lukaku (81’). Finland had 7 shots on goal with 1 of them on target. Lukáš Hrádecký (74’ Own goal) was the scorer for Finland. Their latest results really do illustrate the point that not much more can be done by the Belgium defence. De Rode Duivels have been stingy, seeing the tally of goals that have gone in at their end over the course of their previous six outings standing at two. That aside, time will tell whether such a trend shall continue. Four of the last seven head-to-heads between the pair have ended with both teams getting on the scoreboard, and we’re backing goals in this game at both ends of the pitch. Belgium have scored at least one goal in each of their last six international matches, putting eight past Belarus in March. Both teams have scored in three of Portugal’s last six outings, including their last two group games against France and Germany.
