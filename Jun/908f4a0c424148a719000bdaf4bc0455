Embu teachers have called on their employer TSC to review their collective bargaining agreement to address challenges of promotions. The CBA expires this month. Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association chairman for Embu Benson Njue on Saturday said the new CBA should address career progression. “We do not want to stagnate. There are several bottlenecks in the current CBA and we want that addressed. For instance, there are very many grades due for promotion that have been placed in career progression which requires interviews,” Njue said. Most secondary school teachers are in grade C, for them to move from C1 to C4 one must attend four interviews. "The time and duration are not even known, this lengthens the process,” Njue said. He was speaking during a conference for secondary school heads in North Imenti, Meru county. Njue said teachers have a challenges dealing with students who often defy the ministry of health regulations. “Society is not adhering to the ministry's guidelines on Covid-19. People are taking things for granted and hence students learn from the same. It is challenging and puts teachers who are older and more vulnerable to Covid-19 at risk,” he said. Kagumo High School principal Silas Mwirigi advised teachers nearing their retirement to start investing especially in farming as preparations for life after their profession. “When you retire, nobody will recognise or remember what you did no matter how good your school performed. You will only be left with your family, so its good to have something instead of just waiting for pension,” Mwirigi said. Nanyuki Boys High School principal Oliver Minish said headteachers are sometimes stressed and do not have personal time. “They need to take sometime off especially during weekends and relax while doing things that they like. I go out and dance to relieve stress,” Minish said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
