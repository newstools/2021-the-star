Amos Butit won the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) golf tournament crown at Eldoret Golf Club to end a four-year title drought. The handicap 12 golfer last won the KPC title four years ago on the same course. Butit took advantage of home course to fire 40 stableford points,  beating Nandi Bears' J. Kiplimo and Johnson Korir to second and third positions respectively on 39 points. “I last won the KPC title four years ago and I am happy to have done it again. I played well owing to my good preparations,” said Bitit. Butit started off with a blank in hole one par 5, dropped one in two, three and four recovered with a birdie on 5, 6, and 7 before bogeying on hole 8 and 9 for a total of 19 points in the inward nine. “I was so motivated with such a great team of Anita Kimwatan, Mary Kiptoo and Wesley Kipkosgei on the course. It was so good that we enjoyed the whole tournament,” he added. He said the only challenge was that they played early in the morning  and this made the greens slow. “I had a slow start in the morning but the recovery was good and I managed 21 points,” he said. On the second nine, Butit fired two birdies, three pars and five bogeys. Former club’s lady captain Jane Koech won the staff prize on 32 points while  former chairman Sandeep Grewal won nearest to the pin prize. Mildred Natecho and Parit Sangrajka won the women and men's longest drive awards respectively.
