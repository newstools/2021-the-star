Polytechnics in Kakamega will start making county staff uniforms and furniture for Early Childhood Development Education learners, Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said. He said the move was meant to enable polytechnics to be financially stable instead of relying on county government funding. "I have directed ministries not to outsource desks for ECDE learners and uniforms for our officers, but to give the tenders to selected polytechnics with the capacity to manufacture them. This will also address the issue of capital flight," Oparanya said. He spoke on Monday at Nzoia Polytechnic in Likuyani subcounty. The governor later opened Kongoni ECDE centre. Nzoia is one of the polytechnics selected to make desks for learners at a cost of Sh5 million. "I am impressed by the work done by the institution. I urge others to emulate them," Oparanya said. The governor challenged polytechnics to embrace technology to facilitate growth. He said he was shocked that students were using vehicles made in the 1960s for their practicals, adding that such machines were outdated. Oparanya said the county will soon establish land tribunals locally to handle disputes to minimise the backlog of court cases. He said the tribunals will comprise county and national government officers. Oparanya urged residents to make use of the tribunal once they are constituted. People who will take their cases to court without passing through the tribunals will be referred back to the tribunals, he said. Present were education executive George Lutomia and his lands counterpart Robert Makhanu, education chief officer Irene Ashioya and deputy chief of staff Herbert Sore. Edited by A.N
