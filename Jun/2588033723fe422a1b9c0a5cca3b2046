A man has been charged in a Kakamega court for masquerading as a lawyer in various towns in the region, defrauding innocent members of the public who he purported to represent in court. Last Friday, the police arraigned Ronald Namisi, also known variously as Ronald Namisi Karani, and Ronald Namisi Amukhale to court where he pleaded not guilty. He was charged with six counts, including uttering a false document, making false documents without authority, personation among others. The alleged quack is said to have purported to draw legal documents to represent unsuspecting members of the public until he was busted. According to the police charge sheet, Namisi is alleged to have authored fake documents. the documents included purported certificate of urgency plaints, affidavits, and petitions among others were his stock in trade to sustain his criminal enterprise. Law Society of Kenya Chief Executive Mercy Wambua confirmed to the Star that the case of Namisi had reached her desk through numerous complaints. The latest, she said, was a complaint by a magistrate who reached out to her concerned by Namisi’s competence when he appeared before her. He practiced in Kakamega, Webuye, and Nakuru. He was released on Sh50,000 cash bail. According to an advocate practicing certificate for 2019 allegedly forged by the accused, Namisi claims that he got called to the bar in 2016 with a fake registration number P105/12606/16. Police arrested him on May 20, put him in custody, and later charged him last Friday. The accused is said to have operated for long unnoticed. But Wambua said her colleagues always reported that Namisi did not know how to address the court, the basic mannerism, and conduct of an advocate, heightening the suspicions against him. "Like the magistrate said this man did not even know how to address the court.",” she said. “Even peers marked him out because he did not seem to know basic practice etiquette,” she said.
