City residents will not suffer severe water rationing as there is enough supply until the short rains begin. Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company  boss Nahason Muguna told the Star on Thursday all the dams supplying the city are full. "Water supply to the city will remain as it is; there will be no severe rationing," Muguna said. The company supplies the city with 525,000 cubic meters per day against a demand of 830,000 cubic meters. This leaves a deficit of over 305, 000 cubic meters. "The deficit is huge," Muguna said. The Northern Collector Tunnel is expected to bring an additional 140,000 cubic metres per day. The project is derived from the Nairobi Water Master Plan for Developing New Water Sources for Nairobi and 13 Satellite Towns. These towns include Kikuyu, Ruiru-Juja, Kiambu, Karuri, Githunguri, Mavoko, Ngong, Ongata Rongai, Thika, Gatundu, Limuru, Lari and Tala-Kangundo. The Northern Collector Tunnel Phase I includes river diversion and related intake hydraulic structures at Maragua, Gikigie and Irati Rivers as well as the construction of a river outlet at Githika River which will convey the additional water to Thika dam. The tunnel is approximately 11.8km long and three meters finished internal diameter. The project was to be completed by December 2020. The implementing agency - Athi Water Works - has been mum about the cause of the delay. The city's population of 4,397, 073 people has been grappling with water shortage for years as the demand keeps rising. The master plan projects the city will require 1.2 billion litres of water daily by 2035. Nairobi City gets its water from Sasamua, Ndakaini and Ruiru dams. Located in Njambini, Nyandarua county, Sasamua's Phase I was completed in 1955 and Phase II in 1968. It sits on Sasumua River but receives water from Kibiru and Chania . It has a storage capacity of 15.9 million cubic meters with a design yield of 59,000 cubic meters per day. Water from the dam is treated at Sasumua Dam Treatment plant and serves Kabete Treatment Works with 60km water pipeline. The combined catchment area of the Sasumua, Chania and Kiburu streams is approximately 12,800 hectares (31,629.4 acres). Which contributes to approximately 12 per cent to Nairobi’s current water supply. Thika dam located in Ndakaini, Murang’a county was completed in 1994. The designed storage capacity is 70,000,000 cubic meters and is linked to Chania River by a 4km tunnel that serves Ngethu Water Treatment Works. The 90km pipeline to Nairobi has a catchment area of 75km2. Thika, Githika and Kakuyu are the main rivers draining into the dam. The dam contributes approximately 84 per cent of Nairobi’s current water supply. The Ruiru source located in Githunguri, Kiambu county on Ruiru River, was completed in 1950. The storage capacity is 2.9 million cubic meters of raw water with a yield of 21,600 cubic meters per day. Water from the dam is treated at Kabete plant and contributes about four per cent of Nairobi’s current water supply. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
