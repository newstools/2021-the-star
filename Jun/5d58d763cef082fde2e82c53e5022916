Kenya Morans coach Liz Mills will return to the country in July to prepare the national team for the FIBA Afro-Basket 2021 finals slated for Kigali, Rwanda in August. The tactician, who guided Kenya to the continent’s flagship championships in nearly three decades, said she cherished the duel against Africa’s big boys. “I am really excited about our group and the opportunity to compete against the best teams in Africa,” she said from her home in Australia. “This will be a greater experience for us and we can build on this as we prepare for the 2023 FIBA World Cup qualifiers later this year.” Kenya have been pooled in Group ‘C’ alongside favourites Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire and the fast-rising Mali during the draws conducted over the weekend in Kigali. Mills, who made history as the first female head coach to lead a team to the tournament, was impressed by the team’s display in the February qualifiers in Yaounde, Cameroon. Morans beat 11-time champions Angola 74-71 but went down 69-51 to Senegal and 71-44 to Mozambique who did not make it to the next phase. The Australian basketball coach, who has been working in Africa for the past decade as head coach and assistant coach, is on record as saying she was not going to Kigali to make up the numbers. Meanwhile, Zamalek of Egypt won the inaugural Basketball Africa League (BAL) championships beating favourites US Monastir 76-63 in an all North African final in Kigali, Rwanda. The Egyptians defeated Angolan giants Petro de Luanda 89-71 in the first semi while Monastir thumped hosts Patriots 87-46 in the other semi. Petro Luanda clinched the bronze medal when they beat Patriots 97-68 in the third/fourth play off game. The two-week tournament was played at the iconic Kigali Arena and bought together 12 of Africa’s top teams.
