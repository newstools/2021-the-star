The Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife has announced the reopening of the Mama Ngina Waterfront on Thursday. In a statement seen by the Star, Tourism Principal Secretary Safina Kwekwe said the park will be opened for controlled trade, exercise and recreational use for members of the public. "The Waterfront will be opened daily from 6:00 am to 6:30 pm." "Only the traders with designated work-sites (stalls) within the Waterfront are allowed to conduct business in the Waterfront," Kwekwe said. The PS called on members of the public to comply with all set health protocols and any other guidelines that will be given by the Waterfront staff. Meetings and all forms of gatherings, tuk tuks and motorbikes, and hawking is prohibited at the park. According to the statement, parking vehicles in non-designated areas and entry into the park at non-designated time is also prohibited. The park sits on about 26 acres of land. The reopening comes a few weeks after Mvita MP, Abdulswamad Nassir petitioned the National Assembly to reopen Mama Ngina Waterfront and Jomo Kenyatta public beach in Mombasa. Nassir said traders who were operating in the said areas had suffered immense losses. "The traders are willing to adhere to Covid-19 guidelines. Some of them have been in business for over 40 years hence have challenges switching to other ventures," Nassir said. The waterfront and public beach were closed in adherence with restrictions to contain the spread of Covid-19. Over 500 traders involved in different businesses who were forced to make way for the renovations but have since not been allowed back.
