Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has broken her silence over a row on a prime one-acre plot in Kitui town whose ownership has pitted Kitui assembly speaker George Ndotto and renowned environmentalist Isaac Kalua. On Monday Ngilu visited the plot where Checkler Oil Products Limited a company associated with Kalua, has stationed workers and an earthmover to clear the place. She had ostensibly moved to the plot to intervene in a violent clash between youth allied to Kalua and his company and another group allied to Ndotto. The pro- Ndotto’s supporters had arrived at the site to eject the group stationed there to keep watch as construction work got underway. The two groups engaged each other in running battles for two hours as they used stones and catapults leaving a number of them badly injured before the police arrived and managed to stop the violent confrontation. Ngilu who got wind of the clash between the two rival groups arrived in the company of Ndotto shortly after the police had restored calm and openly sided with the group that insisted that the contested plot belonged to Ndotto. “The majority here say this plot belongs to Ndotto, and that is the same position I hold. We are not going to condone land grabbing here,” Ngilu said. The pro-Ndotto group moved in, tore down a perimeter fence that had been erected using timber and corrugated iron sheets by the Checker Oil Products Limited. Shortly after, a county government earth mover also started filling up a trench that had been dug around the plot. Ndotto is fighting for control of prime land he claims he was allocated by former President Daniel  Moi when he served in his cabinet in 1989. The prime plot is situated along the Kitui–Nairobi highway, opposite Kitui Prison.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
