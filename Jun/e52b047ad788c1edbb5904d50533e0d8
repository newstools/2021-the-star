The offices of The Service Party (TSP) headquarters in Upperhill, Nairobi were destroyed in the wee hours of Thursday by unknown people. In a statement, the TSP secretary general said that the thieves took away important equipment and documents that belong to the party, including laptops, party seal, printers, and hard disks. They also lit fire to burn party registration forms that had recruitment data on them. The party said the equipment vandalized was worth Sh3 million. “We have since reported the matter to Capitol Police station and their response was good and timely. They have commenced investigations following our recording of statements. We expect the police to move swiftly and apprehend the culprits,” the secretary-general said. TSP leader Mwangi Kiunjuri said they will not be intimidated but instead will march on with their grand plan to popularise the outfit. "They stole the computers and we think they were looking for information. As we wait for the police, we will match on with our plans," he told the Star on the phone. The attack comes barely a week after the ex- Agriculture CS was teargassed by police in Embu County while chairing the meeting. It has also condemned burglary and vandalism, adding that a few weeks ago, TSP meetings were disrupted, where police teargassed participants. “We hope this country is not being taken back to the days whereby political parties were intimidated to stop them from advancing their agenda or silence them from being the voice of the people.” Nevertheless, the party said that its office doors are still open to serve each and everyone and that the data they have destroyed or stolen was well backed up and protected.
