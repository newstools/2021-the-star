IEBC chairman Wafula  Chebukati says the number of registered voters has increased by 149,600 since the 2017 General Election. The number of eligible voters now stands at 19,678,885. Chebukati said IEBC is seeking to mobilize more Kenyans to register as voters before the 2022 polls. "IEBC encourages those eligible for registration to visit our Constituency Offices for enrolment. IEBC shall be effecting transfers and change of particulars for voters whose details may have changed," he said. He spoke on Monday during the Annual Voter Education Week that will be conducted in all 290 Constituencies for a period of seven days. "AVEW is an annual event that proffers the Commission and its staff an opportune moment to interact with voters, members of the public, partners, and stakeholders in the 47 Counties and 290 Constituencies in the country" Chebukati said. United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott, who was also present, said the UK is working with IEBC in a new programme to support Kenya as a leading democracy in the region. "We shall support the IEBC in the areas of voter registration, voter education, strengthening institutional capacity, and work with ORPP in encouraging women to register and run for elective offices," Marriott said. Meanwhile, IEBC has received criticism from a section of leaders who accused the commission of being ill-prepared for the election. The selection panel appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta has been urged to fast-track the appointment of IEBC commissioners. IEBC currently operates with only three commissioners instead of seven, including the chairman. On Saturday, the selection panel shortlisted and published the names of  36 individuals from a pool of 660 applicants. The shortlisted candidates are set to proceed to the next stage – interviews – which will run from July 7 to 22.
