Data from the Health ministry shows that 160 are healthcare workers, 17 are security personnel, four are people aged 58 years and above and 22 are other members of the public. As of Monday, 969,489 people had received their first Covid-19 vaccine jab. Of this number, 165,513 are healthcare workers, 152,387 teachers, 82,077 security personnel, 294,245 are people aged 58 years and above while 275,267 are members of the public. On Saturday, the country received 72,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from South Sudan. The vaccines arrived in the country on Saturday aboard Kenya Airways flight shortly after 5pm. The doses were delivered to the national vaccine depot in Kitengela for distribution to nine regional depots. South Sudan received 132,000 doses from Covax but had only managed to deploy 8,000 doses due to training and logistical challenges. The remaining vaccines had to be redistributed to other countries before they expire. The 100,000 doses that were already in the country are expected to expire on June 28. “We are starting the second vaccination with about 100,000 doses that are in the country and the CS has said no more first dose will be given,” head of vaccine deployment taskforce Dr Willis Akhwale said. On Monday, the Health ministry said 88 people had tested positive for the virus from a sample size of 1,668. This represents a positivity of 5.3 per cent. “Fifteen people have been reported dead having succumbed to the disease with all reports relating to facility audit records conducted on diverse dates in April,” Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said. This pushes the cumulative number of deaths in the country to 3,172. The CS said 71 more patients had recovered, 64 from home-based care and seven from various health facilities, pushing the number of recoveries to 116,847. “Some 1,237 patients are currently admitted to various health facilities across the country, while 4,661 are on home-based isolation and care,” Kagwe said. Ninety-three patients are in the ICU, out of whom 21 are on ventilator support, 55 on supplemental oxygen and 17 under observation.
