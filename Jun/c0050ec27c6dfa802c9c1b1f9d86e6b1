Kiterere villagers in Suna West have lauded completion of a new bridge over river Nyamahiriria and road network which has been a campaign pledge since the 1992. The bridge has been used as a campaign pledge by many politicians in Suna West to woo voters in the remote village but ignore the pledge after being elected to office. “We only become relevant during the election period when bloggers take photos of the makeshift wooden bridge we had constructed to bash rivals in social media,” Mzee Caleb Thabaka, Kiterere village elder said. Felly Ambio, another village elder said because the place is remote, residents of Kiterere, Obuya, Ragana and Kanyanganda villages were always cut off from major trading centres especially during long rains. Ambio said last June, a woman who was being taken to the hospital on a wooden makeshift stretcher died at the bridge as they struggled to cross. He said mourners were also forced to carry coffins for long distance on shoulders as roads were impassable. “We have so far lost over 10 villagers over the bridge and several livestock swept away during heavy rains,” Ambio said. The bridge constructed by the Suna West NG-CDF also saw opening of roads around the three villages to facilitate movement and access to nearby Ragana primary school and Ragana dispensary and access to Migori. “It feels good that for the first time we can stand on a solid bridge and water is flowing under us, we were used to wading through the river and waiting for it to subside during heavy rains with our school going children,” Emma Abura, a villager said. - Edited by SKanyara
