Early last year, the country fretted as alarming reports of a wild increase in teenage pregnancies during the lockdown poured in. Some data, wrongly attributed to the Kenya Health Information Management System (KHIS), claimed there was a 40 per cent rise in teen pregnancies during the school closure. It turns out that the reports were greatly exaggerated, had faulty data and tended toward panic. A review of the entire KHIS data for 2020 showed a steep decline in teen pregnancies throughout last year. “Adolescent pregnancies in 2020 are less than the numbers in 2018 and 2019,” said Dr Agatha Olago, head of the division of primary health services and family medicine at the Ministry of Health. The numbers, reported each month last year, remained much lower than the monthly reports for 2019 and 2018. The highest increase in teen pregnancies last year was in July, when they constituted 24 per cent of all clients on first-time antenatal visits. But that was still lower than 29 per cent in July 2019 and 30.6 per cent in July 2018. In 2019 the share of teen pregnancies remained over 29 per cent throughout, and only dipped to 25.5 per cent in October before rising again. Olago presented the data at a CSOs meeting organised by the Health NGOs Network (Hennet), Waci Health and Path. The data suggest any increase in teen pregnancies probably happened long after the lockdown, especially during the December festivities. “There is only a slight increase in proportion of adolescent pregnancies in March 2021 noted,” Olago said. Dr Olago said it is possible some expectant adolescents chose not to attend ANC visits at all. “Pregnancies may be missed across the three years as there are barriers to adolescents accessing healthcare,” she said. The KHIS data show only West Pokot, Turkana, Kajiado, and Nairobi reported slightly higher cases of teen pregnancies (nine – 19-year-olds) between January and May last year compared to a similar period in 2019. Nairobi had 11,795 teenage pregnancies in January-May 2020, compared to 11,410 pregnancies reported in a similar period in 2019. The latest figures also defy the explanation that the count was lost due to low outpatient visits throughout last year. This is because deliveries in hospitals remained consistently higher last year than the last two years. The peak was September last year when 104,521 women gave birth in health facilities, compared to 101,988 in September 2019 and 98,514 in September 2018. “Skilled birth attendance coverage trend has been one of the least affected by the pandemic compared to other indicators. The indicator remained higher than previous years in 2020,” Olago said. There was only a decline in December last year when 86,405 women gave birth in health facilities, compared to about 94,000 in 2019 and 2018. However, the numbers picked up in January and February this year. Separately, the National Hospital Insurance Fund says although more women gave birth in hospitals last year compared to 2019, there was no significant increase in adolescents. The NHIF data showed 974,774 births from March 2020 to February 2021 compared to 913,618 births in March 2019- February 2020. This represented an increase of 61,156 births. The increase is not unusual because registered births have been rising every year since 2015, according to the Economic Survey 2020.
