Projects worth Sh2.4 billion undertaken in 2019 in Kajiado were of poor quality, some overdue and others were varied without approval, Auditor General Nancy Gathungu says in a report. The audit report examined records of the acquisition of assets and sampled project documents where it found several flaws in the 2018-19 programmes. “Consequently, the validity and value for money on payments totalling Sh2.43 billion spent on the acquisition of assets during the year under review has not been confirmed,” Gathungu said. She has also questioned Governor Joseph Lenku's administration for unsupported payment to employees amounting to Sh2.6 billion. The auditor said there was an increase of Sh503.7 million or 24 per cent of Sh2.1 billion used on the employees during the 2017-18 financial year. “The authorised staff establishment as of June 30, 2019, was not availed for audit and as a result, the cause of the increase could not be confirmed,” the report reads. Gathungu also queried variation in revenue collection where receipts and payments reflected Sh1.075 billion while the e-system ledger had Sh1.06 billion. The unexplained variance was Sh15 million. Further, Kajiado's revenue account showed Sh1.029 billion which differed by Sh46.7 million and Sh30.9 million from the balances reflected in the financial statements and the outsourced system respectively. “The accuracy of own generated revenue balance of Sh1.07 billion could not thus be confirmed,” the audit report says. The management did not also explain payments of Sh49 million to a firm managing the own revenue collection electronic system used by the county. Gathungu also sought answers on payments of Sh34.4 million as insurance costs. The county did not provide records of the services provided so the validity of the payments could not be confirmed. The county financial statements reflect a final expenditure budget of Sh9.6 billion and an actual expenditure of Sh8.3 billion. It shows an under-expenditure of Sh1.23 billion during the year under review. The county targeted to collect Sh1.58 billion as internal revenue but ended up collecting Sh1.07 billion. The administration did not explain the shortfall of Sh507 million. County records also indicated pending bills of Sh1.3 billion, out of which Sh400 million was incurred during the year under review.  The auditor said the amount was a sharp increase from Sh766.8 million in June 2018. “Unpaid bills slow down economic activity and may discourage local business from trading with public entities,” Gathungu said in the report.
