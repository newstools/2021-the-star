A case in which businesswoman Josephine Kabura and others are charged with money laundering in connection with the loss of Sh791 million from the National Youth Service has for the second time been adjourned to September 13. The case had been adjourned on Monday to allow one of the accused persons -Samuel Mudanyi - to hire a new lawyer following the demise of advocate Joseph Wagara. Yesterday, Mudanyi informed the court that he will be represented by advocate Kiraithe Wandugi. Wandugi told chief magistrate Martha Mutuku that his client has made all efforts to retrieve documents from the late Wagara but unfortunately he has not been successful. “I have no clue as to the extent of the proceedings.  For the remaining witnesses, I will need to have copies of the documents. I'm constrained to beg for an adjournment for today. I'm willing to take early dates,” he said. But the prosecution opposed the adjournment application, saying the accused had over one month to look for an advocate and that the orders of the court were clear that the matter should proceed today. Mutuku, however, allowed the application and said the matter will proceed on September 13, 14 and 15. In the case, it is alleged that Kabura, businessman Ben Gethi and eight others between December 2014 and May 30, 2015 engaged in an arrangement for the transfer of Sh90 million to an account at K-Rep Bank belonging to one Patrick Ogolla Onyango and Company Advocates. The prosecution said that Kabura, John Kago Ndungu and Ogolla transferred the money while knowing it was proceeds of crime stolen from NYS. The effect was to conceal the source of money.
