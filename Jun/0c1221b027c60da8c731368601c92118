Makueni Governor Prof. Kivutha Kibwana has said that negative ethnicity is a deceptive idea. Kibwana said that we are all one tribe which is Kenyan, and everyone deserves equal development. He went on to say that in the 1960s and the years that followed, Kenyans were sold a lie thatÂ a certain tribe could not rule the country because their men were uncircumcised. "The 'Handshake' has debunked this huge political lie. Our crusade against FGM and pursuit of gender parity in elective leadership further buries the same age-old myth," Kibwana tweeted on Wednesday. The second time governor stated that another lie was told after the 2007/8 post-election violence that the two warring tribes at the time - Kikuyu and Kalenjin-could never unite, even for political purposes, but this was proven wrong in 2013 and 2017. "Their leaders brought the two peoples together. Negative Ethnicity is an illusion," Kibwana said. "Ethnic kingpins, negative ethnicity, mtu wetu-kabila yetu, It is our tribe's turn, tyranny of numbers, tribal coalitions, regional political party, ethnic toxic politics Can 46 tribes defer to positive cultural expression & the glorious Tribe of One Kenya?" Kibwana posed.
