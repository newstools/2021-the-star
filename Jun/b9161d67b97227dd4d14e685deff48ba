Chief Justice Martha Koome  pledged on Wednesday to stay the course of the Judiciary transformation initiated by her predecessor. Koome, who spoke in Kisumu, said her vision as the head of  the third arm of government would not be different from that of former justices Willy Mutunga and David Maraga. "I have had sessions with the court users committee to explain my vision to them as CJ," she said. Speaking just a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta discredited the High Court ruling that blocked the BBI path, Koome said that her vision will not be different from what was developed by  Mutunga who came up with the Judiciary transformation framework that laid the foundation for reforms. "It is not different from that of immediate former CJ Maraga pertaining to  Judiciary transformation that focused on delivery of justice," she said. She added, "My only departure is that mine will be a bottom-up approach". Uhuru made the hard hitting comments against the Jjudiciary in the presence of the CJ during Madaraka day celebrations in the lakeside City on Tuesday. On Wednesday , Koome noted that as the CJ, she will share power with all the actors in the justice delivery system. " I share power. I am the CJ but I share the power of the office I am holding horizontally and vertically with all actors who are given power to administer justice," said Koome. She asserted that what happens in the magistrate court, the way the court is run is how the Supreme Court where she's the president,  will be run. " We set the same standards for delivery of justice, from bottom- up and if we are able to deliver justice from that position of the lowest point, then we will have less problems up in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal or the High Court," she said. She had earlier met judges, magistrates and the leadership and management of the Kisumu law court to explain to them her vision.
