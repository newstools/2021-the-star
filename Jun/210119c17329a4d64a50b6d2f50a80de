The electoral agency should ensure aspirants for political office have integrity instead of requiring they hold university degrees, a Meru MCA has said. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chair Wafula Chebukati said this week they will implement a section of electoral laws on the degree requirement. Implementation of Section 22 of the Elections Act was suspended to allow MCA and MP aspirants to get the qualifications. Meru county assembly majority leader Victor Karithi Tuesday said he was dismayed by Chebukati's directive. “We consider this to be very unfair, I think it can be contested in a court of law. In my view it is against human rights because only 2.5 per cent of the population have degrees,” Karithi said. The majority leader said the law needs to be interrogated further because it’s not fair. “There are people who even qualified for universities but because of various reasons were not able to, is it unfair to deny them an opportunity. Is it not rocket science to understand there are people who have an inborn ability to lead,” he said. Karithi said their caucus of MCAs thinks integrity should be a priority over academic qualification. He said he is not advocating for illiteracy, but thinks there are many support staff that can help out legislators in both county and national assemblies. “We have monies from taxpayers which pay researchers, lawyers and other staff in each of the 47 counties. I think if one has a Form 4 certificate and a certificate or college diploma, the individual is good to go,” Karithi said. “We should not gag people's right to make choices, masters and bachelors degree holders should be allowed to compete with those that have lower academic qualifications,” he said. This law has not been seen to work elsewhere, and there are several internationally renown leaders who did not have degrees, he said. “We have Tom Mboya and many others,” Karithi said.
