Mt Kenya leaders seeking to represent the region nationally have been urged to unite ahead of the 2022 elections. Mt Kenya Youth Caucus chair Linford Mutembei said on Wednesday the competition for Mt Kenya leadership was healthy, but it should not divide the region. Mutembei said the youth have held talks with 2017 presidential candidate Peter Kenneth and Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya about Mt Kenya unity. The Mt Kenya Youth Caucus officials said the duo is best placed to take over the region's leadership once President Uhuru Kenyatta leaves office. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi was last month coronated by elders as Mt Kenya spokesperson, a move that received support from some leaders and criticism from others. Former Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri, governors Mwangi Wa Iria (Murang'a), Anne Waiguru (Kirinyaga) and former Kiambu county chief William Kabogo have also received backing from some elders, governors and lawmakers from Mt Kenya East. Mutembei said Kenneth and Munya already have national following, but the other candidates are struggling to make a name beyond their respective counties. Leaders from Mt Kenya East, Mutembei said, should not trivialise the region by starting new political parties but join outfits that already have nationwide structures.   (edited by o. owino)
