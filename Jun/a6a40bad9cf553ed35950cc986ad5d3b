Football Kenya Federation on Saturday halted competition in all regions recently flagged by the Ministry of Health as Covid-19 red zones. In a press release signed by chief executive officer Barry Otieno, FKF said the suspension, which takes effect immediately, would last for an entire month as a cautionary measure. The letter read in part: “Reference is made to the Ministry of Health directive dated June 17, 2021, with regard to the developing Covid-19 situation in the country, which led to the suspension of sporting activities in Busia, Vihiga, Kisii, Nyamira, Kakamega, Kericho, Bomet, Bungoma, Trans-Nzoia, Kisumu, Siaya, Homa-Bay and Migori Counties.” “In light of the foregoing, and the urgent need to mitigate the spread of the Covid- 19 pandemic in the aforementioned 13 Counties, the federation has with immediate effect, suspended all FKF Women Division 1, FKF Division 1 & 2, Regional, County and Sub County leagues, as well as all grassroots football programs in the said Counties for a period of thirty (30) days.” For the avoidance of doubt, said FKF, leagues in counties not affected by the government directive would go on as scheduled, in line with existing FKF/CAF and government Covid 19 protocols. “Additionally, the federation will continue to engage the government with a view of having BetKing Premier League Clubs, Betika National Super League clubs and BetKing Division One clubs from the affected 13 Counties play their home matches in neighboring Counties.”
