The National Council of Churches of Kenya Turkana chapter has urged women in the county to play an active role in politics and seek leadership positions. Speaking in Lodwar following an NCCK training to empower women to participate in politics, Turkana NCCK chairman Samson Akoru said more than 400 women in the county have been trained with 50 of them ready to vie for elective seats. “We seek to mentor and encourage women to take up leadership positions. For many years, women have not been allowed to participate in politics, theirs is only to vote,” Akoru said. He said there is a need for women to fully participate in governance and  not be spectators. Akoru said women should be empowered so that they can go for elective positions and play a part in developing their areas. Nominated MCA Zainabu Lokaale said the training will help women realise their potential and participate in politics. “Women play a vital role in the community. If you teach a woman to farm, the whole society will eat. We have been trained and we are ready to take up the challenge. We have strategies to ensure women get elective seats come 2022,” she said. She said they will push for the “He for She” plan where when a man goes for the governor seat his deputy must be a woman. “Women should empower each other and advocate for greater representation of women in leadership in the public sector. He for She plan must apply for gender equality. We will also mobilise for resources through our initiatives and campaign for them,” Akoru said. Women decried low representation  in county assembly of Turkana saying only one women was elected. In the 2017 general election, Leah Nachere who has not undergone any formal education and only speaks Turkana language was elected by  Lake Zone ward voters in Turkana North. Nachere emerged the victor in the August 8 polls and is representing the pastoralist community in the county assembly. -Edited by SKanyara
