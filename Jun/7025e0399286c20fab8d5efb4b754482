Mukurwe wa Nyagathanga in Murang’a county, also known as the ‘mythical Garden of Eden’ of the Kikuyu tribe’, was a busy place last weekend. A faction of the Kikuyu Council of Elders converged there to cleanse. Apparently, another section of the council recently ‘defiled’ the shrine by coronating National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi as the Mt Kenya region spokesperson. You see, once upon a time every community had a respected council of elders. In the land of Odera Kango and Luanda Magere, there was the Luo Council of Elders. Each community had its version of the ‘Council of Elders’. This was until elderpreneurship happened. The Council of Elders as they were known then stopped to be. Elderpreneurship became a lucrative occupation. The political class became the most coveted client. Community eldership became a commodity that any politician with coins, and they have lots of them, can buy. A politician could therefore buy eldership to most of the major communities in Kenya for political expediency. Offers and counter-offers are made by various factions of the elders. Coronation and cleansing have become major products in the elderpreneurship market. When they coronate, we cleanse. When they cleanse, we coronate. A very lucrative business. Elderpreneurship.
