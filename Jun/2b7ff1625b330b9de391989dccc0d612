The case against Josephine Kabura and others over the loss of Sh791 million at the National Youth Service failed to proceed on Monday because one accused had not hired a lawyer. The matter had been listed for hearing, with nine witnesses lined up to testify. But chief magistrate Martha Mutuku adjourned the case to Wednesday to allow Samuel Mudanyi to get an advocate following the death his lawyer Joseph Wagara on May 10. Ben Gethi, Kabura and nine others were charged afresh in 2019 over graft and money laundering claims. They all pleaded not guilty to the amended charges and are out on bail of Sh300,000 each. In the new charge sheet, the prosecution added a fresh count against Kabura, John Kago Ndung'u and Patrick Ogola Onyango. The particulars of that count indicate that between December 1, 2014, and May 30, 2015, in Nairobi, the three accused engaged in an arrangement for the transfer of Sh90 million into a K-Rep Bank account belonging to Patrick Ogolla Onyango T/A Ogola and Company Advocates while knowing or ought to have known the money was proceeds of crime, having been stolen from NYS. The prosecution alleged that the effect was to conceal the source of the Sh791 million. Also amended are the dates for the offenses. It is alleged that the said offences in the charge sheet were committed between December 2014 and April 2015. The accused were first arraigned in 2016 and were charged with 15 counts.  Edited by P.O
