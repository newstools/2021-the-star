@robertomollo3 Homa Bay executive for sports and tourism Frederick Odero who had been impeached by MCAs has now been sacked. His sacking follows a court decision that upheld the 2019 impeachment. Governor Cyprian Awiti communicated Odero's sacking in a letter authored by county secretary Isaiah Ogwe. Odero has been impeached for alleged gross misconduct, incompetence, abuse of office and corruption. Awiti said he reached the decision after residents, through their ward representatives, expressed no confidence in his services. An ad hoc committee of the county assembly chaired by Rusinga MCA Okuku Miregi had in May 2019 recommended to the governor to fire Odero over abuse of office. On Friday, Awiti directed Odero to vacate office with immediate effect. In the letter, Ogwe said Odero's sacking was informed by a decision of the  Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kisumu that upheld his impeachment. The court had previously issued a stay order that allowed the executive to continue serving. Odero was directed to hand over to his chief officer Moses Buriri as the governor looks for his replacement. “Proceed to hand over all government property and necessary information for the running of the department to the chief officer,” the letter said. The letter was copied to county assembly speaker Elizabeth Ayoo. MCAs had said the majority of residents had lost trust in Odero as the executive for sports and tourism. “In absence of any order to the contrary, I write to convey the decision of Governor Awiti that in compliance with the county assembly's decision, you are dismissed from holding the position of county executive committee member for sports and tourism with effect from the date of this letter,” the letter dated Friday, June 18 reads.
