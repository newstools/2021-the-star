A South African woman has given birth to 10 babies, possibly breaking the world's record of largest-ever live births if doctors confirm there are no complications. Thirty -seven year old Gosiame Thamara Sithole, claimed to have given birth to 10 babies all at once at a hospital in Pretoria, according to the Mirror. According to her husband, Tebogo Tsotetsi, the babies, seven boys and three girls were delivered by a caesarean section on June 7. This comes a month after a woman named Halima Cisse from Mali gave birth to nine babies in Morocco. Sithole was initially thought to be carrying six babies but later doctors found out that she is to give birth to eight babies. Doctors only realised that she was pregnant with 10 babies only after the surgery was done. Gosiame Sithole and her husband Tsotetsi are already parents to six-year-old twins. The father to the decuplets, though unemployed, expressed his excitement over his bundles of joy. "It is seven boys and three girls. She was seven months and seven days pregnant. I am happy. I am emotional. I can’t talk much," he said:
