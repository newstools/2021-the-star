Reigning Africa Under-18 3,000m champion Zena Chemutai is keen to make the cut for the  Kenyan team to the World Athletics Under-20 Championships set for  August 17-22 at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. In her last year as a junior runner, Chemutai will be the key highlight at next weekend’s Under-20 pre-trials for the North Rift region at the Tambach Teachers Training College in Elgeyo Marakwet county. “My training has been going on well under my coach (Erick Kimaiyo) in preparation for the championships. I have been doing well and making the team will be my biggest dream,” said Chemutai. After missing out on a medal at the 2018 World under-20 Championships in Tampere, Finland, Chemutai says she will be satisfied with a podium finish on home soil. “I have been training well for the World U-20 show and right now I am at my peak. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, my training program has been smooth,” Chemutai, who has been training at the Lornah Kiplagat Track in Iten, said. She is also positive Kenya will retain the overall title they won three years ago in Finland. She started her running career while in standard six at Kapchpso Primary school and first represented the country at the 2018 World Under-20 Championships. Her coach, Kimaiyo, described her as a dedicated athlete with the potential to do well at the under-20 championships as well as within the senior ranks. “I trust she will be a great runner both in her junior and senior ranks. I have worked with her and my ambition is to see her prosper,” said Kimaiyo. Kimaiyo added that he will be sending four junior runners to the pre-trials to gauge them ahead of the national trials.
