He had climbed a tree to trim it when one of the cut branches fell on a live power cable and touched Ochieng'.

Kasewe A assistant chief Dickson Samba said neighbours tried to run and rescue the boy but in vain. Samba urged residents to consult Kenya Power whenever they want to cut or trim trees which are planted near electricity power lines. “We shouldn’t lose anymore life on things which are preventable. Parents shouldn’t direct their children to engage in home-based activities which are dangerous to life,” Samba said. The administrator said they reported that matter to Othoro police station for investigations. He said they were talking to Kenya Power officials to trim tree branches that grow near electricity lines. The body of the deceased was taken to the Okita Nursing Home mortuary in Kadongo trading centre.
