One of the parachuters from the Kenya Air Force was injured during the 58th Madaraka Day celebrations held at the Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in Kisumu. After the airshow display in front of President Uhuru Kenyatta and other dignitaries, the parachuters showcased their prowess as they landed at the stadium. However, one of them landed awkwardly forcing a prompt response by the paramedics who loaded him into an on-waiting ambulance. Photos by Daniel Ogendo
