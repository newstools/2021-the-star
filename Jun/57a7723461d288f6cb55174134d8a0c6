A suspect linked with the murder of a 19-year-old girl will be detained for three days pending investigations. Robert Kitsao is being probed for the murder of Najma Abdallah who went missing from her sister’s house, only for her body to be found at Portreiz Hospital where she had been undergoing treatment. The hospital said Najma had been found by passersby along Dongo Kundu bypass before she was taken to the hospital but succumbed to her injuries. Senior resident magistrate Rita Amwayi directed the suspect be detained at the Changamwe police station. The state told court it had yet to complete investigations into the links between the suspect and the murder of the teenager. State counsel Barbara Sombo said Kitsao was a tuktuk driver whose vehicle was seen on the scene a few minutes after Najma was found unconscious by good Samaritans. Sombo said Kitsao’s tuktuk was captured by weighbridge CCTV cameras to have made a U-turn at the same spot the deceased had been found. The court heard that Kitsao fits the description given by key witnesses as the driver of the tuktuk. The police are waiting for a report from the Cybercrime Unit on key evidential scripts collected along the Dongu-kundu route. Sombo said the report will assist the investigators to link the suspect to the crime scene. The prosecution further said it intends to collect call data of the suspect’s mobile phone on the date when his tuktuk was captured at the crime scene. The police intend to hold an identification parade for the key witnesses. Kitsao is the second suspect to be detained in connection with the death of Najma. Another suspect, Faiza Ali Hassan, who was Najma’s friend, was arraigned before she was released unconditionally. The police had claimed that Hassan was the last person seen with Najma on the evening of June 9, the day she went missing. -Edited by SKanyara
