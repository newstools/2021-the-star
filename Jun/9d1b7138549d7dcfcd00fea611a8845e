The International Monetary Fund will extend its aid to Tanzania as the East African country battles the Covid-19 pandemic. The announcement was made by Abebe Aemro Selassie who is the IMF African Department Director. Selassie held discussions with the Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan on Tuesday during a visit to the Kenyan neighbour. According to Selassie, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said that the institution would continue to work with Tanzania to achieve its development goals. He added that IMF is ready to work with Tanzanian experts in developing a plan that will see it get financial assistance from the lender to help it deal with Covid-19 effects. IMF will also help Tanzania to rebuild its economy devastated by the pandemic by focusing on the tourism sector as well as health. Suluhu expressed her gratitude to IMF for working closely with her administration in ensuring that the country develops. This came as Tanzania opened its doors to the international and local organisations to facilitate the issuance of the Covid-19 vaccines to Tanzanians in line with the guidelines issued by the country's Ministry of Health. The government has also allowed citizens to be vaccinated at their will, more so those working in the business sector. It has been a hundred days since Suluhu assumed office and one of the hailed achievements is accepting that the pandemic is also ravaging Tanzania, unlike her predecessor Jon Magufuli who denied it. Suluhu has also collaborated with other leaders from the East Africa Community in fighting the deadly pandemic. During her visit to Kenya in May, Suluhu called for concerted efforts in dealing with the global health challenge. The president had promised that her administration would implement the recommendations of a taskforce formed to evaluate the effects of the pandemic.
