The Kisumu government has released Sh45 million bursary cash to benefit 9,772 needy students in high schools. Deputy Governor Mathews Owili said the selection of beneficiaries was aboveboard. "Applicants are diligently scrutinised by non-partisan ward bursary committees, who in turn send the evaluation forms to the county’s department of education," he said. Owili said the county has put in place committees to look into any complaints or grievances. "We are kicking off the exercise this morning by sending Sh12,492,00 to Nyakach subcounty. The rest of the subcounties will follow suit," he said. Owili appealed to students who will be getting the bursaries to study hard, pass their examinations and fulfil their dreams. "This, I hope, is the best way to pay back the taxpayers," he said. The disbursement brings to Sh160 million the amount the county has given out as bursaries and scholarships to students in schools, universities, tertiary colleges and driving schools in the past two years. "As you can recall, in January this year, we gave out Sh57,230,025 as scholarships to 1,260 beneficiaries in universities and driving schools," the deputy governor said. Owili said these bursaries and scholarships have changed the lives of many needy students who have been desperately seeking assistance to enable them to pursue their education. "But we are not stopping here, because our children must go to schools and become the cornerstone of this great county.  As our governor has always said, every student in this county must be helped to cherish and realise his or her dream."
