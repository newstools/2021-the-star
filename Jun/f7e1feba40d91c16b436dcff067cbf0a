After setting a new national record of 10.02, sprints sensation Ferdinand Omanyala is already dreaming of running  under 10 seconds. Omanyala was in seventh heaven after he won the men's 100m final at the national trials for the Tokyo Olympics, ahead of previous record holder Mark Otieno (10.05) and Ugandan Benson Okot (10.51) in second and third respectively. "The false starts made it happen. I was planning for a sub-10 but that will come later. I've worked the whole Covid-19 break without competition and it has finally paid off. We have been competing against each other (Otieno) in the few races we have had and it is great that we have made it together," Omanyala said. Before yesterday's final, Otieno had defeated Omanyala in their previous encounters — the latest being the exhilarating final at the Athletics Kenya track and field weekend meeting at Moi Stadium, Kasarani in March this year. Both sprinters have qualified for the July 23-August 8 Olympics and Otieno was equally elated to be gracing the grand stage after missing out on the Rio Olympics, five years ago. "I am happy that the two of us have made it. It has been a long journey. God has come at the right time. I have been looking for this since January. The false starts made me nervous but we cannot argue with technology. Ferdinand is good and we need such pressure to make it to such high level competition. I missed Rio but I had a dream and surely God has come at the right time. It is amazing that I ran in borrowed spikes," Otieno said. The former national record holder has been grappling with a hamstring issue and had missed out on the Olympics pre-trials, held at the Nyayo Stadium a fortnight ago. AK president Jack Tuwei congratulated both athletes for their success and said it was a memorable day to have two sprinters qualify for Tokyo considering Kenya's past struggles in the race. In the women's 1,500m  final, Faith Kipyegon continued her great streak on the track as she timed 4:02.10 to cross the finish line first and earn her seat on the plane to Tokyo. Winny Chebet narrowly missed out on the quadrennial games, finishing second in 4:04.62 — 42 seconds shy of the qualifying mark of 4:04.20 — whereas Edinah Jebitok finished third in 4:05.54. Kipyegon has now firmly set sights defending her Olympic title and adding another gold to her medal collection. "My focus is to defend my Olympic title in Tokyo. It was a really good race here, which I really wanted to win. I know I will meet many good athletes in Tokyo but I have prepared really well," she said. In the women's 5,000m final, eight athletes secured passage to Tokyo, led by Lillian Kasait who clocked 14:52.18 to finish first ahead of world champion Hellen Obiri (14:52.51) and Agnes Tirop (14:53.91). "I am happy to qualify for my first Olympics. I didn’t expect to win because I was up against a very strong line up. I didn’t have many races but my preparations was uninterrupted. I know we have a strong team to defend our title in Tokyo," Kasait said. Others who have attained the qualifying mark of 15:10.00 include Margaret Chelimo (14:58.61), Beatrice Chebet (15:01.86), Mercy Cherono (15:02.42), Naomi Chepngeno (15:03.73) and Agnes Chebet (15:07.34). The three-day event continues today with more finals on the card including 4oom (men and women), 400m hurdles (men and women) and the 4x400m mixed relay.
