Hamisa Mobetto has confirmed that Diamond Platnumz does not visit their son at her house. This is because she pays her own rent and doesn't allow men into her home. Speaking to Tanzanian media, Mobetto added that she lives with her mum, the more reason she refuses to let men into her home. When asked whether Diamond goes to visit his son, she said, "In my house? No. As long as I pay my own rent, I don't allow men. I also live with my mother and for someone to come into my house, that person must have a valid reason." Adding, "But Diamond sees his son, the driver drives him to his house." Hamisa also confirmed that the singer gives child support for his son Daylan Abdul.
