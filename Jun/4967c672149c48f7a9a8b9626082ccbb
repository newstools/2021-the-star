Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago says voter education by the IEBC is critical to ensuring good management of free and fair elections as the country heads to the 2022 polls. The IEBC is going on with the voter education week. Mandago said Kenyans must be educated on the need to register as voters and participate in polls in order to determine the leadership they want for the country. “As we head to elections it is important that the IEBC should ensure it educates Kenyans using all means possible so that we all understand the elections process”, Mandago said. The governor said his county and others in the region will ensure peace prevails during the polls. Mandago spoke when he launched the voter education exercise being conducted in the county and across the country by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. The exercise comes ahead of the 2022 General Election, which is about 13 months away. Speaking during the event held at the county headquarters in Eldoret town, Mandago called on the voters to actively engage in the exercise so as to be well-informed about the elections process. The governor said leaders from the region have planned to hold a session with IEBC to discuss how best to engage all stakeholders including elected leaders and aspirants. "We want to encourage citizens that voter education will enlighten Kenyans. They  should also know that voter registration is ongoing at the subcounty level and we hope the process can be made available at ward level," Mandago said. He called on Kenyans who are eligible to vote to ensure they register as voters so that they participate in deciding the next leaders when elections are held in August next year. "It is important to vote, and even when you don't vote, you will have made a decision to allow a bad leader to win," he said. IEBC Uasin Gishu county election manager Jane Gitonga challenged locals to come out and engage the commission during the voter education week.
