Tejveer Rai has crashed out of the Safari Rally after his VW Polo nosedived on the dusty Kedong stage. Sources said, the Kabras Sugar Racing driver was later airlifted to Nairobi for specialized treatment. Tej, as he is fondly known to his fans, kissed the Safari goodbye on the same stage which claimed WRC stats Elfyn Evans (Toyota) and Dani Sordo (Hyundai). Tej is the current leader of the Kenya National Rally Championship ahead of his teammate Baldev Chager and Onkar Rai. It was a bitter pill to swallow for Tej who finished second overall on the ARC equator Rally.
