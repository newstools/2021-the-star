Vihiga United FC head coach Mike Mururi wants his charges to stay focused on the remaining matches to avoid relegation. “We need to at least win six matches to evade relegation,” Mururi. He said the club management is working round the clock to ensure they are comfortable financially. He said the sponsors have promised to return in a big way in the 2021/2022 season as long as they survive the chop. “Currently, we are trying to utilize the available resources to see the team through the season," he added. A source within the club said they are in talks with a new sponsor but the official position will be announced once the deal is sealed. The club currently depends on the county whose support is not enough to run the team. Mururi was appointed to take over after the departure of Sammy Okoth who cited financial crisis. Currently, the club is position 16  on the KPL log with 12 points having played 18 matches. They have only won two matches, drawn six, and lost 10. Vihiga still have 14 matches to play against Nzoia, Bandari, Bidco, Mathare, Sofapaka, Wazito, Kariobangi Sharks, City Stars, Western Stima, Ulinzi Posta Rangers, AFC, KCB, and Kakamega Homeboyz. Mururi attributed the team's dismal show to poor morale and low exposure among the players. “Poor funding for the club has killed the morale of the players though the level of fitness is okay,” Mururi said.
