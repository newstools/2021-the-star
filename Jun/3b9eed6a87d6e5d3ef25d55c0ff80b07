Head teachers in Ndhiwa constituency have been asked not to send students home for school fees to reduce dropouts and teen pregnancy. MP Martin Owino said on Friday that a number of children from needy backgrounds in Ndhiwa have been forced to drop out of school for lack of fees. The MP said the NG-CDF office was committed to supporting the education of poor and vulnerable students. “Ndhiwa NG-CDF prioritises giving bursary to support bright but needy students. Let head teachers help us fight dropouts and teenage pregnancy by retaining students in schools,” Owino said. The legislator spoke in Malela, Kanyamwa Kologi ward, where he distributed cheques worth Sh28.65 million to school heads in Ndhiwa. The money includes Sh26.25 million bursaries and Sh2.4 million medical cover for students in secondary schools. Some 3,850 students in secondary schools, special schools, tertiary colleges and universities benefited from the bursary funds. The students hail from Kwabwai, Kanyadoto, Kanyikela, North Kabuoch, Kanyamwa Kosewe, Kanyamwa Kologi wards and South Kabuoch wards. The MP called on the government to send capitation funds to schools on time. “Covid-19 pandemic hit our economy hard and many parents do not have money. It is important if school principals avoid sending students home for school fees every now and again,” Owino added. “We are undertaking various activities to create an enabling environment for learning in our schools.” Parents whose children benefited, led by Jane Atieno, said the cost of living has gone up and it is difficult to afford school fees.
