The Kenya Forest Service is set to plant at least six million mangrove trees in Lamu county by the end of this month. KFS is collaborating with other conservation groups in the National Tree Planting Campaign to fight deforestation and improve mangrove forest cover in the region. More than 60 per cent of Kenya’s mangrove forest cover is in Lamu county. However, millions of mangrove trees have over the years been harvested, without replanting. In Lamu, mangrove logging is a key economic generator, fetching over Sh5 million in monthly returns. Lamu KFS Conservator Evans Maneno said on Sunday that 5.5 million trees have been planted in Kililana, Kwasasi, Manda, Maganga, Mkunumbi, Wiyoni, Matondoni and Pate Island. Key players in the tree-planting campaign include the Kenya Wildlife Service, Eden Rehabilitation Project, Pate Conservancy and Kenya Forest Research Institute. Others are , Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, Northern Range Trust, the Fisheries department, Women Conservation Groups, National Employment Agency and Coast Development. Maneno said illegal logging is a major headache in maintaining the required forest cover in the region. “The tree planting campaign has been going on. By May, we had done five million plus trees. Our target is to plant six million trees by the end of June. Once we achieve that, we shall set a new target and start again. The point is to recover the lost cover by all means,” he said. Mangroves are an integral part of the ecosystem in Lamu and other coastal counties, as they provide breeding grounds for fish. They also prevent floods, soak up carbon and provide home to thousands of marine species.
