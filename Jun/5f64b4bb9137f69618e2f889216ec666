Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has been summoned by the Senate Committee on Health, to respond to audit queries on Covid-19 funds. The Committee chaired by  Senator Abdullahi Ali on Wednesday resolved to summon Governor Wangamati who failed to appear before it for the second time in a row. Wangamati was invited by the Committee to re-appear before it on Tuesday after a botched meeting on May 31 since his responses and accompanying documents had not been received and reviewed by the Auditor-General’s Office. The committee accused the governor of presenting 'frivolous' excuses and guilty of “treatment of the Senate with contempt.” Bungoma Senator, Moses Wetang'ula who appeared as a friend of the Committee said that the Senate cannot play second fiddle to the Council of Governors meetings and funerals that the Governor alleged to be attending. "We shall implement the full extent of the law including the possibility of sanctions and fines which the Senate is at liberty to impose," Wetang'ula said. The Committee will be issuing summons for Wangamati to appear before it physically upon the expiry of seven days, after seeking leave of the Speaker. Wangamati risks being arrested or fined five hundred thousand shillings if he fails to appear before the committee.
