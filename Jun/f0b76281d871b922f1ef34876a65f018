Africa is working with the European Union and other partners to help create regional vaccine manufacturing hubs in South Africa, Senegal, and Rwanda. Nigeria is under consideration, World Trade Organisation Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said. "We have now seen that over-centralisation of vaccine production capacity is incompatible with equitable access in a crisis situation," Okonjo-Iweala said on Monday during a virtual meeting. "Regional production hubs, in tandem with open supply chains, offer a more promising path to preparedness for the future health crisis."
