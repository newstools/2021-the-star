Musicians Wahu and Nameless have always stood out as a super couple in the showbiz industry. Speaking on the latest episode of their their reality show 'This Love', Wahu said at some point while dating, she asked to end the relationship. "I have always been born again and of course with my friends, they did not like the fact that he was not saved also, one time I told him it was over." Wahu said having been raised in a Christian family, where they went to church on Sundays, she always knew it is important to have a closer relationship with God. "When I met him back in college, I asked him if he was saved and he told me, 'No, I am not saved.' He told me, 'Frankly, I don't know if I can ever be saved'." Wahu was disappointed that the man who wanted to date her didn't believe in what she treasured most, and that led to some point of depression. "I really needed my space so I got into journaling." One day, Nameless visited her in her room while in college. She went to take a shower and Nameless stumbled on her diary. "I was so tempted to read it. I found out what was troubling her. I found a place she was talking about how she has been struggling because she believed in one thing and the guy she likes is not on the same page as her." Nameless added that he was fine to find out that Wahu was struggling with something she believed in and not a man. "I was competing with Jesus and not any other man in her life." At that point, Wahu told him it was over and it was such a sad moment coz Nameless sat there for long, thinking, and he wrote on her journal. "I don't understand why you think I am not good enough for you. And he left."
