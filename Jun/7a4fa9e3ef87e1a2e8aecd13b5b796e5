After beating Murang’a Seal 2-1 in Round 20 of the National Super League on Tuesday, Shabana coach Robert Ojienda now says they are serious title contenders. “The win against Murang’a Seal is now behind us. We are now focusing on our next game against third-placed Vihiga Bullets on Monday next week. If we win our next two matches against Bullets and Kenya Police, I can confidently say we will be title contenders,” said the coach. Ojienda, who has steered the team from 10th to fourth on the log after two wins and a draw, however, warned his charges against getting carried away. Shabana have 30 points, seven behind log leaders Talanta FC. The Kisii-based side has, however, played one more game. Ojienda heaped praise on on-form Ivorian striker Abou Traore, who has scored two goals in the two games he has started. Fred Nyakundi scored Shabana’s winning goal. “Traore is a very good player. He created many chances and scored our opening goal. I hope he will continue working hard. I’m also happy that Nyakundi also scored after a long dry spell,” said the former Migori Youth tactician. Ojienda expressed his concerns over poor officiating and asked Football Kenya Federation to address the issue. “The match officials who handled our game against Murang’a Seal were openly biased. FKF should address this before it’s too late,” said a disappointed Ojienda. With Gusii Stadium closed for renovations, Shabana has been using Migori Stadium, Narok Stadium and Kericho Green Stadium as their alternative home ground.
