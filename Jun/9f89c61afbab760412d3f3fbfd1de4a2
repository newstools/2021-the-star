Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has claimed that ODM leader Raila Odinga had promised to support Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka in 2022. In a single tweet on Tuesday night, Kibwana said the two Nasa principals inked a pre-election pact that would have seen Raila conditionally back Kalonzo for the 2022 presidential contest. “Myself & @makaumutua witnessed an agreement between Raila and Kalonzo detailing that RAILA would support SK in 2022 if NASA won in 2017,” he said. “… and it was intact until '22. Previously, the five NASA chiefs had signed a similar MOU: Raila would support one under NASA if he won.” But Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr refuted his claims. “I read the said document. I didn’t see the word victory. Perhaps it is time Prof Mutua made this document public. The two of you know about parole evidence on written documents,” he said. Here are other comments; At former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile's burial this month, Kalonzo and Raila expressed willingness to work together and assured Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu they will unite. But they have since differed in public, with Kalonzo giving conditions. The Wiper leader, who was Raila's running mate in the 2013 and 2017 General Elections said he was not ready to play second fiddle to Raila again. Last week, Kalonzo said, "I would be stupid to support his [Raila] bid without any form of reciprocity.” Raila responded by asking his Wiper colleague to stop panicking and barking since "I am yet to declare I will run."
