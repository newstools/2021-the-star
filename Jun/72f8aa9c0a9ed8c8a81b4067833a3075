Football Kenya Federation has been challenged to source for sponsorship before unifying the women's Premier League next season. FKF is planning to merge the league — just one season after playing the game in the zonal format with teams still grappling with financial challenges. It was thought the regional format will help cut costs but the script has been the same, with teams dishing out walkovers. Ulinzi Stars coach Joseph Mwanza said there will be no need to unify the league if the federation cannot get financial backing from corporates, adding that it is the only way to make the league competitive and reward the efforts of the players. "I understand the league will be unified again. My plea to the federation is to ensure there's patronage from corporates. Clubs are burdened financially and running a team is expensive, based on logistics," he said. "There will be no value merging the league without sorting out the financial menace that has accosted teams throughout the season. If the federation will not have a sponsor on board next season, I will support the zonal format to go on. I know my players also need exposure and get outside Nairobi but the environment should be favourable." A decision in regards to the relegation criteria is yet to be made. Clubs are opposed to the idea of three teams being relegated from each zone but it is hoped a compromise will be arrived at. As it stands,  Zone 'A' trio of Kibera Soccer, Makolanders and Mathare are relegated alongside their Zone 'B' counterparts SEP Oyugis, Oserian and Eldoret Falcons. Two teams will be promoted to the top-tier league from Division One.
