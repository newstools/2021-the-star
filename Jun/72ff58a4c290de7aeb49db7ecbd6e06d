A Moi Gesusu High school dormitory on Tuesday night went up in flames destroying beddings and students' personal effects. No student was injured. Principal Lukas Matiko said 36 double decker beds were reduced to ashes. The fire started at 6.50pm, when the students were in class for preps. "We want the parents to be assured that all the students are safe," said Matiko. He said they have already made plans to help the affected students with beddings as investigations are conducted. A villager who was on her farm spotted the fire and raised the alarm before the teachers and the students put out the fire. At least three students are under investigation. One of them is still on the run. " We are currently talking to one student who had skipped the evening preps class to see if we can get any leads on the cause of the incident," Matiko said. This is the second fire at the school in eight years. More than 800 students sleep at the four-storey building.
