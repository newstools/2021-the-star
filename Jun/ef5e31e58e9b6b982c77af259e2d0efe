A motorist was on Tuesday evening shot and killed after a three-man gang sprayed his vehicle with bullets in Juja, Kiambu County. Witnesses said the lone occupant of a private Subaru Forester was diverting to Kenyatta Road, off the Thika Superhighway at about 4pm, when the gang opened fire. The suspects were apparently tracking the motorist on a motorcycle, police said. The incident attracted a huge crowd as locals gathered at the scene soon after the gunmen had escaped. A witness said the gunmen looked trained and aimed at the driver demobilising him. At least 10 bullets were fired at the car. Police denied they were involved.  A team that responded to the scene said they were yet to know the identity of the victim and those behind it. The officers said they are also yet to know the motive as it seems nothing was stolen from the male victim. Juja Directorate of Criminal Investigations Officer (DCIO) Richard Mwaura said they had been informed the attackers sped off after suspecting they had killed their target. “We don’t know the motive and his identity. We will know more as investigators work on the case,” he said. A search on the car the motorist was driving showed it belongs to a motor vehicle dealer. This shows it was either on hire or had been sold to an owner who was yet to transfer its ownership. Two months ago, a motorist was killed in Changamwe after unknown gunmen opened fire on his car. The attackers are yet to be found. The incidents raise alarm on the possible rise of criminal gangs. Meanwhile, a woman was shot and seriously wounded In Nairobi’s Eastleigh area before being robbed of an unknown amount of money. The woman was either coming from or headed for a bank when the shooting happened. Witnesses said she was shot in the hand and later rushed to the hospital. The gang escaped on foot in the crowded area. Police said they are pursuing the gang behind the incident.
