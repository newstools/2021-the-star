Multiagency teams were Wednesday mobilised to search for a 23-year-old woman who was kidnapped by unknown people from Kamukunji area, Nairobi. A photo of a woman believed to be Hafsa Mohamed Lukman went viral on social media, appearing to show she was being tortured by her captors. The family said the people holding Hafsa had made a ransom demand of Sh5 million or they would kill her. The captors sent a video to the family showing Hafsa badly injured on her face and her eyes covered by a piece of cloth. She was heard saying the captors wanted money from the family as a ransom before releasing her. “Nimeshikwa na wanataka pesa tafadhali mtume pesa (I have been kidnapped and they want money, please send the money),” she is heard saying in the video. One of the men holding her tells her in Somali to speak in Swahili. The family made a missing person report at California police station in Eastleigh on June 15, when she went missing. Police said the gang had been shifting bases within Kayole, Nairobi, while making the demands. Teams of police visited at least three sites that they thought the woman was being held in vain. Hafsa was last seen at her clothing shop in Kamukunji before her kidnapping at about 5pm. A family spokeswoman said they hoped police would get her. She said Hafsa had come from Mandera and they do not know why she was targeted. The incident came amid concerns among security officials the cases of kidnapping are on the rise. A meeting of security chiefs, regional and county commissioners on Wednesday said kidnapping is emerging as a leading threat to stability in the country ahead of the 2022 general elections.
