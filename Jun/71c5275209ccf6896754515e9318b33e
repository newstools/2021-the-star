The government has been urged to acquire enough vaccines to inoculate all Kenyans against Covid-19 to end curfews and enable the economy to recover fast. Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi said the government should not keep people in lockdown in the name of fighting the virus without vaccinating them. He said it’s time the national government should face this pandemic seriously and not leave the burden to counties that have no capacities to handle the virus. Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba said the government should suspend some projects and focus on the war on the virus. “There is no need for us to allocate billions of shillings to transport and infrastructure and other ministries or departments to facilitate their projects when Kenyans are dying left, right and centre,” he said. “Let’s put our resources in one basket and fight this pandemic.” Milemba said there is no need for the government to focus on the Big Four agenda and leave Kenyans to die from the virus. The two urged Health CS Mutahi Kagwe to source vaccines for Kenyans to ease the current situation. The two lawmakers spoke on Saturday at Anyole FM during a fundraiser for the  Dorcus Omenda. Omenda was a journalist at Anyole FM who succumbed at Masaba hospital after a short illness. The two lawmakers said there is no need to keep the nation in lockdowns when other nations have done with vaccinating their citizens.
