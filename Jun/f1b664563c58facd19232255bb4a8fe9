President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday received credentials from six ambassadors and high commissioners recently posted to Kenya. Half of the envoys will be residents in Kenya while the rest will be based in neighboring Ethiopia. Giovanna Valverde Stark (Costa Rica), Isatu Bundu (Sierra Leone) and Jeronimo Rosa Joao Chivavi (Mozambique) will be resident in Nairobi. The non-resident envoys are Nestor Alejandro Rosa Navarro (Uruguay), Jainaba Jagne (The Gambia), and Khadijetou Mbareck Fall (Mauritania). Uhuru, who was joined by Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua and Foreign Affairs Amb Macharia Kamau, welcomed the envoys to Nairobi and wished them a successful tour of duty in the country. Uhuru was in Addis Ababa on Tuesday for an official working visit where he was received by senior government officials, including Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. He was accompanied by Cabinet Secretaries Raychelle Omamo (Foreign Affairs) and Joe Mucheru (ICT). Meanwhile, Uhuru has told Ethiopians that the entry of Kenya's technology giant Safaricom will help transform their country by positively impacting most sectors of the 112 million population economy. Using the example of Safaricom's impact on the Kenyan economy over the years, Uhuru lauded Ethiopiaâ€™s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and his administration for choosing to liberalise the country's telecommunications sector. He spoke on Tuesday evening in Ethiopia during the issuance of an operating licence to the Safaricom-led Global Partnership for Ethiopia consortium which won a Sh91.8 billion bid to operate in the country.
