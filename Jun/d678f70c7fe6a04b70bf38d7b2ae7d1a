Diamond's baby mama Hamisa Mobetto and American rapper Rick Ross seem to be taking their friendship very seriously. Ross has been responding to Hamisa's posts on Instagram. When asked whether she is dating the rapper, Hamisa said in a past interview, 'We are just friends.' Well, in a new post, Rick Ross has asked Hamisa to move to the US, where he stays. Hamisa captioned a recent photo, "I'm not trying to be in a relationship, I'm trying to be in a Range Rover." Rick Ross commented, "You're moving to USA." In her response, the Tanzanian model-cum-singer said she was more than ready. "All my bags are packed. I'm ready." In a recent interview with Brett Berish, Hamisa said she would like to do a collabo with Rick Ross, given a chance to work with an American artiste. Rick Ross is one of the major promoters of Luc Belaire, a drink that brought Hamisa closer to Rick Ross through the Self-Made Interview.
