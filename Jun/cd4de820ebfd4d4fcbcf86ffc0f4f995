A ward rep aspirant from the Coast has faulted the announcement by the electoral agency that aspirants who do not have degrees will be locked out of the 2022 polls. On Monday, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati said the amended Section 22 of the Elections Act will be implemented from next year. The section requires aspirants eyeing the six elective seats to be degree holders from recognised institutions. The implementation of that section was postponed during the 2017 General Election to give room for aspirants contesting the MP and MCA seats to acquire the academic qualification. Pwani Ni Kenya chairman Alex Kasuku, who is eyeing the Kaloleni ward seat, said the move by the IEBC is ill-advised. He said the MCA position is not so complex as to require a certain level of academic qualification. “The degree issue is null and avoid. You cannot peg an individual’s performance on academic qualifications. In fact, most MPs and MCAs who are top performers do not have degrees,” Kasuku said. He said denying an individual the opportunity to vie for the MCA seat because of lack of a degree amounts to denying residents their civic right. The politician said he will mobilise residents to march to the IEBC headquarters to protest against the announcement. He also threatened to engage an eloquence of lawyers to challenge the directive in court. “I am going to challenge the matter in court. We shall mobilise about 20 lawyers and move to court to oppose that law,” Kasuku said. The Elections Act only makes it mandatory for the presidential aspirant and his/her running mate to have a degree. The same applies to those eyeing the governorship position. Edited by A.N
