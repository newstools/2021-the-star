Three people have been arrested in connection with the kidnapping of a 79-year-old man, that occurred on June 6, in Kitale. Grace Nyakundi, Samwel Makori and Richard Matunda were arrested on Tuesday night for kidnapping Kennedy Nyabwari. Nyabwari disappeared after setting off for Kisii, from his Kitale home at around 5:30 pm that day. He later called his wife at around 9 pm informing her that he would spend the night in Kitale town, before proceeding to Kisii early the following morning. DCI boss George Kinoti said when she called her husband the following day at around 4 pm, his phone went unanswered. "Later at around 8:30 pm, she received a call from strangers who informed her that they had held her husband captive and demanded a ransom of Sh2 million to secure his release," Kinoti said. Terrified, the woman called the DCI and informed them of her predicament. A team of detectives from the Special Service Unit and Crime Research & Intelligence Bureau, supported by investigators based in Kitale, was immediately mobilized to track down the kidnappers, who were demanding the ransom. "Under the cover of darkness, the detectives with stealth and precision rescued the man in the outskirts of Kitale town," Kinoti said. Kinoti said a motorbike used by the suspects to ferry the victim and a gunnysack used to blindfold the old man were also recovered. "Detectives are currently pursuing a third suspect identified as Jackson Atei. Should you have any information that may lead to the suspect’s arrest, please let us know through our anonymous toll-free line 0800722203," Kinoti said. Last week, DCI detectives arrested the main suspect linked to the kidnapping of a child in Murang'a. Charles King’ori alias Delvin Maina was arrested following a dramatic chase in the streets of Naivasha town. He is suspected of kidnapping four-year-old, Liam Ngucwa Mwangi, from his grandparents on June 2, 2021.
