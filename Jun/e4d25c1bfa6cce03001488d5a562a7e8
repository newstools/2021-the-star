Residents of Maella in Naivasha were in shock after a scorned husband went berserk and stabbed his wife more than 15 times, killing her on the spot. The man escaped during the Monday morning incident before members of the public caught up with him. The incident came barely two weeks after a taxi driver killed his girlfriend on Kayole estate by strangling her following a domestic feud. Earlier, a 32-woman was murdered and her body dumped in a water tank in Mai Mahiu following a row with her boyfriend. In the latest incident, the victim was in the company of her aunt in the agriculture-rich area when the suspect attacked. A witness, Solomon Muturi, said the suspect talked with the wife away from their aunt before turning against her. “He had come to convince the wife to return home but after she declined his offers he whipped out a knife and stabbed her over 15 times before running away,” he said. He said that the victim bled profusely and died as members of the public made efforts to rush her to hospital. And on Kayole estate, a mother of two was found dead in her house in what is suspected to be a case of gas-poisoning. Her two daughters were rescued by members of the public as police moved in to collect the body and open an inquest file. Lakeview MCA Simon Wanyoike said there was a pungent smell from the house, a pointer to what could have killed the middle-aged woman. “The two minors miraculously managed to survive while the mother died in her sleep and police have taken over the case,” he said. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed both cases, adding that the suspect in the murder case had been arrested. “The suspect will be charged with murder while in the second case we are waiting for a postmortem to determine the cause of death,” he said.
