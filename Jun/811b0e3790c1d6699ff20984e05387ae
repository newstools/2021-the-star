AU envoy Raila Odinga on Tuesday toured the Lebu Railway Station to understand the operations of the Addis-Djibouti Rail network. “The transport of cargo and passengers via rail is an important and worthy investment that must remain a core component of the infrastructure agenda in the region,” Raila said. “Happy to note that Kenya is paying attention to the revival of the sector.” The ODM party leader shared pictures of the tour as they keenly followed the proceedings of the rail network. Raila who is the African Union High Representative for Infrastructure Development is in Ethiopia for a ministerial meeting for the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport corridor. The ministerial meeting brings together stakeholders from relevant departments in the region to review the project’s progress. The former Prime Minister has urged other regional countries to support the project. In August 2019, the Lapsset Corridor Development Authority said a strong case had been made to the AU on the project’s strategic position to connect not only Ethiopia and South Sudan, but also connecting to Central African Republic and Cameroon, terminating at Port of Douala. Raila who met with the Lapsset Corridor Development Authority noted that the Lapsset corridor has the potential to boost Africa’s regional social-economic integration through infrastructure development and trade. Lapsset was launched in 2012 during former President Mwai Kibaki's regime. The Kenyan government is putting up the first three berths of the planned 32 berths at an estimated cost of Sh71.5 billion. The entire 32 berths are estimated to cost Sh319.8 billion.
