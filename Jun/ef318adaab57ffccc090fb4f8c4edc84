The security forces in Eswatini - formerly known as Swaziland - have clashed with protesters, who are demanding major constitutional reforms. Protests by mainly young people intensified over the weekend, despite a government ban on all demonstrations. The protesters have been calling for King Mswati to make way as part of democratic reforms, including free elections. There were unconfirmed reports that King Mswati may have fled the country as the protests intensified. South African state broadcaster SABC reported on the allegations. Eswatini is the last country in Africa with an absolute monarchy.
