AFC Leopards kept their dreams to return to the continental stage alive with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Tusker in Betway Cup Isaac Kipyegon converted from the spot in the 33rd minute to put Leopards ahead after Eugene Asike handled the ball in the area. Minutes later, Elvis Rupia had a chance to double the advantage but fumbled on his first touch after being neatly put through by Harrison Mwendwa. Clean through, just before the break, Henry Mejja thought he had drawn the brewers level. However, a hawk-eyed Jeff Oyemba in Leopards' goal made a sharp late save to deny the brewers a reason to celebrate. It was the best of three chances Tusker created in the highly charged first half that was generally accentuated by rough play. Jaffar Owiti began on the bench and Mwendwa made way for him midway through the second half, having made no impact. As the game wore on, Kevin Okoth twice found himself strategically placed to test Oyemba. Neither time did his rasping shots trouble the on-form custodian who put in a man of the match performance to register a clean sheet. In the 80th minute, Luke Namanda should have scored, his header glancing wide. Then in stoppage time, Apollo Otieno fired wide with Oyemba already sprawling on the ground. The victory notwithstanding, Leopards coach Aussim has cautioned his charges against resting on their laurels. “Romping to the semis is not enough. We need to focus on the ultimate match,” said Aussems. On the other hand Tusker coach Robert Matano said they were punished for not utilising their chances. Meanwhile, Equity Bank shook off their underdog tag heading into the match to turn tables on Bandari whom they pipped 1-0 at Ruaraka grounds. Sunday Katumba’s 56th minute effort was all it took to separate the sides at full-time.
