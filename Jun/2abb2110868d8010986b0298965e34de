Residents of Laikipia will for the next three days be sensitised to how to contain the spread of Covid-19 and save lives. Laikipia county commissioner Daniel Nyameti will lead the drive to push residents to adhere to social distancing, handwashing and other Ministry of Health guidelines. Nyameti said the government was worried about the spread of the pandemic, especially in Nyanza and Western regions. “We have banned political gatherings in the county so that the disease cannot spread further. Politics can wait,” Nyameti said. He said that people should wear face masks in public, wash hands, sanitise and maintain social distancing. “We are partnering with the department of Information in this campaign. We shall be going down into the villages to sensitise people,” Nyameti said.  (edited by o. owino)
