Renowned aviation company, 748 Air Services has said its daily flights from Nairobi to Kisumu will continue as scheduled. 748 Air Service Managing Director Moses Mwangi said new containment measures put by the government to manage a spike in Covid-19 infection rates within the country's Lake Basin region will not affect the airlines operations. “We would like to notify you that the measures do not affect our daily Flights to Kisumu," Mwangi said in a statement on Friday. “We will continue to operate as scheduled whilst adhering to COVID-19 containment measures on board all our flights. No meals or water will be served during the containment period," Chairman Ahmed Jibril said. The government on Thursday ordered that curfew hours will start from 7pm to 4am in the Lake region until further notice. All public gatherings have also been banned in Busia, Vihiga, Kisii, Nyamira, Kakamega, Kericho, Bomet, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay and Migori counties. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe who announced the directives said the 13 counties constituted 60 per cent of the national Covid-19 caseload. However, the government did not lock down the counties as was widely expected. “Except for essential and emergency services, movement between the hotspot zone and the rest of the country is strongly discouraged,” Kagwe said in a statement.
