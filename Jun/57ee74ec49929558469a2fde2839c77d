Rapper Brian Omollo, alias Khaligraph Jones, says his mother is a preacher of the gospel of Christ. Speaking in a recent interview with Massawe Japanni on Radio Jambo, the father of three said he was raised on a solid Christian foundation. "We were raised in church and even when I started music, I used to do gospel. Yes, exactly. My mother is in the ministry. She is a preacher," he said. "Even as we speak, she is still ministering in the church." A while ago after he released his album 'Testimony 1990', he shared a video with his mother in the studio, saying she had passed by to pray for the album to be more successful. "Mum's just passed by the studio to get her copy of the Testimony 1990 album, and she was really feeling track number two called 'Blessing'," he said. She also prayed for the album to be more successful." He then shared a video rapping along to the song 'Blessings' as his mother looked on. "How do you feel that beat, mum?" he asked her. "It is all about patience. Jesus has done it all for us. Lord, we give you praise. Thank you for all you have done," she responded. Khaligraph said it has taken his hard work to be successful in his music career. He lost his father a few years ago. He said becoming a dad has made him more disciplined. "I have to keep pushing for my family, which depends on me and so, I am proud of my journey." During the interview, he spoke about his new song. "'Nikwa ni Shoke' was never part of the plan. I did not even do it here, I recorded and shot it in my hotel room while in the States. Hii haikua kwa mpango yangu," he said. "When recording a song, I do not do it to chase hits, I just do whatever and sometimes, they turn out to be hits. My intention is just to supply people with good material. Hit or not, OG must be respected."
