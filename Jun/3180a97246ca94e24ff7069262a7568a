The 2021 NCBA Bank Golf Series resumes this weekend at the Par-72 Sigona Golf Club where over 200 home golfers are expected to take to the course. The event is the fourth edition of the bank’s 21-tournament series which teed off at the Thika Golf Club in January this year. It forms the return of the series which had taken a break following disruptions occasioned by Covid-19 Pandemic, which subsequently led to the rescheduling of three events on the series’ calendar. The resumption follows the issuance of Covid-19 health and safety protocols to guide competitive golf events in the country by the Kenya Golf Union, following similar directives by Kenya’s Ministry of Sports. As part of the event, NCBA Bank will conduct a tree planting exercise, in line with  ‘Change the Story’ initiative. Through the initiative, NCBA Bank will seek to encourage members across participating golf clubs to actively take up tree-planting  to attain 15 percent forest cover across the country by the year 2022. The series has so far been held at Thika, Vetlab, and Kitale Golf Clubs. As part of the series, the bank seeks to hold a two-day Junior Golf Series which will cater for upcoming golf talent between the age of 6-18 years. The junior series will feature events at Karen Country Club from August 23-2 and at the Muthaiga from December 9-10
