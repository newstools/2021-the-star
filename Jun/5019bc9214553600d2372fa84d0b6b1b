The Mombasa County Health department has raised concern over an alarming increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases in the region. This month alone, the county has already recorded 109 positive cases and six deaths. As of May 30, Mombasa had recorded a cumulative 11,618 positive cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic broke out. However, the number shot to 11,727 on Monday. In the first one week of June, an average of 16 people contracted Covid-19 and one person died from the disease daily, latest Mombasa County Covid-19 Situation Report number 101 shows. County health director of communication Richard Chacha said the numbers could be rising drastically because of the inter-counties travel and failure to observe Health ministry guidelines to curb the spread of the disease. “Some of the reasons Mombasa is experiencing a surge is because of inter-county travel, which we are not in control of, and reluctance to observe Ministry of Health regulations,” said Chacha. According to World Health Organisation, Kenya could face a fourth wave of Covid-19 next month. WHO has since urged the country and East African nations to boost critical care capacity because of the expected surge in numbers during the cold season. Since the first case in Kenya recorded in March last year, a total of 223 people have succumbed to complications related to the virus in Mombasa. Some 295 health workers have contracted the disease with three succumbing to complications related to the virus. On June 2, the county began administering the second jab of the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine, after over 26,206 got their first jab between March 9 and May 30. So far, 331 people have received the second dose of AstraZeneca jab. Out of the 331 people, 248 are health care workers, five are security officers, 12 teachers and 30 people who are above 58 years old.  -Edited by SKanyara
