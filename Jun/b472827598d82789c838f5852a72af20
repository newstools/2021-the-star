The IEBC on Tuesday launched its Strategic plan and the Election Operation Plan 2020-2024. It was on the second day of the Annual Voter Education Week (AVEW) which commenced on Monday at the Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi. IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati said the commission has now turned its focus towards the 2022 General Elections, the boundaries review and electoral activities that may arise in the intervening period. The documents contain a road map of electoral activities as well as key timelines and milestones to be achieved. Chebukati further said the commission will bring on board the Communications Authority. "We will have multiple servers if possible one for the media, one for the political parties, one for the candidates and one for the public. The issue of having one server will not be there in 2022," Chebukati said. "The authority will identify areas that do not have a 3G network so that we can communicate in advance and look for alternatives for transmitting results," he added. The UK has since pledged to provide financial support to the IEBC as it seeks to deliver on its mandate. Present at the event were Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju, NCIC chair Samuel Kobia, Chief Registrar of Judiciary Ann Amadi and Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu.
