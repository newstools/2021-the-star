A police officer is counting losses after his house caught fire at Soko Mjinga area in Lari subcounty, Kiambu, on Tuesday morning. The officer is housed at the Kinale assistant county commissioner Karanja Kimata’s office. The officer had returned from night patrol at Kinale village only to be woken up by residents trying to put out the fire that had engulfed his house. “We saw flames of fire billowing from the rooftops of the house. We then opened the door and he rushed outside. We salvaged a few items since the fire was being propelled by wind from neighbouring Kinale forest,” resident Charles Nyoro said. Nyoro said the officer was lucky he had not locked his house from inside, they woke him up as they were screaming looking for help. The block has four offices. One office is used by the area ACC while the rest house police officers. Lari subcounty police commander Stephen Kirui said they suspect the fire was caused by an electric fault. However, Lari deputy county commissioner Agnes Karoki said investigations to establish the cause of the fire are under way. Karoki said documents from the ACC’s office and furniture were rescued, adding that the ACC will continue to serve locals from the same facility. The DCC thanked members of the public for waking up early and hurriedly putting out the fire averting further damage. Former Kinale councillor Titus Kiratu asked area MP Jonah Mburu to move with speed to renovate the building, since they need services from the same officers. “We need to see our MP using the emergency fund in the CDF kitty to renovate this building. We still need the ACC and our police officers services,” he said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
