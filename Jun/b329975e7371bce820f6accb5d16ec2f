Police are investigating a case in which a woman is suspected to have hanged herself at AIC Kijabe Hospital at dawn on Monday after she was diagnosed with Covid-19. Detectives said the woman was admitted to the facility with different ailments on June 14. She was put in isolation after she tested positive for Covid-19. Lari DCI Eunice Maingi said the woman was alone in the isolation ward and she used a cloth to hang herself. She tied the cloth to a water pipe. Maingi said officers who visited the scene said there was no sign of struggle. “We ruled out that she was killed since there were signs of struggle,” she said. Subcounty police commander Stephen Kirui said they are treating the incident as suicide, adding that DCI officers are investigating. He said the woman could have been traumatised after she learnt she was suffering from Covid-19. Hospital staff and her family members have been asked to record statements at Kijabe police station as investigations continue. Edited by A.N
