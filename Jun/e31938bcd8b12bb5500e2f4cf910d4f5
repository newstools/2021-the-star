Denmark star midfielder Christian Eriksen received urgent medical attention after collapsing on the field during the first half of a UEFA Euro 2020 match against Finland on Saturday in Copenhagen. Medical staff immediately rushed the field and performed CPR in an attempt to resuscitate Eriksen. Denmark players formed a circle around the medical staff in a bid for privacy. There was no immediate word on Eriksen's condition. The match was stopped in the 43rd minute. UEFA later announced the match has been suspended due to medical emergency.
