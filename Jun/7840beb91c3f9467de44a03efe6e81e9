DJ Evolve has spoken out after rumours that he was dead spread on social media on Tuesday. The DJ has been bedridden since he was shot at Nairobi’s B-Club in January 2020. In a video that has since gone viral, DJ Evolve, who is bedridden, is seen looking jovial and upbeat. “Hello. To everyone saying DJ Evolve is dead. This is real-time...” says his brother who takes care of him as he turns the camera to show DJ Evolve. The spinmaster whispers in a raspy voice, “Who is dead?” His younger brother continues, “This is him, he is good, he is chilled, everything is good.” Evolve’s dad John Orinda has also rubbished the death claims. “Whatever I’m hearing is not right, it is not true. I was shocked to hear such reports. When we wake up every morning, the first thing is to check on our son, for now, he is faring well. “Everyone should just pray for him, because you have said you love him, pray for him to heal. Right now, your prayers are working. He can sit on his own for about one hour, then he is put back to sleep.” He told Word Is, “Evolve is doing fine. The device that was put in his throat is still there, he is not talking yet. “I have been called by another journalist asking about the same. Whoever is spreading that information is not a good person. “A person who can proclaim death on someone alive? What kind of a person is that? It is not good at all. I have called my son, who stays with him, and he is doing fine,” said Orinda. -Edited by SKanyara
