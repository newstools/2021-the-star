Education Cabinet Secretary, Prof George Magoha has launched Kenya's first Physical Education and Sport Policy for basic education. The CS launched the policy on Wednesday, at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development in an event attended by various stakeholders in Education. According to Magoha, the Ministry of Education will mainstream physical education and sports in all learning activities. "The implementation will go a long way in promoting realisation national goals of education. It's also aligned to the Competence Based Curriculum which provides arts and sport as one of the career pathways," Magoha said. He went on to say that the new policy recognises the passion with which the government holds sports and values the achievement realised in in sports over the years. Magoha promised to work with all relevant ministries and departments to implement new physical education and sports policy. This comes even as the country continues with the gradual rollout of the CBC, which puts emphasis on competencies and talents. The CBC perspective to education provides learners with 21st-century skills, such as collaborative learning, critical thinking, communication skills, and problem-solving. Under the curriculum, learners will join secondary school based on their performance in continuous assessment tests and a final test in Grade 6. Learners will spend two years in pre-primary education, six in primary, three in junior secondary, three in senior secondary school and another three in university. The move to the CBC from 8-4-4 system has also come with a lot of challenges from various groups including teacher unions, politicians and parents unions.
