President Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM leader Raila Odinga, the BBI Secretariat and the Attorney General have now filed formal appeals against the BBI judgement. A source privy to the matter says the President's appeal was served on Tuesday at 2.40 pm while in Kisumu for the Madaraka day celebrations. IEBC is also expected to follow suit and file the main appeal. Parties say the filing of the appeals may come with a change of strategy from the pro-BBI team. The pro-BBI team had filed applications for stay seeking orders stopping implementation of the high court judgment pending hearing of the appeals. This even as a three-judge bench is expected to sit today and give parties directions on how the case will proceed. However, a lawyer involved in the case says the focus may now shift to the main appeals and not the applications for stay. Application for stay are often filed to offer some interim comfort pending hearing of the main appeal. The respondents in the case have asked the president of the court of appeal to assign a seven-judge bench to hear the appeal. That's one of the issues that will come up today in court.
