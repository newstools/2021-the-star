A goal in first-half stoppage time by Aleksei Miranchuk got Russia’s Euro 2020 campaign back on track as they beat Finland 1-0 in Group ‘B’ on Wednesday. Joel Pohjanpalo thought he had given the Finns the lead in the fifth minute but his powerful header was ruled out for offside after a VAR review, and the rest of the first half was played at a high tempo. With both sides committing players forward in attack, Miranchuk popped up just before the break to curl in a superb left-footed effort to put his side in front. The Finns, who beat Denmark 1-0 at the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen on Saturday following Christian Eriksen’s on-field collapse, threw everything they had at their neighbours but struggled to hit the target as the Russians held on to win. Meanwhile, Austria forward Marko Arnautovic has been suspended by Uefa for one match after being found guilty of “insulting another player” in Sunday’s Euro 2020 win over North Macedonia. Arnautovic, who has Serbian heritage, had to be restrained by captain David Alaba as he celebrated his late goal. Arnautovic appeared to direct comments at opponents Egzon Bejtulai and Gjanni Alioski, who have Albanian roots. Arnautovic responded after the match by saying he is “not a racist”. The 32-year-old was found guilty of misconduct, with Uefa not considering his actions to be discriminatory. Arnautovic, who was born in Austria and has a Serbian father, apologised for his goal celebration in a post on Instagram. He wrote: “There were some heated words yesterday in the emotions of the game for which I would like to apologise, especially to my friends from North Macedonia and Albania.” “I would like to say one thing very clearly: I am not a racist. I have friends in almost every country and I stand for diversity. Everyone who knows me is aware of that.”
