A man was hacked to death at his employer’s home in Kantafu village in Matungulu, Machakos county on Monday night. Matungulu subcounty police commander Monicah Kimani said police are investigating the incident. Kimani said the man was a caretaker at the farm in Kantafu where his body was recovered. The attackers also stole a new motorcycle bought for the man by the employer. "The farm is 15km from the Kantafu market. The employer had acquired the motorbike to ease the man's commute," Kimani said. “An unknown number of people raided the farm and attacked him. They were looking for the motorbike.  A fight ensued which left the man with a cut on the head that lead to his death." The body was taken to Kangundo Level 4 Hospital mortuary. The incident happened barely a month after a night guard was hacked to death by robbers under similar circumstances nearby. Hudson Waifafu was killed at Rockland Garden Makuti restaurant in Joska, Matungulu subcounty on May 25. Residents faulted police laxity for the killing of the watchman who was at work that night. He was 62. The matter was reported to the KBC police station. A senior police officer at the station told the Star the DCI was investigating the matter. No suspects have been arrested.
