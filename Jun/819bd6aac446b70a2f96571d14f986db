Planning to go out this weekend? You will pay more for beer and an assortment of spirits and vodka as East African Breweries Limited (EABL) adjusts retail prices on its range of products. Beer-lovers will now pay between Sh5 and Sh20 more to enjoy some of the common brands in the market. Notable increases are in Whitecap Light,  Tusker Lite and Malt which have increased by Sh20 which takes the recommended retail price up from Sh160 to Sh180 for bottled and canned beers. A 500 ml of Guinness (regular), Whitecap Lager, Balozi,  Hop House 13 and Tusker Cider will cost Sh10 more with new prices ranging between Sh180-190, while that of  Hop House 13 goes up to Sh220. Most cans have also increased by between Sh10-Sh20. The price of bottled flagship beer–Tusker Lager however remains unchanged with its recommended retail price being retained at Sh160. That of Allsopps Lager, Guinness Smooth, Pilsner and Sikera(Apple) also remains unchanged. The recommended retail price of a Tusker Lager is Sh160 while that of Pilsner is Sh140. Consumers of Senator Keg also remain unaffected where prices will continue to range between Sh30 and Sh55 depending on the flavour and quantities of 300ml and 500ml "cups". Most of the common beer brands have however been retailing at between Sh200 and Sh350 at entertainment spots in the city and major towns, with some bar owners and clubs making more than 100 per cent profit. High end joints sale beers at between Sh550 and Sh800 and above, depending on the clientele and premises. Meanwhile, whisky, brandy, vodka, gin, liqueur and ready-to-drink consumers will also pay more for their favorite drinks where prices have increased by between Sh20 and Sh200. For instance a bottle of Johnnie Walker that has been retailing at Sh6,200 will now cost Sh6,400. EABL has based the price increase on a number of factors among them the impact of Covid-19 on its business and the tax environment in the country. "We haven't increased prices since 2019, despite the excise inflationary adjustment in 2020. We have absorbed costs over this period," management replied to an inquiry by the Star. There has also been a rise in fuel costs during the last two years which has driven the Kenya Breweries Limited operational costs up, it said on Friday. "During the Covid period we have also seen rising costs in our raw materials, specifically resulting from logistical challenges and inflation in the last year,"it said. The regional brewer says the government also took away the VAT and corporate tax incentives, despite continued restrictions in the trading environment. "Our industry has also been the most impacted by the Covid-19 disruption-bars and pubs have been operating on limited hours since March 2020," it says through its communication team.
