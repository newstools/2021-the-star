Over 95 health workers battling Covid-19 in Mombasa county were at the weekend feted for their good work. They were issued with certificates and packages of food as appreciation. The event, which was held at Aga Khan Hospital, was organised by the Rotary Club of Mombasa in partnership with the Jaffer Foundation. Each health worker was given a certificate and a 30kg sack of food. Health workers in Mombasa are among the hardest hit by Covid-19. At least 299 have contracted the disease. Three of them have died in the line of duty due to the disease. The president of the Rotary Club of Mombasa Abdulhamid Aboo, who is also a Covid-19 survivor, said his experience in hospital made him realise the sacrifices of health workers in fighting the pandemic. “I’m a Covid-19 survivor and I was in hospital for 11 days. I saw these brave men and women put their lives and those of their families at risk while attending to the infected,” Aboo said. He urged people to take the virus seriously by ensuring that they adhere to the Ministry of Health protocols set to curb the spread of the contagion. Agha Khan Hospital CEO Seyd Sohil said it was prudent for people to appreciate and acknowledge the sacrifices of all frontline workers. “The biggest lesson in this pandemic is that it is not only about the health sector but other sectors of the economy have also suffered,” he said. Sohil warned individuals who suspect to have contracted the virus to avoid self-medication, but seek proper medical attention from hospitals. Yusuf Jiwa, the chairman of Jaffer Foundation, said they have partnered with various hospitals within the Coast region to help in supporting efforts to curb the pandemic. Edited by Henry Makori
