A gang on Sunday raided the home of businessman Harish Patel in Nairobi's Muthaiga area and made away with money and jewellery of unknown value. Starehe police boss Julius Kiragu who led a team of officers to the scene said no one was injured during the Sunday evening robbery. Police and victims said the gang scaled a perimeter wall to the home along Tchui Road and held the family hostage at gunpoint. They first tied the guard on duty and three workers using ropes and locked them in a room. They then proceeded to the main house where they demanded cash and jewellery from owner Harish Patel. Kiragu said they believe the gang had prior information on the presence of the cash and gold in the house. Police are interrogating the workers as part of the probe into the 30-minute robbery ordeal. “We are following various leads that will help us arrest the gang of three whom we are told were armed with pistols,” Kiragu said. Preliminary findings showed the gang escaped by climbing a wall after making a ladder using tomato crates. A guard on duty said an alarm went off but there was no response from those inside. This forced the guards to seek help from police who scaled the wall to gain entry. They found the tied victims and those robbed terrified in their room. They were taken to hospital where they were checked and discharged. Tchui Road hosts some of the most affluent homes in Muthaiga, one of Nairobi's posh suburbs. Cases of robbery are becoming common in the area and are mainly an inside job. Police usually advise owners of homes to always vet their employees to avoid such incidents. Authorities also advise against keeping huge amounts of money in houses.  (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
