Kenya Lionesses coach George Mayinga said the combination of Dubai-based Rose Ouma and Vicky Wanjara at the back court will be key during the Fiba AfroBasket Zone Five qualifiers slated for Kigali, Rwanda from July 12-15. Mayinga said Ouma, who has trained for just a few days with the team since her arrival, looks sharp and her combination with Wanjara has been impressive. “Rose is in good shape. This team really needs a playmaker. I am sure her experience will help us a lot in that vital position,” said Mayienga Mayienga said Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) guard Natalie Akinyi is also in his plans for the playmaker’s role. “I am still waiting for Natalie now that the porters have returned home from their tour of Malawi,” he said. Ouma’s arrival brings to three the number of diaspora-based players named in the provisional squad. Already training are Mercy Wanyama (Spain) and Wanjara (USA). Still expected are Felmas Koranga (USA),  Georgia Adhiambo (Rwanda), Brenda Wasuda (USA) and Purity Auma (Bangladesh). Kenya will battle favourites Egypt, Rwanda, Burundi, debutants South Sudan and Tanzania for the sole ticket to the continental championships in Cameroon in September.
