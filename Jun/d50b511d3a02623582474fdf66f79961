The main suspect in the kidnapping of a four-year-old boy in Murang’a county has been arrested in Naivasha despite an attempt to disguise himself with a new hairstyle. Charles King’ori alias Delvin Maina was a houseboy at the home where Liam Ngucwa Mwangi was kidnapped. He was arrested in Naivasha town on Monday a few hours after the baby he had allegedly kidnapped was rescued in the town. The baby went missing on June 2 in Murang’a. He was later traced to Naivasha with King’ori. The boy has since been reunited with his parents. The distraught parents and relatives had made an online appeal that went viral. In the appeal, they asked Kenyans to volunteer any information regarding their son’s whereabouts. The parents said that the child had last been seen in Thika in the company of King’ori. Police said they are interrogating him to establish the motive behind the incident. The officers said they pounced on him as he escaped on a getaway motorbike. He is expected in court to face various charges including kidnapping. The arrest came less than a week after another child was kidnapped and killed in Kajiado county. The body of Shantel Nzembi, a Grade 2 pupil was found in Orata area, Kitengela two days after she had been kidnapped and a ransom demand made. The body was discovered on May 31 after her mysterious disappearance on May 29. At least four suspects are in custody over the incident. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
