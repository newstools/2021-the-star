Hyundai’s Thierry Neuville went to bed with an 18.8seconds cushion ahead of Toyota’s Kasuta Takamoto on the second day of the WRC Safari Rally today. The drivers traversed Oserian, Chui Lodge, and Kedong sections where World Rally teams navigated through thick volcanic ash soil. In the third position was 2019 champion Ott Tanak who wrapped up Day Two 55.8 second behind the leader. Neuville delaminated his left-rear tyre on the stage, a front puncture and dropped 39.8seconds to Ogier. “The biggest issue was the tyres in this stage. Obviously we got to the end but we have to get back to service now. There are some things to check,” Neuville said. Toyota’s Rovanpera got stuck in the final stage and the Finn was towed off the special and the stage was stopped while the Toyota Yaris was moved. He was able to continue without time penalties, as per a bulletin explaining that towing in the Safari Rally is not considered outside assistance. But the crew opted not to continue and would incur 10 minutes of penalties later on for not completing the last stage. Japanese Kasuta said: “That’s a surprise (second place). I was stopped almost four times on the stage. I have never used a wiper before for any other reason other than rain. Not for dust. Ruts are like hell. I am happy to finish this stage.”   Day 2 Results 1. Neuville (Hyundai/Bel)  1:23.19.1 3. Tanak (Hyundai/Estonia) +55.8 4. Ogier (Toyota/France) +1.49.4 5.Gus (M-Sport F.) +1.56.1 6.
