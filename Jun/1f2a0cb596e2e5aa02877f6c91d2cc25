If you're attacked or robbed, always report the crime to the police. Police are urgently appealing to the public to help them with information to put thugs in jail. Officers say many victims report attacks on social media instead of making formal reports to the police to get justice and possibly recover their property. DCI boss George Kinoti said many arrested muggers usually go scot-free and those who do report cases fail to pursue cases or never turn up for hearings. Some are afraid of reprisals. “While many victims take to social media to narrate their ordeals at the hands of mugger gangs (which is good sensitization), we urge them to formalise those complaints to facilitate prosecution once arrests are made," Kinoti said. He said police arrest suspected muggers every day but are unable to prosecute for lack of formal complaints and witnesses. The DCI said police are committed to ensuring safety but they need help from the public. Muggings have surged in the city, attributed to lack of jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Most attacks take place on weekends, late at night or early morning when fewer police are on patrol. Some of victims post the places of the attacks on social media and police are stepping up patrols in all hotspots. (Edited by V. Graham)
