Leader Thierry Neuville has kissed Safari Rally Kenya goodbye in Sunday morning’s opening Loldia stage. The Hyundai Motorsport WRT driver went into the early morning 11.33km stage with a lead of almost a minute in his Hyundai i20 over Takamoto Katsuta. But the longtime leader’s dream of winning the event was shattered after breaking his car’s rear right suspension after hitting a rock midway through the test. Neuville and co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe limped to the finish almost 45sec slower than the Japanese driver and although their lead remained intact, the damage was too great to continue and Neuville’s African adventure was over. Neuville has led the Safari over the past two days.
