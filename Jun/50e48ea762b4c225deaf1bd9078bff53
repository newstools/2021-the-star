Kenyan sportsmen and women have been urged to invest their earnings to avoid languishing in poverty once they retire. Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Western Region  representative, Tony Kweya, urged players who are still in the industry to develop saving habits that would cushion them later in life. “Most of these players get money during their career period but majority don’t invest nor save to look into what next after their career,” Kweya said. AFC Leopards chairman Dan Shikanda urged the old players not to operate in isolation but to come together and form a welfare association where they will be able to come to each other’s rescue. “Most of these retired players operate in isolation which is not healthy. It’s time we work as a team and form a union that will help us prevent this poverty,” Shikanda cited. The 45-year-old father of three and former defender was found dead at his house in Kasarani two weeks ago, three days after he could not be reached on phone. According to pathologist, Dorothy Njeru, who conducted the post-mortem at St Francis Community Hospital Mortuary in Kasarani, Nairobi, said Amanaka succumbed to heart complications. His brother, Baraza, said Amanaka was healthy and strong and he had not complained of any health problems. The late Amanaka featured for Tusker Wazee till his death. At the peak of his career, Amanaka  turned out for 11-time champions Tusker FC and Kenya Pipeline. His success at the two clubs saw him join various foreign top clubs, which include; Seychelles' Saint-Michel United, Anse Reunion FC and La Passe FC, Bosnia’s Zeljeznicar and India’s East Bengal Club. He also turned out Thika United, AFC Leopards, Sofapaka and Mahakama FC. Bonface Ambani who led other former players said Amanaka gave him  1st  professional opportunity in The Sultanate of Oman “During his stay at the club, Amanaka served us diligently and passionately, indeed the sporting fraternity has lost a true icon,” Ambani further said.
