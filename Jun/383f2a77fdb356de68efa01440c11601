Tanzanian gospel musician Christina Shusho has dodged a query on whether she is divorced. In an interview with Massawe Japanni on Friday, Shusho hesitated to confirm if she is indeed divorced and said the rumours should remain as they are. "I have heard a lot of rumours about me, there was a time it was said I was dead. There were also claims my bedroom photos had leaked, as well as people saying I am a mother of three," she said. Shusho said she does not advocate or advise anyone to consider divorce and breakups. She said women should not stay in a toxic and painful relationship and that they are free to walk out if they can't handle it. "Let the rumours about me splitting with my husband be just that. I do not want to advise people to leave each other but there are circumstances when it gets too ugly and you cannot continue. You are not supposed to live in pain. If you can tolerate pain then keep at it, but if you cannot, then let it end." During the interview, Shusho acknowledged that it is not easy living your private as a celebrity. She said at times she feels the pressure. "I am not a perfect woman and sometimes I do not do all I am supposed to do, but I try my best."
