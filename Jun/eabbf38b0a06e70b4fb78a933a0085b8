Faith Apuko has been appointed the acting clerk of the Homa Bay county assembly, a few days after Haningtone Ochieng’ resigned. Ochieng resigned on Friday last week over what he termed frustrations from the assembly service board and MCAs. In a letter to county assembly speaker Elizabeth Ayoo who chairs the county assembly service board, Ochieng said he could not continue with his work in an increasingly volatile environment. He said his efforts to create a good working relationship with the assembly stakeholders had hit a snag. “The volatile environment can’t allow me to discharge my duties effectively. My conscience is clear and under the prevailing circumstances, it’s untenable to continue performing my duties uncompromisingly,” the letter reads. On Wednesday, Ayoo said they appointed Apuko as the acting clerk. The appointment follows a meeting by the county assembly service board held on Tuesday. In a letter seen by the Star, Ayoo said Apuko will act as the assembly clerk until they get a substantive replacement. The letter was shared with all MCAs and assembly staff. “MCAs and staff are urged to accord Apuko all the necessary support in her new role as the acting clerk of the county Assembly,” Ayoo said. Homa Bay assembly majority leader George Okello said they settled on Apuko because she qualifies for the position. He said board members replaced Ochieng to avoid any gaps in their operations. “The assembly service board members did not want the operations of the assembly to stop due to the resignation of the clerk,” Okello said. The position of the clerk will soon be advertised, he said. “Apuko will have an opportunity to apply for the job and compete with others,”  Okello added.  Edited by A.N
