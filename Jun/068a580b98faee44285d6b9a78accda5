Kapseret MP, Oscar Sudi has responded to Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka after saying that his party will never work with the United Democratic Alliance. In a video he shared on Facebook, Sudi said no one has asked the Wiper party leader to team up with the Deputy President’s party, UDA. "Nilisikia siku ile ingine akisema hawezi support Raila Odinga na Raila akamuuliza kama amemwambia amsupport," Sudi said, which loosely translates to "I heard him saying he won’t support Raila Odinga and Raila asked if he had asked him for support." The Kapseret MP said it is wrong for the former Vice-president to say he is a Christian, "yet his actions say otherwise". Sudi noted that Kalonzo saying he was teaming up with ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang'ula is fine but bringing in Kanu’s Gideon Moi is hypocritical, because "he knows what Kanu did to this country". He advised that the best way for the Wiper leader can survive is by taking the pension perk recently awarded by the government and retire to Tseikuru. Sudi added that the three of them having been riding on the Raila Odinga wave and they are nothing politically without him. His words were in response to Kalonzo’s remarks in Makueni on Saturday, where he stated that Wiper will never work with UDA. According to Kalonzo, this is because Wiper is guided by the principles of good leadership and transparency in the fight against corruption. He added that he was confident the One Kenya Alliance will form the next government in 2022. "The position is Wiper Democratic Movement, ANC, Ford Kenya and Kanu we have One Kenya Alliance and that is the one that will form the government next year," Kalonzo said.
