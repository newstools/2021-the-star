Award-winnning Nigerian superstar Fireboy DML is set to thrill his Kenyan fans this July 10 at the Ngong Racecourse. "Nairobi, are you ready for the Afro-fusion festival? Happening live at the Ngong Racecourse with our headlining act Firereboy. Get your dancing shoes ready," read a statement on Instagram. Born Adedamola Adefolahan, Fireboy DML acknowledged that the love of arts grew on him as he is not from a family of artistes. While he has written poems for most of his adult life, he knew he could sing since he was 12 years old. The year 2019 was one of the best for this youngster as he released his most famous single titled 'Jealous'. His second studio album was recently considered for Grammy Awards nomination for 2021 as World Best Album.
