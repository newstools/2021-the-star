Renowned aviation company, 748 Air Services has reported an 80 per cent booking on its passenger flights ahead of the mega return of World Racing Championship Safari Rally in Kenya this Weekend. 748 Air Service Managing Director, Moses Mwangi said the high passenger traffic is not only attributed to the peak season but also the competitive air fares that 748 Air Services is offering. “We have seen an amazing increase in our flight bookings in all the routes in just one month since our launch in Kisumu, Mombasa and Diani," Mwangi said. "We are projecting that the flight bookings will continue to increase and we will be able to hit and retain more than 80 per cent." Fly 748 has been recording increased passenger bookings over the weekends. A strong indicator of the rising interest in weekend leisure travel among domestic tourists. 748 Air Services Chairman said "Our goal is to enable all Kenyans to be able to fly at very affordable market rates. This is a competitive edge that we are utilizing to sustain high bookings." Last week, President Uhuru Kenyatta said that Kenya is adequately prepared to welcome back the WRC Safari Rally slated for this weekend after 19 years. The Safari Rally is projected to inject Sh6 Billion into the country's economy. More than 1,000 police officers have been deployed to Naivasha to strengthen security during the World Rally Championship's Safari Rally. Hoteliers reported full bookings ahead of the event where around 30,000 visitors are expected in Naivasha. Over 50 rally drivers including 34 Kenyan racers are set to participate in this year’s Safari Rally. The fabled Safari Rally has always mesmerised the world. Over the years, the annual event had gained ground as a legendary fixture in the global motorsports calendar before it was dropped from the FIA World Rally Championship and relegated to the African Rally Championship in 2003.
