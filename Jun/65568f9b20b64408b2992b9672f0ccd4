Barkat Ali Manji has been trending for weeks after his mobile barbershop went viral. His is the first mobile barbershop in the country. Manji was forced to convert his van into a barbershop when Covid-19 happened. He counts among his clients Otile Brown, former Kiambu GovernorÂ  William Kabogo and Nick Mutuma. He charges Sh3000-Sh3,500 per session. Speaking about his work, Manji said: "I have clients who have booked me for a specific day and a specific time the whole year. "It's not been easy as sometimes I get very little sleep. But it's also a new market as most people do not find barbers as early as 5am. "I have also shaved some of Kenya's millionaires. Even during Covid-19, I would shave some clients up to 1am but luckily they gave me an escort back home."
