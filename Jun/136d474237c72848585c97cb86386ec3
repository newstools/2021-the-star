Tanzanian singer Baraka the prince has called out Diamond Platnumz, alleging he is a devil worshiper. Writing on Instagram, the singer accused Diamond and his mother of using ‘dark magic’ to get ahead in life. Baraka further said Diamond’s WCB company is built on devil worshipping. "Hawa @wcb_wasafi ni mawakala wa shetani Trust me Guys kuna siku mtakuja kuniambia na kama atutokuja kumkemea uyu Supers star @diamondplatnumz na mkaendelea kumbembeleza kama yai la mwisho ndani atakuja kusababisha machafuko makubwa sana katika taifa hili." In 2015, Baraka had accredited his music journey to Diamond, saying he supported his career. In 2018, Romy Jones, who was the vice president of WCB, was accused of seducing and sending love messages to Baraka's wife, Najma. Romy Jones said he knew Najma 10 years ago and has no feelings for her.
