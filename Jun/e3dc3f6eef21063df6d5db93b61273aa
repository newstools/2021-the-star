Muguka farmers in Embu have received Sh48 million to boost production of the mild narcotic. The funds from the Ministry of Agriculture were delivered by CS Peter Munya at Mavuria ward in Mbeere South on Friday. He was accompanied by CAS Agriculture Ann Nyaga and Dr Esther Kimani, the Pest Control Products Board chairperson, among other local leaders. “I have come here to give a cheque of Sh48 million to saccos, which the farmers will access via Saccos as loans to be paid on three per cent interest. This is one of the routes to fight poverty among the khat farmers in Embu. After engaging with my team we have decided each farmer to access the loan of a maximum of Sh50, 000 to make sure many farmers benefit from the money,” CS Munya said. Munya assured farmers of more grants if they spend the given money properly. The leaders vowed to support research institutions on conducting research on khat so that the plant adds more value. The funds were promised to muguka farmers in February this year at Muraru village when CAS Nyaga officially opened a Sh5.6 million muguka market. CAS Nyaga and other leaders requested the farmers to donate some of their land for research processes. “I plead with you to be adhere to the farm inputs you’ll be advised by the agriculture experts to use on Muguka farming. I also call upon the farmers to ensure good use of the finances they receive from the government,” the CAS said. She also called on farmers in the area to consider diversified farming to ensure they are secure in food production when the weather doesn’t favour muguka production. PCPB chairperson Kimani assured the board would partner with the farmers and the Agriculture ministry to monitor the products used in khat farming are not harmful to humans. According to the Embu county government, there are now 65,000 farmers growing muguka in the region, making the crop one of the highest income earners apart from coffee and tea.
