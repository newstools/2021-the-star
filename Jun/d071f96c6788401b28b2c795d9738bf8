Masalani town in Garissa has been hit by a water shortage after Kenya Power disconnected electricity over Sh600,000 bill. Subcounty water coordinator Sadam Qarad assured residents that the bill would be cleared by next week. He said the subcounty is using a diesel-driven engine to pump water from the intake to the main water supply station for purifying and pumping to the six elevated tanks within the town. Qarad said despite the effort, water is still insufficient to cater to the town residents' needs. The coordinator said the population in the town has expanded, and the water crisis will be a thing of the past once a Sh50 million World Bank-funded project being undertaken in the area is complete. Qarad appealed to consumers to pay their monthly bills on time, noting that two-thirds of the population do not pay water bills. Water chief officer Ahmed Abdirahman asked the coordinator to create a mobile phone pay bill for customers to pay bills and to always remind them through SMS of the need to pay in time to avoid disconnection. Abdirahaman promised to ensure normal water supply resumes in the area as soon as possible. Edited by A.N
