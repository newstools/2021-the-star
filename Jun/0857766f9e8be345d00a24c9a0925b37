The opportunity to win trophies and share a dressing room with the best players in the women's Premier League has informed my decision to join Blazers, says Multimedia University's Grace Bwire. The 19-year old is preparing to represent Kenya at the Junior Africa Cup in Namibia from August 14 to 22. "Blazers' trophy record is unmatched and it is one of the embellished teams in the country that guarantees winning titles. You cannot say no to Blazers because they are the best, with quality players across all the departments," said the Kakamega-born athlete. Bwire reveals that national team coach Jackline Mwangi has been keeping a close eye on her performances and sought her advice before making the decision. Bwire scored her first senior hat trick when Kenya beat neighbours Uganda 11-0 during a friendly match three months and believes she has what it takes to replace Mwangi at the club. Mwangi is Blazers' all-time top scorer. "I was keen on joining Kisumu-based Lakers but Mwangi told me Blazers would be ideal for my growth. She told me that I will take her position in the team with ease since I am 'tailor-made for the Premier League'," she said. Playing for record Kenya champions will help Bwire nail down a regular role in the national team. Blazers have in the past produced more than 70 percent of the players to the national side. Bwire forms part of Blazers' rebuilding process that also has the likes of Eleanor Chebet, Yvonne Sifuna, Agnes Mbone and Joan Anjao all under-21. The former Tartar Girls player will be offered a scholarship. Her preference, she said, is to study at Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology â€”Kakamega but is open to all options. "MMUST would be the first choice because it's near my home. Kenyatta University is another option but I will abide by the decision of the team."
