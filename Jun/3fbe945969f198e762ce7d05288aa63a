Only the education of children and youths in Laikipia North will end criminal activities in the subcounty, area Member of Parliament Sarah Lekorere said on Tuesday Lekorere said cases of cattle rustling and banditry in the area can be tamed by educating the younger generation. She challenged the government to upgrade and maintain the current public schools in these areas so that more learners can be enrolled. She spoke at Ngenia Primary School during a prize-giving ceremony for candidates who excelled in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination in Mukogodo East ward. The legislator called on parents to stop hiding in the excuse that is no employment for their children after school. “Currently job markets have gone global and many people are also finding jobs out of the country,” she noted. Lekorere said that most cases of insecurity in Laikipia and bordering counties of Isiolo Samburu and Baringo were caused by parents and guardians allowing their children to be clan morans. The lawmaker said a drought in northern Kenya has led to the movement of cattle into Laikipia and may cause insecurity among residents and immigrants who come in with their animals in search of pasture and water. Lekorere called on the security agents to look into the matter of pastoralists' influx before it escalates. She said people from Laikipia are peace-loving and would not like aggressors to come to their territory without set rules being followed.   (edited by o. owino)
