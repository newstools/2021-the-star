DCI officers have arrested a Ghanaian for allegedly conning a senior manager at a money lending firm out of Sh9 million. The Ghanaian national was arrested on Monday. According to the DCI, the manager at Tala agencies, a popular mobile money lending firm that advances instant short-term loans, met Victor Anane on an online dating site. Anane introduced himself as a preacher who performs miracles and who would help the senior manager get promoted at her workplace. He also promised to help turn her fortunes around if she fell in love with him. Wowed by the man’s overtures, the woman was swept off her feet and fell for him. “The two dated for a while and as their love blossomed, the woman was invited to the man’s residence on Transview estate in Athi River. By this time, she had given her new boyfriend Sh9 million in unclear circumstances. Some of the money she is believed to have given to him had been obtained from accounts belonging to Tala Agencies,” the DCI tweeted on Tuesday. It was during her maiden visit to the self-confessed preacher’s house that she was shocked to find paraphernalia associated with witchcraft and magical rituals. What was meant to be a romantic date turned ugly, as the woman demanded to know how the man of the cloth she had fallen in love with possessed paraphernalia associated with dark powers. Detectives raided the suspect’s house where the paraphernalia was recovered. Also recovered from his house was Sh76,000 in fake currency and other materials used in the printing of fake notes. Investigators established that the suspect, who masquerades as a preacher, approaches unsuspecting women looking for love and affection online, with promises of making their lives better before fraudulently obtaining money from them. The suspect is in police custody and is set to be charged in court with obtaining money by false pretences.
