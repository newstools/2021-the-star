Comedian Mammito says her boyfriend Eddie Butita has helped her grow in the male-dominated industry. Speaking in a recent interview with Yaza, Mammito said, "He’s always had this big dream. We make a good team." Adding, "I’m the one that gets excited and carried away by good ideas while he is the grounded one, the one who sits me down and tells me that we need a plan first." Mammito is working with other artistes, teaching them to sell their art without relying on bigger brands. "We are training them how to make sure they know how to spend their money wisely. We’ve had enough of artistes making it big and then being broke just months later because they couldn’t handle their finances," she said.
