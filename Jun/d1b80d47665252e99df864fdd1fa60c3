Mombasa politicians who defy the ban on public meetings, exposing residents to Covid-19, will be punished. County commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo has put politicians on notice for holding political meetings—superspreader events. Kitiyo said that Covid-19 is still a threat, therefore, Ministry of Health protocols and all directives by the national government must be adhered to. He warned those ignoring Covid-19 protocols, including politicians, that stern action will be taken against them, adding that there should be no room for complacency. “There are politicians who continue to hold meetings, knowing very well gatherings were banned, I urge them to cooperate so that we can fight the pandemic together,” Kitiyo said. He was speaking on Monday when launched a public awareness campaign at the Treasury Square in Mombasa. He flagged off vans that will cover the six subcounties. The one-week countrywide campaign has been organised by the Ministry of ICT, Innovation and Youth affairs through the office of the Government Spokesperson. Kitiyo, who is also the co-chair of the Mombasa County Covid-19 Response Committee, warned the number of cases is expected to increase during July. So far, 12,061 cases and 230 deaths have been recorded since last March 22, when the first case was reported in the region. Kitiyo underscored the importance of regular washing of hands with soap or use of sanitiser, wearing face masks in public, social distancing and other protocols. “It is absolutely necessary for Mombasa residents and Kenyans to follow all the protocols to protect their lives and safeguard public health," he said..
