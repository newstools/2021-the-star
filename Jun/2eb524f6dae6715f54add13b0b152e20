The funeral service for industrialist and Capital Group Limited chairman Chris Kirubi was on Friday held at the Faith Evangelistic Ministry (FEM) church in Karen. Kirubi died on Monday, June 14, 2021, at his home after a long battle with cancer. He died aged 80. Some of the leaders present at Kirubi’s requiem mass include; former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, former Vice-presidents Kalonzo Musyoka and Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetangula. Deputy President William Ruto’s wife Rachel Ruto and former Presidential candidate Peter Kenneth were also present. In the memorial service, Raila disclosed that late Kirubi was one of the people who convinced him into a political deal with retired President Mwai Kibaki following the disputed 2007 presidential election. The ODM leader said it was after the meeting with Kirubi that a meeting was organised between Kibaki and himself at Sagana which ended one of the worst bloodshed in the country's history. "Among the two people who approached me to have dialogue was Chris Kirubi...the other one I cannot reveal," Raila said. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka also revealed that it was Kirubi who negotiated for his vice president slot in 2008. "He came to my house in 2008 with Peter Munga and the reason was simple, you have to act in a manner that will save our country." "That is how I became the 10th vice President of this country," Kalonzo said. Chris Kirubi's burial is set for Saturday at his farm in Thika. The burial ceremony will begin at 11am.
