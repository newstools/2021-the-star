President Uhuru Kenyatta has arrived in Paris, France for a two-day official visit. The president who left Kenya on Tuesday evening is expected to seal the deal for the construction of the Sh160 billion toll highway from Nairobi to Mau Summit which is expected to begin in September. This will among others address traffic congestion on the northern corridor. The 233-kilometre contract that was awarded to a French consortium made up of Vinci Highways SAS, Meridian Infrastructure Africa Fund, and Vinci Concessions SAS last year will see the road expanded into a four-lane dual carriageway through a Public-Private Partnership model. The consortium is expected to design, finance, construct, operate and maintain the express. The firm will then recoup its finances using the revenues and income generated by the electronic toll collection system along road over a period of 30 years. The project will also involve widening of the existing Rironi- Mai Mahiuâ€“Naivasha road to becoming a seven-metre carriageway with two-metre shoulders on both sides, construction of a four-kilometre elevated highway through Nakuru town, and building and improvement of interchanges along the highway. Last month, transport cost along the Northern Corridor jumped 48 per cent in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly on measures to contain the virus by regional states. A report by the Shippers Council of Eastern Africa (SCEA) indicates road freight rates increased in the key trading route which runs from the Port of Mombasa, across the country, into Uganda, Rwanda, DR Congo, Burindi and South Sudan.
