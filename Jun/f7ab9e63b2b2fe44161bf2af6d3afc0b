Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company has said it will shut down water supply pipeline along Waiyaki Way Road on Wednesday. In a notice on Tuesday, the Nairobi Water said the shutdown will take place from Kabete Water Treatment works due construction of the Nairobi Expressway. The shut down will be from 6 am Wednesday to 6am Thursday. Areas to be affected include estates along Waiyaki Way, Rhapta Road, Parklands Road and Church Road Westlands, Highridge and Parklands areas. Nairobi School, MP Shah Hospital Muguga Green Estate, Sarit Centre and the surrounding estates will also be affected. "... the shutdown will facilitate interconnection of relocated pipeline to the old pipeline at the junction of Waiyaki way Road and James Gichuru Road," the notice read. “This will enable release of the road section between Nairobi School and the junction of Waiyaki Way Road and James Gichuru Road to the Expressway road contractor.” Nairobi Water has appealed to affected customers to use available water sparingly as they work towards restoring the supply. President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the 27km project on October 16, 2019, as part of the plan to decongest the Central Business District. The project, implemented by Kenha, is a four-lane dual carriageway that connects the Nairobi-Mombasa section and the Nairobi-Nakuru highway section terminating at Waiyaki Way. In September last year, Kenya Power announced it was relocating power lines along the highway and will bill Kenha Sh1.08 billion. It is expected to be completed in December 2022 by the China Road and Bridge Corporation. The expressway will have 10 interchanges, including the SGR terminus at JKIA, Eastern Bypass, Southern Bypass and Enterprise Road. Others are at Capital Centre, Haile Selassie Avenue, Thika Road, The Mall in Westlands, Sarit Centre and James Gichuru Road.
