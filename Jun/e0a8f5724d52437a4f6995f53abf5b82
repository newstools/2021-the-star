Kenya Morans’ will face off against Ivory Coast in their Fiba Afro-Basket 2021 Group ‘C’ opener on August 25. They meet top seed and favourites Nigeria two days later before winding up their group stage fixtures against Mali on August 29. Morans’ assistant coach Sadat Gaya yesterday said the team will probably assemble next month to start strict training for the two-week festival. “We will start off our training after the women’s team finished off their Afro-Basket zonal qualifiers,” he said. The 16-nation tournament will tip off on August 24 at the Kigali Arena in the Rwanda with group phase games running from August 24 to 29. Each group winner will advance automatically to the quarter-finals with the eight teams that finish second and third in four groups competing for the remaining last spots. Morans’ Australian coach Liz Mills is expected to return to Nairobi next month to start preparing the team. In a related development, Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) has added Storms coach Abel Nson to the team’s technical bench. Together with Gaya, the duo will assist coach Mills to shape up the team’s return to the continental tournament after three decades.
