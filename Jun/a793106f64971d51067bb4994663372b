Construction works in Wang’uru Stadium, Mwea, have reached top gear as the government upgrades it to host 58th national Mashujaa Day celebrations. All eyes will be on the stadium come October 20 when guests from across the country are expected to converge in Kirinyaga for the event. On Friday, a national government delegation, led by Principal Secretaries Karanja Kibicho (Interior), Paul Maringa (Infrastructure), Charles Hinga (Housing) and Jerome Ochieng (ICT), inspected construction works. They were joined by Governor Anne Waiguru and county officers. Waiguru later told Ngurubani town residents the stadium will be completed in August ahead of the first national event to be held in the county. “We were inspecting its progress in preparation for the upcoming Mashujaa Day. We expect to host President Uhuru Kenyatta and other international and national dignitaries during the fete. Start getting ready to welcome them,” she urged the crowd. If all goes according to plan, the Central region will have so far hosted two national celebration events. In 2017, the 54th Madaraka Day was held in Kabiruini Grounds, Nyeri county. Waiguru said with the completion of the stadium, Ngurubani town and the entire county will rise economically and lives will be improved. “We want Wang'uru to be among the best stadiums in the country,” she said, amid cheers. Two weeks ago, county commissioner Jim Njoka led the County Projects Implementation Committee in supervising its progress. He said it was 82 per cent. “The contractor has assured us that the work will be complete by August 18, 2021,” Njoka said. Construction works of the Sh300 million facility commenced in August 2020 after President Uhuru Kenyatta found it in a pathetic state during his February tour of the county. He then promised that the stadium would be upgraded. Besides national events, the stadium will be hosting sports activities that will likely boost the sporting talent in the county.
