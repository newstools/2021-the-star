Women from Kiambu have expressed displeasure at their representative Gathoni Wamochomba's decision to join Deputy William Ruto's faction of Jubilee. When she joined Tangatanga on Wednesday, Wamuchomba said she had made the decision because it was the wish of her constituents. "I am aligning myself with the DP because that is where my people wanted me to be," she said. On Friday, women from the 12 subcounties of Kiambu waved placards in demonstrations, saying they were not consulted. They said no one had asked Wamuchomba to ditch President Uhuru Kenyatta's side for the camp that is currently popularising the United Democratic Alliance party. "Gathoni made a personal decision which has angered those who voted her on the Jubilee ticket," said Eunice Wanjiru, a Kabete subcounty resident. Juja resident and women's leader Dorcas Wanjiru said they were disheartened by Wamuchomba's decision which came months after a Jubilee loss in a by-election in the constituency. People Empowerment Party's George Koimburi beat Jubilee's Susan Njeri after he garnered 12,159 votes against her 5,746 votes in the election held last month. Wamuchomba was among the top campaigners for Njeri and Wanjiru blamed her for loss by the Jubilee candidate in the poll. "By her defecting, we know what her actions were now," Wanjiru said. Thika resident Jane wairimu said Wamuchomba was no longer serving the interests of the people she represents. Wairimu said Wamuchomba should be removed from the leadership of the Kenya Women Parliamentary Association. The women affirmed their support for President Kenyatta in delivering for all Kenyans until his term ends. They said Wamuchomba's job was their leader was done.  (edited by o. owino)
