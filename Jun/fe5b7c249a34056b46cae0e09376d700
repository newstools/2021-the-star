Ugandan legendary singer Jose Chameleone says he plans to retire from the music industry at the age of 50. The 42-year-old told a Uganda radio station that he will slow down when he hits 50. "I’m 42 years old, I only have eight years to 50. At 50 I will be tired so I will have to slow down. I don’t want to jump on stage for my entire life." The 'Valuvalu' hitmaker says he is not into music beef as he has seen it all in his career. "You can’t find me in musical fights anymore simply because I am contented, I’ve almost seen everything. I am content, I’ve almost seen everything." Chameleone recently ran for mayor in Kampala but lost. The Leone Island records CEO started his career in the early 90s while working with one of Kenya's top labels at the time, Ogopa DJs. He was a DJ in Kampala. The 'Kipepeo' hitmaker released his first album in 2000.
