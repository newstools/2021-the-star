The government and the private sector have embarked on a digital programme aimed at arming more than 50,000 Micro Small Enterprises (MSEs) with skills to grow their businesses. Dubbed, 'Future Ni Digital', it is expected to have started impacting the small businesses by end of this year, starting with Nairobi before being rolled out in  other parts of the country. Partners include the Ministry of Industrialisation, Trade and Enterprise Development, Micro and Small Enterprise Authority (MSEA), Stanbic Kenya Foundation, Microsoft Kenya and the African Centr e for Women, Information and Communications Technology (ACWICT). Speaking at the Kariobangi Center of Excellence during the start of the training, Industrialisation Chief Administrative Secretary, Lawrence Karanja, said the government is keen on  promoting digital technologies and ICT, to create employment opportunities and improve public service delivery. The programme expects to place 2,000 youth into employment by the end of 2021. MSEA chief executive Henry Rithaa said:“Our mission is to create an environment that makes our MSE sector globally competitive. Continuous skill improvement is key for survival in today’s dynamic market environment." As part of this, 192 trainers have  undergone the requisite training in a bid to kick off the mass training of the entrepreneurs. Stanbic Kenya Foundation and Microsoft Kenya have also deployed an online learning platform to enable learners to access content and further develop their skills. Stanbic Bank Kenya CEO Charles Mudiwa noted:“Many enterprises in the country are still struggling to recover from the effects of the global pandemic, and we have seen that having digital skills is key to survival."
