The construction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project is taking shape and the government will buy electric buses soon, Housing PS Charles Hinga has said. The PS posted in his Twitter account on Monday, "We are making good progress, fabrication of stations is ongoing, park n ride facilities, bus depots, command Centre all under construction.” He said that the inception phase goes to KNH, and there are five corridors designated for Mass Rapid Transport. Hinga added that the stations have taken care of everyone, and there is a ramp to get to the top of the footbridge and a special lift to take wheelchairs down or up the station. “…in other words, there is universal access.” In November 2019, the government floated the BRT tender, saying it intends to improve the infrastructure of Thika Superhighway to accommodate the project. A Chinese firm, Stecol Corporation, secured the Sh5.6 billion contract to construct special lanes for high-capacity buses in July 2020. The project is being carried out in two phases. Phase I is from Clayworks to the Nairobi CBD, Phase II will run from Clayworks to Ruiru. At Kasarani, the construction of the maintenance block for 10 BRT buses at a time is to be completed in eight months. Platforms for picking and dropping passengers are also at an advanced stage of construction. Earlier this month, the government allocated Sh700 million to the construction of the project. Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (Namata) CEO Francis Gitau on Wednesday said the project is on course and resources will fast-track the project. Funds are expected to be available in the next financial year but the release date was not immediately known.
