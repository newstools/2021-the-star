Harmonize's ex-girlfriend Fridah Kajala has spoken out about viral nude photos of her and her daughter Paula that have been making the rounds on social media. The Bongo movie actress released a statement on Monday night, saying the nude pictures were edited. Her face and that of her daughter, Paula, were placed on the bodies of unknown naked women. She said the pictures and videos have caused her so much pain, with people questioning her parenting abilities. She described the act portrayed in the photo as a curse. Kajala and Harmonize dated for less than three months. "I have never and will never take such a picture with a daughter I carried for nine months and gave birth in so much pain. I might be having many weaknesses, but don't forget I am a mother." She defended herself, arguing that she has a big tattoo on her back but the person in the viral photo has no tattoo on her back. "My pain for Paula is similar to yours for your child. Even if I am ratchet like you say, I can not get to the point of taking nude photos with my daughter, I am God-fearing." The photos leaked just months after Kajala and her daughter Paula were accused of leaking Harmonize's nudes and private chats. The two were arrested and after grilling by Tanzanian authorities, they were released on cash bail. Harmonize then said his lawyer is preparing a cyber-crime case against people who took part in sharing his alleged nude video and photos online. Kajala's daaughter Paula has been rumoured to be dating Wasafi signee Rayvanny after photos of them together were shared online.
