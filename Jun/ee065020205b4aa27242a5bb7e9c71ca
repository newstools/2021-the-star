Efforts by a 10-member team to end a leadership impasse at the Kisii county assembly ended in disarray Wednesday after the two factions failed to agree. Both sides clung to hard-line positions, with some MCAs asking speaker David Kombo not to set foot in the chambers. There have been efforts to remove Kombo from office. Kombo has since gone to court, where he got an injunction to have the impeachment proceedings against him stayed until the case is heard and determined. Birongo MCA Benard Ogari, who was among the committee members chosen to lead the talks, said the impasse still stands. “We want to report to you that there has been no way found out of the impasse and as the matter stands, both protagonists in this conflict, speaker Kombo and clerk James Nyaoga have court orders,” Ogari said. He said they are mulling calling on Governor James Ongwae to intervene if the stalemate persists. “The atmosphere has not been conducive for the speaker to conduct the assembly’s business. In the event of failure, we will invite Governor Ongwae to reconcile the speaker and the MCAs,” Ogari said. He said by Wednesday afternoon, there were also plans by deputy speaker Davins Onus to file another case concerning the mace. “With all these developments, nothing much can be done in committee stages or kamkunjis,” Ogari said. He was flanked by pro-Kombo MCAs during a press conference at the Kisii Sports Club. There are fears the House could stand dissolved if members miss eight consecutive sittings in a row. By Thursday, anti-Kombo MCAs said there shall be no business in the assembly until Kombo leaves office. “We don’t care whether we will miss sittings or not but Kombo who is making claims to the post of the speaker, should not come to the chambers to preside over any sitting,” Sensi MCA Paul Angwenyi said.
