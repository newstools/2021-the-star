Delivery platform,Glovo, plans to make Kenya its regional hub for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa as a customer service center According to the firm’s CEO and co-founder Oscar Pierre this is as part of Glovo’s strategic expansion in Africa and Eastern Europe in the next two years. “We plan to start serving and controlling the operations in these countries from Nairobi, where we are going to have a customer service centre,” said Pierre He added that this decision was reached as Nairobi has a good culture of customer service, therefore is a good place to start in terms of ease of doing business. The firm in the beginning of June launched its first micro fulfillment center in Nairobi as the company expands its ‘Q-commerce’ division (that’s “Q” for quick). Q-Commerce means that consumers can use Glovo to order from their favourite supermarkets and neighbourhood stores, and from today they can now additionally order from Glovo Market. Glovo Market uses the latest in in-store digital technology and dedicated resources to ensure the quickest possible delivery times with customers receiving their orders in 20-40 minutes. “Covid-19 impacted traditional brick-and-mortar retail. We believe that micro fulfillment centers represent an important part of the future of post-pandemic retail,” said Pierre. Glovo’s micro-fulfilment centre will help expand the retail ecosystem, bringing several advantages. For example, by using Glovo’s micro-fulfilment centre, individuals and small businesses can open retail businesses, selling products on the Glovo’s platform which are fulfilled through Glovo warehousing and logistics (last mile) services. By opening up MFC’s Glovo is also creating job opportunities and giving distributors and retailers additional sales channels.
