@ppcheti Sailors and fishermen in Lamu have been warned against venturing into dangerous channels in the Indian Ocean as heavy rains can compromise visibility. County director for meteorological services Edward Ngure said heavy rains pounding the region are often accompanied by strong winds especially on the open seas, making navigation dangerous. Speaking on Monday, Ngure asked all sea users to acquaint themselves with weather updates from his office so they can know when it is safe to venture out. He listed channels like Mlango wa Tanu in Mkokoni, Mlango wa Ali in Kiwayu and Mlango wa Bomani in Kiunga as the most dangerous and asked sailors to avoid them during the rainy season. All the three channels are in Lamu East. Other dangerous channels are Manda Bruno, the Mkanda and Shella channels and Mlango wa Kipungani in Lamu West. They have been labelled ‘killer channels’ because of their location in the deepest parts of the ocean. They are also characterised by rough tides and deadly waves. Hundreds have lost their lives in those channels. “The heavy rains have made these channels deadlier than before in terms of navigation and so we are asking them to be very cautious but if possible stay away from those channels,” Ngure said. Lamu county disaster management and rescue team leader Luqman Abdulaziz said they had recorded fewer marine incidents this year and accredited the situation to the fact that boat operators were observing maritime regulations. He warned of reduced visibility at sea owing to the heavy rains and urged boat operators to ensure their vessels are fitted with navigation lights to avoid collisions. “We are also asking them to ensure passengers wear their life jackets properly," Abdulaziz said. Much of Lamu’s transport is by water with over 5,000 boats in the region.  Edited by P.O
