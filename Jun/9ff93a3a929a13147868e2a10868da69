“I know my way home; once I am done with what I’m doing, I will take a boda boda to your house.” These are the last words the family of Thomas Nyanaro Mose heard from him on May 25 in Mombasa. And ever since, the 47-year-old man has been missing, leaving his family in anguish. On May 23, Mose called his sister Mary Kwamboka and complained of a fever and headache, but said he had taken some medication and was hopeful he would get better. Kwamboka told the Star she directed her brother to move to their elder sister’s house in Magongo where he would be taken care of. Even though adamant, Kwamboka said her brother went to Magongo the following day, where he spent the better part of the Sunday. “However, at night while everyone was asleep, he caused a  commotion after he woke up claiming that there were witches who were after him and wanted to kill him as a sacrifice. After that, he could not sleep until the following day,” Kwamboka said. On May 25, Mose’s brother-in-law took him to Coast General Hospital, where the doctor recommended he undergoes a full blood test. It was while waiting for the results that Mose disappeared. “My brother-in-law had gone to the lab to pick the results. But when he came back, he was not there. Attempts to search him within the hospital were futile," she said. Kwamboka said she attempted to call Mose and he told her that he was tired of waiting at the hospital to be treated. The sister said the father of six told her he was in a bar in Bombolulu. Kwamboka’s attempts to track him by phone were futile as he kept changing locations. She said in the last conversation she had with her elder brother, she asked him to pick a boda boda and head to her home in Bamburi. “But he told me that he was a grown man and he had errands to do and he would only go home once done. He sounded disoriented. He was not of sound mind," she said. From then, Mose’s phone went off and he has never been seen again.
