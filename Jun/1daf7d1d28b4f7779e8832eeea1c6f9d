 ODM leader Raila Odinga has dismissed claims of having powers to influence party nominations saying he would have favoured his brother Oburu Oginga and cousin Jakoyo Midiwo. Raila has on many occasions been accused of influencing party primaries in favour of loyalists and friends. But Raila on Saturday said he does not have such powers. If he had, he would have favoured Oburu and Jakoyo. Both lost the ODM party primaries in 2017. Raila who spoke at the burial of Jakoyo in Gem, Siaya county, said he respects party structures. Jakoyo served as Gem MP for three consecutive terms before he was defeated by Elisha Odhiambo in 2017. Mourners had claimed he was rigged out. Raila said the party respects its structures and that if he had powers to rig anyone, then he would have favoured Jakoyo and Oburu. “But because through the nomination process they lost and then they appealed and they also lost the appeal there is no way I could have imposed them as ODM candidates,” Raila said. Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo who trounced Jakoyo was present. Odhiambo had vied for the seat in both 2007 and 2013 but lost to Jakoyo before unseating him in 2017. Ida Odinga who also attended the funeral condemned aspirants who incite youths against their opponents. “I know Luo youths have a habit of attending funerals to heckle their leaders under the influence of handouts from few aspirants, a habit that cannot help anyone,” Ida said. She said leaders should be respected whether they are delivering or not. Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga also condemned rowdy youths who heckled leaders during Jakoyo's burial. Rasanga said youths sought to use their energy in income-generating activities instead of looking for cheap handouts to heckle MPs.  Edited by P.O
