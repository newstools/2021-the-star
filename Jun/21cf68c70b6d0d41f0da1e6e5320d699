The local star had already eked out a healthy lead after Friday’s gruelling leg, but kept the pace up to claim two stage wins over a slightly less punishing penultimate day. A 10sec penalty for a late time control check-in was the Kenyan’s only stumbling block, but he was so far ahead of his rivals that it didn’t even matter. The Volkswagen Polo GTI R5 pilot held a 5min 32.7sec lead in the category at close of play and also placed eighth in the overall standings. Former Junior WRC challenger Karan Patel was second in a Ford Fiesta R5. He inherited the position when Polish pilot Daniel Chwist retired with a broken track control arm in Soysambu 1. Former Safari winner Carl Tundo also benefited from Chwist’s demise and moved up to third in his Polo. Recovering from a dramatic opening day, he claimed four stage wins and trailed Patel by 1min 54.2sec. Aakif Virani completed the leaderboard 37min 42.8sec adrift of the leaders. The Skoda Fabia R5 driver was given 3min 20sec in time penalties after multiple early and late check-ins.
