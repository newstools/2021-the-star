Singer Bahati says he felt uncomfortable while on the gospel side because most artistes in the ministry are hypocrites. In a recent TV interview, the 'Mama' hitmaker said most secular musicians have a real connection with God, unlike many who are in gospel. He added that he has a better relationship with God and his religion than most people in the gospel music industry. “Call me an entertainer. Don’t call me a gospel artiste because that term has been misused. But I am so real with God. I am spiritual,” he said. “I am deeply connected with God than most gospel artistes. When I was in the gospel industry, I had scandals because they were created. People fought me in the gospel industry. Nowadays, I don’t have scandals.” Bahati is currently promoting his new album, 'Love Like This.'
