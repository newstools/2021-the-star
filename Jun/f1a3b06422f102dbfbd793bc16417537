Actress Sanaipei tande who plays the role of Nana Tandala in drama series Kina has opened up about accepting her character on the show that airs on Showmax and Maisha Magic Plus. This comes a few weeks after she was subject to a Twitter conversation over her murder trial that has been ongoing on the show. According to Sanaipei, there are those who do not know the difference between her the singer and the actress, while others would just say things to get to her. "I’ve learnt not to react because reacting fuels conversation and more comments, be it insults or compliments," Sanaipei said. She goes on to say that Nana Tandala’s murder trial on the show has tested the limits of her strength, despite being known to be fearless and resourceful; she has to go home after the trial and think of how to get herself out of the situation. "For the first time, you see that Nana is frustrated by the way things are going, and by the testimonies that are being given," she said. Sanaipei added that looking at Nana’s situation as her real self, she deserves justice from the trial. When the show Kina premiered, Sanaipei admitted that Nana was the most challenging role she had ever played, but she has learnt to grow into her character, to anticipate her actions and to accept her for who she is. "Now I kind of already know what she is going to do even without having to take instructions from the director," Sanaipei said.
