President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to the family, relatives and friends of Mama Dorcas Pedelai Ntimama who passed on last night at a Nairobi hospital. Mama Dorcas was the wife of the late Cabinet Minister William Ole Ntimama. In his message of comfort and encouragement, President Kenyatta described the late Mama Dorcas Ntimama as a gracious woman who worked tirelessly for the wellbeing of society. The President said Mama Dorcas always built strong bonds of friendship, which ensured harmony and peace in her community. "It is heartbreaking that we've lost Mama Dorcas. As a nation, we are grateful for her many years of service to Kenya especially in Narok where, with her late husband the Hon Ole Ntimama, they offered leadership and service to the community for many years. "For those of us that interacted with Mama Dorcas, we shall miss her maternal demeanour and welcoming smile that made everyone around her comfortable,” President Kenyatta said. The President prayed to God to grant the family fortitude and grace to bear the loss of their matriarch. “Losing a parent is never easy, may you find solace in the lovely memories you shared with your dear mother and may she rest in eternal peace,” the President condoled with the Ntimama family. Deputy President William Ruto said Mama Ntimama, was a firm, God-fearing and responsible woman who brought up upright and diligent children. "We pay tribute to the great life that she led and the memorable mark that she leaves behind. We will miss her warm company," Ruto said. "We pray that God grants the Ntimama family and their loved ones strength and comfort to bear the loss. Rest In Peace, Mama Dorcas." ODM leader Raila Odinga said he learnt with pain the passing of Mama Ntimama. "She was the bedrock of her husband’s politics, matriarch to the Maa. Dorcas championed Maa culture and promoted the education of girls. I experienced your generosity, friendship and kindness. RIP Mama," he said.
