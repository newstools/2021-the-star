Looking at the timelines given by the Court of Appeal, it is very likely that a judgment will be given in July. This, in the absence of an appeal to the Supreme Court, will set the stage for a referendum and ultimate amendment of the Constitution. However, no matter how soon the judgment is delivered, an appeal to the Supreme Court by a losing party is inevitable. The appeal will push the timelines beyond August 2021. Yesterday, a three-judge bench of the Court of Appeal headed by the court’s president Musinga JJA gave directions on the hearing of the Consolidated BBI Appeal (four appeals having being filed namely, Appeals no. 291/2021, 292/2021, 293/2021 and 294/2021). By consent of the parties, all the applications filed under rule 5 (2)(b) were withdrawn paving the way for the expeditious hearing of the BBI appeal. The court’s directions provided inter-alia that the appeal shall be heard between June 29, 2021, and July 2, 2021, by a seven-judge bench to be constituted in due course. The court also allowed the IEBC to continue discharging its mandate without touching on the contentious issue of the delimitation of the electoral units. There are three fundamental reasons why the appeal has been given priority and shall be heard on consecutive days. One, the BBI is an important topic for the general public. Two, some of the clauses in the BBI Bill, including the issue of delimitation of the electoral units, must be done at least one year before the next general election (the second Tuesday of August 2021). Lastly, every part of the divide is looking at the court to see how fast it will deliver ‘justice’ that suits them. Advocate of the High Court of Kenya. mola@mknlaw.co.ke
