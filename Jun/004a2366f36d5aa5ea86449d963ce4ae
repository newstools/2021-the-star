The High Court in Nairobi has ordered NHIF to pay Meridian Medical Centre Sh12 million for terminating a contract without clearing arrears. The exact amount was Sh12,469,330, outstanding for the six months of the pilot project. At the Milimani  Commercial and Tax Division Court, judge Maureen Odero on June 4 also ordered NHIF to pay the facility Sh118,117,688, the amount outstanding for the second quarter of 2012. Prosecution witness Dr Peter Ngunjiri Wambugu, chairman of the Meridian Medical Centre, testified that on July 21, 2008, NHIF sought  expressions of interest for outpatient  services for its members, It would be under the Capitation Method by which the NHIF would pay to the provider a premium per annum. Dr Wambugu said  they tendered for a pilot to provide outpatient care and on September 29, 2008, they received an NHIF letter confirming they had been pre-qualified. They entered into a six-month contract  from January 2010 to June 2010, they said. Under the agreement, the facility was to be paid Sh2,000 for each beneficiary. For an estimated 38,000 beneficiaries, the amount payable to Meridian was to be Sh77,678,000, representing a monthly instalment of Sh12,946,333. Wabungu said NHIF only paid for five months and then declined to pay the final instalment. He said that in 2011 NHIF advertised in local media calling upon public servants to select their preferred medical facility. He said that 32,839 members selected Meridian Medical Centre. They again entered into a contract three years from January 1, 2012, which was under a capitation payment method. On March, 13, 2012, NHIF paid Sh116,935,500 to cover the first quarter of the contract, leaving a balance of Sh881,954,813. He further testified that on June, 14 2012, NHIF issued the facility a termination letter without giving a reason or a three-month notice. Among other orders sought by the hospital was for the Fund to pay Sh531,772,594, being the loss of profit for the remainder of the contract   expenditure of Sh34,218,038 incurred in the performance of contract. NHIF denied the existence of a valid  and enforceable contract between the parties. They argued NHIF and the board  of management are separate and distinct. They said the board of management lacked the authority to bind the NHIF by executing the two contracts. They said the plaintiff ought to have sued the  Board of Management and not the Fund. "In my view,  this argument is nothing but a red herring and the defendants are merely trying to rely on a difference without a distinction," the judge said Defence witness  Johnstone Ouma who was the ag head of supply chain with NHIF stated only four Meridian clinics were accredited to provide outpatient medical schemes for civil servants and not 12, as claimed by the plaintiff. The defence also said the High Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute, given that Clause 15 of the Pilot Project Agreement and Clause 19 of the Primary Healthcare Agreement both contained arbitration clauses. In her judgment Odero said the defence ought to have raised the issue before filing their defence. “By failing to do so the defendants are now stopped from relying on the arbitration clauses in the contracts,” she said.
