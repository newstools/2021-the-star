At least two million Huduma Namba cards are yet to be collected by Kenyans despite the national government having processed between 5.3 to 5.5 million cards. Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna on Wednesday said about three million Kenyan have collected their cards. “The roll out of Huduma namba cards has continued across all the 47 counties uninterrupted. So far, a total of 5.3 million cards have been produced, out of which three million have been distributed," he said. Oguna had earlier noted that most Kenyans delayed in choosing the location where the card should be sent, despite getting messages on their mobile phones. "The options are actually in a link. You click the link and you will be given options. So you choose an area that is convenient to you," he said. At the same time , Phase two of the exercise will begin at a later date to be announced by the Government. Kenyans who missed the first exercise have been encouraged to participate in the next phase. Kenyans have also been warned against fraudulent SMS texts being sent, duping them to pay to get the cards. “The rumour that one should pay Sh100 for collecting Huduma namba cards is fake. The card is absolutely free,” Oguna added. To fast track the status of the cards, the government will introduce a portal to replace the  use of the 080011122 number.
