Ndhiwa MP Martin Owino has asked the government not to hike taxes for small businesses to boost them. The MP said the government should instead focus more on taxing people operating bigger businesses and ensure they do not evade remitting revenues. On Thursday, Treasury CS Ukur Yatani read the 2021-22 Financial Year’s budget to Kenyans at the National Assembly. Yatani unveiled the Sh3.6 trillion budget which is higher than the current financial year’s at Sh2.8 trillion. "What Kenyans are concerned about is whether the government will increase tax on basic goods like milk and bread," Owino said. Speaking to journalists, the MP asked the government not to increase tax on essential products, saying most Kenyans were living under tough economic times. “Many Kenyans are struggling to buy basic commodities. Kenyans will be disadvantaged should the government increase tax on such goods,” Owino said. The legislator asked the government to look for ways of mobilising resources to meet the Sh3.6 trillion budget. He said there was a need for Kenyans not to get overburdened because many of them depend on basic goods from SMEs for their livelihoods. Kenya's taxation system covers income tax, value-added tax, customs and excise duty. “Let the government hunt for individuals with big business organisations who evade paying taxes. I know the country will meet the budget if such loopholes are sealed,” Owino said. The lawmaker said the government should intensify the fight against corruption to avoid misuse of public resources. He said corrupt businesses are not taxed. The MP also asked the government to match tax payment with development so that all Kenyans can benefit from paying taxes. “Money paid to the government should trickle down to Kenyans. Every Kenyan expects development in their areas,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
