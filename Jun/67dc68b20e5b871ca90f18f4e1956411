Cynthia Cheruto leads Team Kenya to the Africa Junior Championship slated for Egypt later this month. Cheruto will fly Kenya's flag alongside Faith Urasa and Rinahaz Kassam in the girls' Under- 16 category, with Melissa Mwaka, Mercy Oresha and Debbie Polo featuring in the girls U-14 category. Team Kenya finished fourth in the U-16 category last championship held in Algiers while placing sixth in the U-14 category. Coach Francis Rogoi said the team has trained well and will be looking to improve their positions in both positions.  “We have a good squad and we are hoping to move up the log and being competitive," added Rogoi. The two age sides qualified from the Tanzania show two years ago and Rogoi said with a week to go before their departure, they are fine-tuning their preparations. "We have a couple of days before departure and we are hoping to improve all our facets of play,” he added. Rogoi said he hopes to arrive three days before the tournament kicks off to acclimatise to the weather conditions which are expected to be hot and humid. “I hope we arrive in good time and adapt to the weather,” added Rogoi. Team Kenya will face the likes of host Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, Uganda, Gabon and Tanzania among others. Rogoi expects competition to come from the Arab nations. “The Arab teams will have the advantage of playing at home and they have the experience but we are not here just to make up the numbers we want to compete and be the best.” Rogoi said the girls have had experience of playing in some local and regional tournaments to aid their preparation. "The two teams have played some tournaments and will not be rusty,” added Rogoi.
