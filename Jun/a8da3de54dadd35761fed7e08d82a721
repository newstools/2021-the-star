As much as Ulinzi Starlets have respect for their opponents Vihiga Queens and Thika Queens, who are primed for playoffs,Â  you can only underrate the soldiers at your own peril, coach Joseph Mwanza has said. Newbies Ulinzi and Nakuru West Queens have defied odds to qualify for the knockouts starting on May 19. The elimination matches will determine the team that will win the Women's Premier League this season. Cyrus Kanyi led Thika to the title in 2016 while Vihiga, under the guidance of Alex Alumira, won the subsequent three titles. Both teams are having a good season and are considered as favourites owing to their experience but Mwanza believes thorough preparations will be key. "Thika and Vihiga have proven to be very good and, obviously, are on another level. They are unbeaten in the league and are worthy of our respect but remember this is a one-off match. Any team in the playoffs cannot be underrated. Ulinzi have fought all along to reach this stage and whoever tries to write us off should do so at his own risk," said Mwanza. "Preparations involve movement, logistics and the morale of the squad while the technical and tactical aspects of the game will also be looked into. Players need motivation. How desperate or badly the players want it will be a determinant too." Mwanza observed that past experiences, where overwhelming favourites have been sent crushing by underdogs, are a reason for optimism in the team's quest for the WPL title. "We saw Thika Queens eliminated in the FKF Women's Cup by little-known Mukuru Talent Academy and that shows you nothing is impossible," said Mwanzia. In the meantime, Mwanza has called on FKF to reveal the venue for playoffs by the end of the week to enable the coaches have a clear view of where their teams will play. "The federation has assured us they will cater for everything in the playoffs, which is good, but we are yet to know where these matches will be played. It will be good if they let us know this week," said Mwanzia.
