The government has called for public-private partnerships to create jobs. Industrialisation PS Kirimi Kaberia told investors that the economy of a country is grown by partnerships and good laws. He said the government is investing in local and international traders to improve the standards of products manufactured and packaged locally for export. Speaking during the groundbreaking ceremony of the Sh1 billion Africa Logistics Properties Warehouse in Rironi, Limuru, Kaberia said the laws that the government has put in place are friendly to investors. “We are working on reducing the cost of power, water is available as well as better roads to improve movement,” he said. The PS was accompanied by ALP chief executive officer Richard Hough, Tilisi CEO Renee Namji, among others. The 312,000 square feet facility, will provide a centralised location for local, regional and international business owners. It is located off the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, which is currently being upgraded to a six-lane road. Kaberia said ALP has challenged the government to come up with such a facility, saying it will help to revolutionise warehousing in the country. “The opportunity was there, but it was not exploited. We are happy since we have been challenged by ALP,” he said. Hough said the facility is designed to help incubate small and medium enterprises and introduce them to warehousing standards and model of operation. “When we are exporting products, we do not export substandards. The SMEs around will be trained on how to produce standard products,” he said. Hough said warehouses will be hired by investors, while others will be left to ALP to store and package products. “We are extremely excited to be contributing to the growth of manufacturing, cold storage, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, logistics and various other sectors in Kenya by providing modern warehousing for businesses that are the backbone of the country’s economy,” the CEO said.
