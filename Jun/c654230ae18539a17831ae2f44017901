Actress Miss Morgan says she is raising her daughter Imani as a single mum after futile legal efforts to get the father involved. Speaking in a radio interview, the mother of one said her daughter is her biggest inspiration. "I am a single mother na sina bwana physical. Itakuwa aje nikiwa so selfish niache huyu mtoto peke yake? That is not the kind of family set-up I was brought up in," she said. She said the baby daddy said he was not going to take care of a child who is not living in his house. "Achana na baby daddy. Sitamwongelea vibaya but he is not there and he is not in the picture," she said. "I avoid talking ill about him since his blood runs in the blood of my daughter." Asked if the baby daddy is a public person, Miss Morgan said, "No, but he comes from a royal family. I tried to follow the law but it got to a point where I gave up and said I was not going to force him to be in his daughter's life. I went to court and he asked for DNA. Can you imagine? Ikakuja 99.9 per cent of him. It's okay but acha imkule. "I have a brother, a dad and so a man figure doesn't have to be a dad. Those are enough people who can stand with my daughter and I can struggle with my daughter. Ntamfikisha mahali atafika. She is the biggest inspiration after my mum." A while ago when she was depressed, and it was her daughter who made her decide to work on herself and even quit alcohol. "She is the most amazing daughter in the whole world. She is Imani and she is my inspiration. I know I cannot afford to shame this girl coz it's not fair. I have an amazing family and my mum is very supportive. This has always picked me up," she said.
