Kenyan athletes should brand themselves accordingly on their social media platforms in order to attract corporate sponsorship and handsome merchandise deals. The remarks were made by Kenya Breweries Limited head of marketing, Beers Ann Joy Michira during a stakeholder engagement workshop held to enlighten the athletes on sports branding and marketing at a Nairobi hotel on Thursday. Michira said Kenyan athletes had the potential to mint extra income by capitalising on the huge following they enjoyed on their social media platforms. She reiterated KBL’s long-term commitment to continue supporting sports in the country through appropriate sponsorship. “KBL is excited to host these forums to educate our athletes on personal branding and creating an inclusive and diverse. Through such initiatives, we want to make sure our athletes have the required knowledge and platforms to excel through their sports and as a brand” said Michira. She noted that such sponsorship would enable more women to get into sports. “The greatest impact of our athletes has always been that they always bring us together as Kenyans and put us on the global map. By giving these young ladies the platform and tools to excel in their various disciplines,  we enable them to tell their story as they inspire the next generation of female athletes” Deputy general team manager (women), Winnie Kamau, thanked KBL for coming forward to mentor the Kenyan female athletes, noting that the session will go a long way in ensuring the team can leverage their sporting platforms to improve their lives. “We are grateful to KBL for their continued support for Team Kenya. The mentorship session will enable our athletes to package themselves to monetise their brand. “This forum with our sportswomen goes a step further in actualising their commitment to walk with these athletes and give them the right platform to excel,” said Mrs. Kamau.
