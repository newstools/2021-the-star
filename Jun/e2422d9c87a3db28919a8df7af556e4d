Eldas MP Aden Keynan has said that those insisting that the Jubilee Party is dead will be surprised with what is to come. Speaking on Citizen TV, Tuesday, the MP said the people assuming President Uhuru Kenyatta will not have a say in the next general election will also be surprised. Keynan singled out the ODM and Wiper parties which have been working closely with Jubilee in ensuring service delivery to Kenyans. "Raila Odinga is not the head of government and is the head of a very strong party; Kalonzo is not in parliament but is the head of a very important party. To that end, those assuming that because the President’s term is coming to an end Jubilee will end will be sorry," he said. Keynan who is the Joint Secretary for the Jubilee Parliamentary group said every election period provides different circumstances for alliances to be formed since the inception of multiparty democracy. He added that this is what Jubilee is doing given the current circumstances. "We as Jubilee are desirous of escalating the same cooperation we have had under the handshake in parliament and outside with ODM into a coalition." "The same cooperation we have had with Wiper and other like-minded parties. We are willing as jubilee and ready," Keynan added. This comes amid calls by Deputy President William Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance allied leaders calling Jubilee, Wiper and ODM tribal-based parties. UDA is made up of among others; leaders elected on Jubilee tickets who are allies of Deputy President William Ruto. The DP, over the weekend during a visit to West Pokot, confirmed that UDA is the party he will use to vie for the presidency in 2022. His announcement came days after Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju announced plans to have an alliance between ODM and Jubilee that will see the two parties field one presidential candidate in 2022.
