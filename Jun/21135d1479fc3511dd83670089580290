Wales caretaker manager Robert Page named uncapped midfielder Rubin Colwill in his final 26-man squad for next month’s European Championship but there was no place for forward Hal Robson-Kanu. Colwill played six games for Cardiff City this season after making his senior debut in February. “He really impressed me. He’s got presence, he’s got something we have not got in the middle of the park as well,” Page said of the 19-year-old. Robson-Kanu was a key player for Wales at Euro 2016 where he scored a stunning goal against Belgium in the quarter-finals. He was left out of Page’s squad after being excluded from their training camp in Portugal last week. Forward Gareth Bale will lead the team, who are in Group A and begin their campaign against Switzerland on June 12 in Baku. Squad: Goalkeepers: Wayne Hennessey (Palace), Danny Ward (Leicester), Adam Davies (Stoke City); Defenders: Chris Gunter (Charlton), Ben Davies (Spurs), Connor Roberts (Swansea City), Ethan Ampadu (Chelsea), Chris Mepham (Bournemouth), Joe Rodon (Spurs), James Lawrence (St Pauli), Neco Williams (Liverpool), Rhys Norrington-Davies (Sheffield United), Ben Cabango (Swansea City); Midfielders: Aaron Ramsey (Juventus), Joe Allen (Stoke City), Jonny Williams (Cardiff City), Harry Wilson (Liverpool), Daniel James (United), David Brooks (Bournemouth), Joe Morrell (Luton Town), Matt Smith (Man City), Dylan Levitt (Man United), Rubin Colwill (Cardiff City); Forwards: Gareth Bale (Real), Kieffer Moore (Cardiff), Tyler Roberts (Leeds).
