A Nairobi court has issued a warrant of arrest against a businesswoman linked to a Sh700 million land fraud case for failing to appear for plea taking. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi issued a summons for businessman John Mugo Njeru to appear in court on June 28 for plea taking in relation to eight counts of forgery and fraud. The magistrate also ordered the arrest of businesswoman Mary Wanjiru, who has gone underground since 2016. When the case came up for plea taking on Wednesday, the court was told that Wanjiru has not been traced, prompting the magistrate to issue a warrant of arrest against her. He also issued a summons for Njeru after he failed to appear in court as he was required. He was said to be unwell. The prosecution alleges that Njeru and Wanjiru, jointly with others not before court, with intent to defraud Jambo Holdings Limited a land parcel valued at Sh700 million forged a title in the name of Mary Wanjiru and John Mugo Njeru purporting it to be a genuine title registered at Athi House, Nairobi. The magistrate ordered that the case be mentioned on June 28 at City Court No.1 for plea taking. In another court, the managing director of Mashir Nakuru Automotive Limited was charged with several counts of fraud in relation to tax evasion amounting to over Sh100 million. Zameer Kassamall Mohamed, who appeared before Milimani principal magistrate David Ndungi, pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of fraud in relation to tax and failure to pay tax by due date. The first count states that between January 1 and December 31, 2015, at Mashir Building, Nakuru county, the accused, being managing director of Mashir Nakuru Automotive Ltd, omitted from his return an amount that should have been included, thereby occasioning outstanding Value Added Tax of Sh23,115,367 payable to the Commission Domestic Taxes as required under the Act. The prosecution further alleges that between January 1 and December 31, 2018, at the same building, he knowingly omitted from his return an amount, which should have been included, thereby occasioning outstanding income tax of Sh14,159,853 payable to the Commission Domestic Tax. Other amounts include Sh7,895,397, Sh7,551,053, Sh3,925,035, and Sh42,629,328. The magistrate ordered that the accused person be released on a bond of Sh20 million or bail of Sh10 million.
