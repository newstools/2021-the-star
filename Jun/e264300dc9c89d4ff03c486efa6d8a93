Athletics Kenya will work closely with the contractor laying tartan track at Gusii Stadium to ensure  it conforms to international standards. Technical officials from AK led by John Kimeto and George Kariuki inspected the ongoing works on Saturday and are impressed with the progress so far. “We came here courtesy of Sports Fund to check on the progress of the stadium. Sports Fund is keen to support the ongoing works so that this stadium meets international standards,” said Kimeto who is also AK executive committee member. He added: “Basically, we have done today is to ensure  the track measurements are up to standard and conforms to international standards. We want Gusii Stadium to be among venues that can host national and international events.” Kimeto said they will give a comprehensive report to Sports Fund and Kisii Governor James Ongwae this week. However, he said  establishment of a warm-up track and athletics changing rooms will be among the recommendations. Kariuki said he is impressed  with the  progress so far, adding that a tartan track cannot be installed until the football pitch is redone. “The stadium is taking shape and so far 20 per cent of the works have been done. Once the football pitch is redone, the contractor will start laying the tartan,” said the veteran technical official. The football pitch is being redone by the Ministry of Sports through the Sports Fund on orders of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Speaking during Mashujaa Day last year, President Uhuru asked the ministry to redo the pitch and improve drainage. The county government is doing the tartan track. The President also ordered the stadium renamed after former Cabinet Minister Simeon Nyachae.
