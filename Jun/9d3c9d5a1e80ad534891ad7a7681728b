The Office of the Registrar of Political Parties has closed the checking of parties' membership status through e-Citizen, after protests from Kenyans. In a statement on Wednesday, the ORPP said that this was only a pilot period that ended on June 21, 2021, and the "feedback received was appreciated". "This service has therefore been deactivated to allow @ORPPKenya factor invaluable feedback receipted. Requests received on this matter are being processed," the statement said. The announcement comes a few days after Kenyans took to social media to protest following revelations that they had been registered as members of political parties without their knowledge. Kenyans confirmed their membership status through an online portal on e-Citizen, shared out by the office of Registrar of Political Parties. The office of the Registrar of Political Parties later defended itself saying that recruitment of members is only done by parties. "Recruitment of members is done by political parties in line with respective party constitutions; section 7, Political Parties Act, 2011, second schedule to Political Parties Act paragraph six," the office said last Saturday. Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu last week announced that her office was piloting the online service to enable the public to verify their political party membership status. She added that the office was also planning to enhance other services including the management of independent candidates, party membership recruitment and registration. "This is, therefore, to appraise you on this development and invite your feedback through info@orpp.or.keÂ or to our offices," Nderitu said.
