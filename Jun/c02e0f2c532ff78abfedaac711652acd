The Treasury should hasten the release of county funds to help tackle biting drought, pastoralists have said. The cash will help counties to buy livestock feeds, truck water and vaccinate livestock. If not done soon, the pastoralist will lose livestock for lack of pasture and water. Kenya Livestock Marketing Council chair Dubat Amey said the frequent delays in disbursement of county funds harm pastoralists. Speaking to the press in his office on Thursday, Amey said the county does not have money and cannot help pastoralists overcome the shocks of drought. “Let us be realistic, counties cannot operate without funds. Right now we are talking about drought and the state has a big role to play to avert it,” Amey said. Amey urged the national government to put in place measures to cushion pastoralists from losses, including starting the off-take programme. The National Drought and Management Authority has issued an alert over the deterioration of livestock and milk production. The  situation worsened when the region received below-average rainfall during the March-April period. On Monday, governors threatened to shut down counties next week, citing lack of funds to run operations. Through the Council of Governors, the county chiefs criticised the delayed disbursement of monies by the National Treasury. The lack of money has crippled operations and delivery of critical services to the residents. CoG chairman Martin Wambora said Treasury has yet to release Sh102.6 billion to the 47 devolved units, with only two weeks left to the end of the financial year. They have given an ultimatum to the Treasury to release the cash by Friday or they shut down the counties. On Wednesday, the Treasury said it will release Sh39 billion to the county governments by Friday. Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani told Senators on Tuesday that his ministry will disburse the funds to clear April and part of March arrears.  (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
