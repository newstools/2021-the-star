Alego Usonga MP, Samuel Atandi has called for the resignation of Deputy President William Ruto. Speaking on Citizen TV, Thursday, the ODM MP said that Ruto has refused to leave the government even after he was told he has no role. "The DP has refused to leave government... he should do what Jaramogi Oginga Odinga did when he decided to leave government," Atandi said. He said the DP should do that so can speak from outside government. Atandi stated that Ruto and his Tangatanga-allied MPs are part of government and they should have started implementing the bottom-up approach instead of waiting for after 2022. The MP said there was no need for Tangatanga to claim to lecture the government on what it should do because they were locked out of the command centre of corruption. "They are forgetting they have this thing called bottom-up approach that they are claiming will take effect after 2022. They should actually be infusing those ideas in government," Atandi added. Atandi has joined the list of ODM MPs who have been calling for the resignation of the Deputy President, in what some have termed as disrespect for President Uhuru Kenyatta. Homa Bay County woman representative, Gladys Wanga is one of those who have publicly called for the DP's resignation saying that he should not pretend to have any respect for the Head of State. Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe has also asked Deputy President William Ruto to resign. "If he feels he has members of the cabinet who are a threat to his personality, then he cannot sit with them. If they can't take a walk, then he should take a walk," Murathe said.
