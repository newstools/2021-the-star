Police in Migori county are looking for the neighbour of a man found murdered on Friday morning. The man, thought to be aged between 45 and 50, was a farmhand and lived in Migori town. His neighbour was also a farmhand. The two lived in a compound that only had two houses, both made of mabati. Traders headed to the market at 4am said barking dogs drew their attention. On investigating, they saw blood on maize plants in the compound and then found the farmhand's body. “The body was found with a mattress and utensils from his house left behind,” said Caleb Ombura, Suna Central chief. “The neighbour had disappeared and the compound showed there had been a struggle before the death. We have launched investigations to question the neighbour and get more information on what transpired.” The body was taken to Migori Referral Hospital mortuary. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
