Homa Bay residents have urged Governor Cyprian Awiti to complete projects his administration started during his first term. Residents of Ponge in Kabondo Kasipul constituency want the county to expedite the construction of Ponge-Ramula bridge. Construction of the bridge started in 2014 but stalled a few months later. The bridge connects the residents to Ramula Subcounty Hospital. On Monday, locals led by Vincent Sule and Susan Kayoko said they cannot access Ramula due to the absence of the bridge. “Many expectant mothers from Ponge cannot access health services at Ramula hospital during the rainy season. Governor Awiti should intervene,” Kayoko said. Residents said they have lodged complaints with Homa Bay government officers but nothing has been done. “The problem has been here for about seven years. Governor Awiti should complete the projects he has started before he retires next year,” Sule said. Last week, residents of Kanyach Kachar threatened to take back the land they donated to the county government in 2015 to drill a borehole. The land is about a quarter of an acre. They said the Homa Bay government has not implemented the project despite perennial water shortages in the area. Through chairman Juma Odero, the community said they will no longer allow their land to remain idle for an unspecified period of time. “It’s high time we took back our land after the long awaited project stalled. Homa Bay government shouldn’t blame us,” Odero said. The water project was intended to help more than 300 households. Residents have been trekking about 4km in search of clean water for domestic use. Homa Bay Water and Environment executive Dickson Nyawinda said the Kanyach Kachar water project is among 28 projects they have earmarked for completion. The project was to cost the county government Sh8.1 million. “It's important for residents to remain patient and calm because plans to complete the project are underway,” Nyawinda said. Edited by A.N
