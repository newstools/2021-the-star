Jumia customers will enjoy free pickup tomorrow from 9 am across all Jumia pick-up stations countrywide as the company celebrates its 9th anniversary  under the theme 'kila kitu kila siku ’. “The Jumia Anniversary Sale is on! We want to offer our customers amazing value 24/7 all year around,” CEO Sam Chappatte said. “As an extra sweetener, Friday 18th June we will offer our consumers free pick-up countrywide. This is a great chance to send food packages or gifts to friends and family upcountry”. The deal will be valid for all pre-paid orders above Sh500 on the E-commerce platform. “We are rapidly expanding our pick-up station network across the country. Pick up stations are convenient, lower cost and allow customers to engage one-on-one with our agents - to ask questions and for help placing orders. We believe this will be a key lever to growing the penetration of e-commerce countrywide,” he said. Over the last 12 months, Jumia has doubled its pick-up station network to over 800 across the country in Central, Western, Nyanza, Coast, Eastern, North Eastern regions.
