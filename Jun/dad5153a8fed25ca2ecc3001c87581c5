Kedong stage near Moi South Road is expected to be the toughest stage today as WRC Safari Rally enters Day 2 today. The stage is synonymous with volcanic ash soil where the teams will have to be clever to navigate. Crews will today tackle two loops of three stages. Chui Lodge (SS2/5), which covers 13.34km, has never been used before and heads into the bush and out over the plains before continuing along a twisted and heavily wooded track. Kedong (SS3/6) was used in 2002 when the Safari Rally was last included in the WRC. After a fast start, the track heads across an area of black cotton sand (fesh-fesh). The 32.68km special is the longest and potentially most challenging of the rally and terminates in a rough and rocky section. The Oserian (SS4/7) stage of 18.87km is another new special and crosses the plain adjacent to Chui Lodge. Meanwhile, local stars are expected to thrill WRC3 competition for Safari Rally's return to the FIA World Rally Championship. Karan Patel in a Ford Fiesta, Onkar Rai in a Volkswagen Polo GTI R5, and  Carl Tundo in a similar machine will be the men to watch today. Tundo claimed victory by over 12 minutes at the Equator Rally in April, which included some identical stages to those that feature on this week’s itinerary. He also shares a Safari Rally record with Shekhar Mehta, having won the event five times— albeit not as part of the WRC. Tejveer Rai also starts in another Polo. Previous WRC experience will come in handy for Patel after he contested the Junior WRC in 2016.
