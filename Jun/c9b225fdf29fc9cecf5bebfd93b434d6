A post widely shared on Social media platforms Facebook and Whatsapp claiming that the government will shut down sim cards due to a fault in Huduma number registration is FALSE. The post further claims that the government's intent is to defraud Kenyans by use of fake phone calls and later wipe clean their mobile money accounts. It reads “due to failure in your Huduma Number registration details, we will close your line. Contact Huduma Centre for correction,” The post is designed to look like a warning against a scam. "Don't even call them, don't try to give any information when you receive that message. They might con our parents," the scam post reads. However, on Friday, the Interior and ICT ministries cautioned Kenyans from falling prey to the scam. "It has come to our attention that citizens are receiving the attached message. If you do get it, do not act on it and immediately report the sender number to your ISP." "Be warned that it is fake...It is not a message from Government. Be alert... Do not be conned," the Ministry of ICT under CS Joe Mucheru warned in a statement. "Kindly disregard the message. Please note that the official contact number for Huduma Kenya is 0206900020," Huduma Kenya added. The Ministry of Interior under CS Fred Interior further clarified that the identification numbers are free of charge and explained how one can receive information from Huduma Kenya. "All SMS notifications from the government are sent from HUDUMANAMBA and not via a landline nor a mobile phone number," the statement by Matiang'i reads. Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna speaking in Nairobi on Wednesday said three million Huduma Namba cards have so far been collected out of 5.5 million that are ready. Oguna also revealed that phase 2 of registration will commence soon.
