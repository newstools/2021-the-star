Parents of Koisomoi St Joseph Primary School in Bomet East have held protests following the transfer of headteacher Leonard Korir. They are dissatisfied with the manner in which the transfer was done and want it rescinded. “If the Education ministry will not listen to our request, then we will close this school until the matter is resolved,” board of management chairman Raymond Kosgey said. Kosgey was addressing journalists at the school on Wednesday. He said he visited education offices, but the officials never gave him a chance to air his grievances. “It is unfortunate that the education officials refused to listen to me. I called upon Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha to make changes in this office and bring in new officials who will understand the challenges people undergo in schools," he said. Praising the headteacher, Kosgey said he had greatly improved the school’s performance. The school had not been doing well before his tenure, the chairman said. “Since he took over the leadership of the school, the pupils are performing better and the mean score has improved over the years. The school was not performing well in the past, but we began to see a transformation when he took over,” he said. Joseph Mutai, a parent, appealed to education officials to cancel the transfer, saying they will relentlessly bar a new headteacher from taking charge. Emily Ngeno, another parent, expressed concern that the transfer will interfere with the school progress. She added that if the decision will not be reversed by the end of this week, they will paralyse learning and mobilise their children to join demos against the transfer.
