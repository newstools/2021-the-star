There was more violence  on  Monday in Marani, Kisii, following  the killing of a boda boda operator at Rioma police cell, in Kitutu Chache North. Angry villagers and youth stepped up their protests and demanded justice for the affected kin. Eric Ochanda, was bundled into cells on Thursday but the family found the body at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital morgue. He is said to have been arrested for lack of a mask during the the swoop. Family members said they suspect he was clobbered and that he may have died in the cell before his body was transported to the mortuary. On Sunday, a student was also shot dead in the chest during confrontations. Two other people are also said to be nursing bullet injuries as police faced off with rioters. On Monday, political leaders from the region said they want answers over the killings. Sensi Ward Rep Paul Angwenyi asked the Independent Policing Oversight Authority, IPOA, to probe the two killings. "People here want nothing less than justice for families... As leaders we urge IPOA to take up the matter and quickly and bring to book all the officers involved," said Angwenyi. Police officers at Rioma said the suspect fell ill while in the cell and was rushed to hospital but died. This is the second incident involving officers at Rioma Police Station. In January, a hawker was arrested for lack of a mask but died in the cells.
