There are no plans merge The Service Party with Deputy President William Ruto-linked United Democratic Alliance, Mwangi Kiunjuri said on Wednesday. Kiunjuri instead said his party will enter into coalitions with "like minded parties". "Our determination is to continue building a formidable party and it is bearing fruit. Our membership and leadership is increasingly clear about its place and position in both Mt Kenya and in the country at large," the former Agriculture Cabinet Secretary said during a press conference at the party headquarters in Nairobi. Last week, UDA secretary general Veronica Maina announced there were plans to merge the two parties. Kiunjuri said he is soon rolling out a massive membership drive in readiness for the August 2022 General Election. Kiunjuri launched TSP last year, promising that it will be the alternative "vehicle for the people of Mt Kenya". Kiunjuri has previously been touted as one of the leaders who may deputise Ruto come 2022. The Deputy President is understood to be eyeing Mt Kenya as a preferred region to produce his running mate.
