The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is planning to acquire multiple servers that will be used to transmit results to the tallying centre during next year's polls. IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati on Tuesday said the commission will also seek a collaboration with the media to transmit results. "We will have multiple servers if possible one for the media, one for the political parties, one for the candidates and one for the public. The issue of having one server will not be there in 2022," IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati said. Chebukati further said the commission will bring on board the Communications Authority. "The authority will identify areas that do not have a 3G network so that we can communicate in advance and look for alternatives for transmitting results," he added. He made the remarks during the launch of IEBC's 2020-2024 Strategic Plan, Boundaries Review Strategic Plan and the Election Operation Plan at the Bomas of Kenya. Present at the event were Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju, NCIC chair Samuel Kobia, Chief Registrar of Judiciary Ann Amadi and Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu. Chebukati said the commission has now turned its focus towards the 2022 General Elections, the boundaries review and electoral activities that may arise in the intervening period. IEBC on Monday launched the Annual Voter Education Week (AVEW) at the Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi. The documents contain a road map of electoral activities as well as key timelines and milestones to be achieved. The UK has since pledged to provide financial support to the IEBC as it seeks to deliver on its mandate.
