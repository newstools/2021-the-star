President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to the family of Mzee David Kamau Waweru (Wakamau), 79. Waweru who was also known as Wakamau is the father to the President of the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Richard Ngatia. In his message, the Head of State described Mzee Waweru as a respected elder whose wise counsel and leadership will be missed by the Kangemi ward community.

The President wished the family of the departed elder God's grace and fortitude as they mourn their beloved matriarch. Mzee Wakamau was an accountant and a laboratory technologist. He joined the public service in the 1960's starting in the tax department of the defunct East African Community.
