In a statement, Muli assured Kenyans that he panel will discharge its mandate with utmost fidelity to the Constitution, warning that any candidate who will attempt to influence the process will be disqualified. “Any attempt by a candidate to canvas or otherwise influence the selection process will automatically disqualify the candidate from the process,” she warned.
