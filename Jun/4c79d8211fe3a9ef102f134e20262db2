The Ministry of Health on Monday launched a blood donation drive set to be carried out for one week at Uhuru Park, Nairobi. In attendance during the launch of the drive was Health PS Susan Mochache,  accompanied by Kenya National Blood Transfusion Services head Dr. Nduku Kilonzo. Monday marks 'World Blood Donor Day', which takes place on June 14 each year. The aim is to raise global awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products for transfusion and of the critical contribution voluntary, unpaid donors make to national health systems. For 2021, the World Blood Donor Day slogan will be “Give blood and keep the world beating", the World Health Organization has said. WHO added that the message highlights the essential contribution blood donors make to keeping the world pulsating by saving lives and improving others’ health. It reinforces the global call for more people all over the world to donate blood regularly and contribute to better health. "A special focus of this year’s campaign will be the role of young people in ensuring a safe blood supply," WHO said. Adding that in many countries, young people have been at the forefront of activities and initiatives aimed at achieving safe blood supplies through voluntary, non-remunerated blood donations. "Young people form a large sector of the population in many societies and are generally full of idealism, enthusiasm and creativity," WHO added. The Ministry of Health urged the public to join the movement and help save someone's life by donating blood. “You are giving someone a chance to live a life just by donating your blood. Wishing a very Happy World Blood Donor Day to everyone," MoH said.
