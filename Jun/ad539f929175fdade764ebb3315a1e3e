Kenya Power has announced interruption of power supply in Kisumu City on Thursday to enable ongoing works on the 220 kV Olkaria-Lessos- Kisumu line. The power outage which will start from 7am will affect parts of Kisumu Central Business District, residential areas and adjacent areas. According to the power company, electricity will be restored at 4pm. Currently, Western Kenya is mainly served through the 132kV double circuit Lessos-Lanet transmission line. The new 220kV Olkaria-Lessos-Kibos transmission line that is under construction is expected to stabilize power supply to the Western Kenya region and address existing supply challenges. It is part of the transmission projects that the government is currently undertaking to strengthen the electricity supply infrastructure across the country. Weeks ago, Energy CS Charles Keter and Kenya Power MD Bernard Ngugi were summoned to appear before senators over perennial power outages countrywide. During the session, lawmakers expressed outrage about the inconvenience and business hardships caused by the frequent outages. There were calls to break up the monopoly and rid it of embedded cartels. .
