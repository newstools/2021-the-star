High Court in Nakuru has summoned the Registrar of Births and Deaths to authenticate birth certificates of deceased businessman Washington Olweny’s four children. Judge Teresia Matheka also ordered the birth register produced in court following claims birth papers of the children of one of the three widows, Norah Atieno, were forged. Details in the birth certificates were key in the succession case to help prove Atieno was married to Olweny. The wealthy Rift Valley surveyor owned properties in Nakuru including Evans Sunrise Hospital. “Information in the original births and deaths register will not prejudice the succession case because they are in public domain and Atieno will be given a chance to cross-examine the registrar,” Matheka said. During a previous hearing in which one of the multi-millionaire businessman's sons, Allan Onyango, wanted to lock out two of his step mothers from inheriting his father’s wealth, Atieno was accused of forging birth certificates to include Olweny’s name in her children’s papers. Olweny was married to Phelisia Akoth, Anne Wanjiru and Atieno, but Onyango claims that his father was married to Akoth in a monogamous Christian marriage in 1966. The court heard that the original birth certificate of Atieno’s children didn’t bear the name of Olweny. There were claims made that the certificates had discrepancies in names, dates in contrast with the originals, raising questions as to the authenticity of the evidence. In her defence, Atieno told court some information of her fourth born child were entered by her co-wife Akoth and Olweny. Atieno said Akoth who also wants to lock her out of the deceased properties could have provided wrong  information on her child. During the latest hearing on June 2, Matheka gave the Registrar 30 days to file the register, extracts and any other information entered in the register in relation to the birth of Atieno’s four children. -Edited by SKanyara
