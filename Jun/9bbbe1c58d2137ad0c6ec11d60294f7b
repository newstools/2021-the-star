Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has said that the 2022 General Election would have been a smooth sailing ride for Deputy President William Ruto if only he were humble. Speaking on Wednesday, Mutua said deputies are only supposed to play supporting roles behind the scenes. "The problem with Uhuru’s deputy is that he was not humble. Deputies are supposed to be in the background supporting, not competing with their bosses," the governor said on Inooro TV. Mutua said that former President Daniel Arap Moi became president because he was humble during the leadership of Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. "That’s how you do a transition if you’re working together. If someone is a dictator it’s something else," he said. Adding that, "If you’re greedy now you will always be greedy and we don’t want someone who’s greedy holding our pot." Mutua called on Kenyans to be wary because it will be a tragedy to elect leaders they are not sure of. He went on to say that it is up to Kenyans to decide if they want to move forward or remain where they are. The Machakos governor said the failures of the Jubilee government should not be blamed on the handshake because it came recently. Mutua said the government belongs to Uhuru and Ruto and one’s failure is attached to the other. "They have been together for seven years; what did they do that the he (DP) says he will do better yet he has been in charge?" "That means that whatever formula they were using, both of them have failed. That’s why I tell Kenyans they should not be cheated," Mutua said.
