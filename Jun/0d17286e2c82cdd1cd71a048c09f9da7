Content creator Joan Murugi, alias Yummy Mummy, says couple therapy saved her marriage. Speaking in a recent TV interview, the mother of three recommended therapy for other couples as a way to resolve issues. "We both have very different approaches to conflict. I am an extremely confrontational person but he will just not say anything," she said. "It has taken therapy and a lot of communicating for us to get to a point where I told him, when you withdraw from me and I withhold communication, it hurts me. And he was like, well, if you come shouting, I feel disrespected. So it's a work in progress. "We are getting better and before, we would go for two weeks without talking to each other. Our therapist told us not to let the sun set before resolving our issues. Couple therapy has saved my marriage." She said family members are one-sided. "A pastor is okay but you will never reveal all details to them. Therapy is an open space where you can objectively have your issues sorted out." A while ago, social media users noticed she was no longer wearing her wedding ring. She had also stopped posting her husband on her various platforms, making fans believe all was not well at the Munyis household. The content creator said she has made her decision to permanently keep her husband Zack Munyi off social media. She said it was a mutual agreement. "I deleted every photo of him on my page and people thought we had broken up. It was just a decision we made." On why she stooped using her brand name 'Yummy Mummy', she said she missed some advertising jobs because of her association with motherhood content. "Yummy Mummy grew up bigger than I expected and at some point, I wanted to change to my actual names since I felt it was boxing me in and out and a lot of people and brands used to see me as a mum. My content is wider than that."
