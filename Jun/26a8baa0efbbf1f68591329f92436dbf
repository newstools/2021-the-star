Tanzanian RnB star Loui has dropped his most anticipated EP called Lights on me. The singer, who is currently in Kenya, has released the first single to the EP Hennessy. Speaking to Word Is, Loui said each song from the EP addresses a specific issue. "About the song Hennessy, I did it especially for the ladies, I was fantasising. It is a club banger, a party song." The EP has six songs. He documents his music journey in each of the songs. "Lost is a song about a personal experience. It talks about a man who goes back to his girl and apologises, something I have seen with my friend." He is signed under the US-based record label Legacy Records. "They saw my talent and their aim is to get our African music by African people international. For me, it was a huge blessing. I worked for this day and night, they listened to my music and decided to sign me." Loui adds that he sings for the ladies. "They are like flowers, beautiful to admire. The role of a woman in society is huge." He promises to make his Kenyan fans proud. "Positive energy and good vibes, I know what my fans want. I know Kenyans speak a lot of English and I have all the variety, both Swahili and English. For me, I have something different."
