Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja's mother was a government officer at the prison services, hence they lived in a government house. During an interview with Churchill Show, Sakaja said when his mum, Emily Kubasu died, they were forced to vacate the government property. Sakaja is the lastborn in a family of three. He said his mum died when he was very young. "My mum used to work in government, she died in 1994. I was nine years, but we continued staying in government quarters. But in 1997, we had to move," he said. Sakaja recalls the wonderful lady his mother was, saying she was a champion. "Oh, my mum. My mum was a champion. She died very young, she was 41. At that time, she was one of the seniormost ladies in the prison service at Langata Women's." "She was Kenya's fastest runner. In 1971, she was the East African champion for the 200m race. "She represented Kenya in many short-distance races. She was very ambitious, and maybe that is why she died at a very young age. "Very loving, I am told. I didn't know her much by the time she died, nilikuwa mtoi bado, and I remember it very clearly, like yesterday."
