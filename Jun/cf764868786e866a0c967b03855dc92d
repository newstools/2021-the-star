Seventy five Kenyan troops arrived back into the country on Saturday from a successful peace keeping mission in Darfur, South Sudan. The troops came in on Saturday, some minutes to 3pm aboard an Ethiopian Airlines flight. They comprised of 65 male and 10 female soldiers and have been in South Sudan for 21 months. The troops were received at JKIA by Deputy Army Commander Major General Albert Kendagor on behalf of the Army Commander. "We thank God you went and came back safely even though we lost our colleague Sgt Mwangi who became sick," Kendagor said. "You have been on the mission the longest, did your work with dedication, maintained response and build the name of our country," he said. The major general noted that there was supposed to be a rotation early this year but it could not happen since the mission was almost coming to an end. The troops will be in isolation for 10 days before being allowed to mix with their families. "We are pleased with the work they have done, they have projected the good image to the world," he said Their work was to investigate crime, undertake protocol duties, VIP escort duties and other assignments given by the UN.
