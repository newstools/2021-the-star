Kilifi County Referral Hospital is appealing for blood donations to replenish its reserves. Hospital medical superintendent Eddie Nzomo said on Thursday that they have organised a blood donation drive this Friday. The drive will take place outside Matron Chivatsi building within the hospital. “We are targeting to collect about 200 units of blood. We are also looking at the possibility of having blood donation drives every month. We want to make sure we have sufficient blood at any given time,” he said. Nzomo said a pint of blood can save up to four people. He said the facility depended mostly on donors from churches and schools, but since Covid-19 struck, it has been hard to conduct blood donation drives. “The hospital has a monthly average need of 100 units of blood. We currently have about 60 units of blood. This puts us in an awkward situation bearing in mind that we are a referral hospital,” he said. Nzomo said the bulk of the hospital’s blood reserve goes to women and children. “We conduct several caesarian section procedures which cannot be conducted without having standby blood. This county has many cases of anaemia and malaria. These cases need blood without forgetting accident cases,” he said. The hospital also has a sickle cell clinic, which has a high demand for blood. Kilifi has three major highways where accidents occur almost daily. Kilifi hospital receives patients from Lamu, Tana River and Kwale counties. In some cases, the hospital has been forced to source for blood from Mombasa and Nairobi. Edited by A.N
