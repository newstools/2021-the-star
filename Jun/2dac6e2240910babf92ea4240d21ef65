Former Icaciri Girls Secondary School Principal, Jane Muthoni has been sentenced to a 30-year jail term. Muthoni and her accomplice, Isaac Ng'ang'a, alias Gikuyu were found guilty of killing Kiiru Boys High School Principal, Solomon Mwangi. Justice Joel Ngugi on Thursday described Muthoni as a vengeful wife who planned and financed her husband's murder. Both of them will serve a 30-year sentence but this will be backdated to 2016 when they were arrested. The State had last month called for the death sentence for Muthoni who orchestrated the murder of her husband who was the Kiiru School Principal. State Counsel Catherine Mwaniki and Mbuthiâ€™s family lawyer, Mathenge Wokabi had urged Justice Joel Ngugi to consider employing the maximum sentence for the matter considering the circumstances of the murder. The two observed that the two offenders showed no remorse or regret throughout the trial that has lasted five years. Mwaniki told the court that the offenders planned the murder for months and executed it with precision and cruelty. Mwangi had been reported missing on November 6, 2016. His mutilated body was found eight days later, dumped at Karakuta Coffee Estate in Juja sub-county, Kiambu County. Muthoni had been accused of orchestrating her husband's murder between November 6 and November 11, 2016. The prosecution had stated that Muthoni killed Mwangi because she suspected he was unfaithful, accusations which she vehemently denied.
