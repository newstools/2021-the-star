Brazil vs Ecuador 05/06/2021 3:30 pm Brazil with a perfect record and a +10 goal difference comes as no surprise here. Three of those four victories saw Brazil win one half by an exact two-goal margin. The Brazilian defense has been exceptional in this competition, at home mostly, where they have won seven straight World Cup qualifying games ‘to nil'. September 2016 remains the last time Brazil conceded a World Cup qualifying goal at home, with their last dropped World Cup qualifiers home points coming a further six months before then. Ecuador look a very determined side after missing out on two of the last three World Cup editions. Ecuador followed up an opening matchday loss to Argentina with three straight World Cup qualifying victories. Two of those wins came versus higher-ranked opposition, with both seeing Ecuador score inside 15 minutes. However, they have lost seven straight World Cup qualifiers away games vs teams that were ranked higher at the time of the draw for this World Cup qualifying campaign. Four ended 2-1, despite Ecuador equalising after falling behind inside 25 minutes in three of those matches. They have also lost all five of their previous WCQ away H2Hs vs Brazil.

They’re yet to lose to any opposition since finishing third in the previous Copa América but have won just four of seven matches as favorites across all venues. As far as this World Cup qualifying edition is concerned, Argentina have made their presence felt early by scoring before halftime in all four fixtures and thus haven’t suffered a first-half deficit on any occasion as a result. Chilean fans have every right to feel a little pessimistic about this clash considering the visitors haven’t defeated Argentina inside 90 minutes since 2008. On a positive, however, they’ve restricted Lionel Scaloni’s side to a one-goal margin in their five most recent 90-minute head-to-head losses. Their form since the previous Copa América couldn't have been more mixed as interestingly, the final result has been different to the previous match in all nine games played during that time.

This may lead to a combative game, so it’s noteworthy that there’s been three red cards across Peru’s last three home games. Colombia’s own sluggish start to the World Cup qualifying campaign may also put the emphasis on pragmatic play across the field. They will, however, take encouragement from going unbeaten in nine H2Hs overall, during which they only conceded two goals. Colombia’s 6-1 defeat to lower-ranked Ecuador in their last away match was the nation’s first time conceding 6+ goals since 1977.
