Jamal's wife Amira says she doesn't recognise Amber Ray as her co-wife. Socialite Amber Ray announced she was engaged to Nairobi businessman Jamal ‘Rohosafi’ Marlow early this year at a private family function. Jamal later confirmed the news on Instagram by sharing photos of their engagement. He captioned it, "It’s official", to which Amber Ray reacted with three love emojis and a caption, "My husband." In a recent TV interview, Amira said, "To start, I have not seen any wedding documents yet, so I do not have a co-wife. We see them posting everything about their lives all over social media, from what they are eating, what they are dressing and even where they are, but I have not seen them posting any legal document of their wedding." Jamal identifies Amber as his legal wife.
