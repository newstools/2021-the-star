A woman charged with hacking her neighbour’s thighs in Kawangware has pleaded guilty to the charges and told the court that she did it as an act of defence. Sandra Tamara pleaded guilty to assaulting Margaret Musiko before Kibera senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua on Monday and said that her head was almost chopped off by the complainant. The charge sheet says that she assaulted Musiko on June 6 in Kawangware within Nairobi county. Court prosecutor Kinuthia Njenga while reading the court facts told the court that the duo lived in the same neighborhood. He said that on that day Tamara was called outside by Musiko where an argument ensued which saw the two engage in a bitter exchange of words. Despite being close neighbours, the two failed to solve their differences and the matter was taken to the court. Kinuthia told the court that  Tamara then went into her room, grabbed a panga and slashed the victim’s thigh. The court heard that the complainant screamed for help attracting the neighbours who held Tamara just when she attempted to hack her chest for the second time. Musiko was rushed to Mums Hospital where she was treated and discharged and issued with a P3 form. She later reported the matter to the police which led to Tamara's arrest. The magistrate ordered her to pay Sh20,000 or face six-month imprisonment if she defaults.
