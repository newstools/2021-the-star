Cases of indiscipline in the boda boda sector in Kwale county have gone down compared to last year, police records show. County police commander Steve Oloo said the majority of boda boda operators are gradually becoming disciplined, following frequent peaceful engagements with the police. Police in the region have developed a weekly programme aimed at bringing order and sanity to the sector. Oloo said since the programme was launched, they have managed to neutralise the enmity between police and boda boda riders. "Nowadays boda bodas do not fear police like they used to, because we have made them realise we are friends and we are here to help," he said. Oloo spoke in an interview in his office in Matuga subcounty. He said the programme seeks to collect data on legitimate riders and train them on how to look presentable to address insecurity issues. Officers also train riders on safety measures and the need to abide by the law. The operators are equipped with saving skills and urged to enrol into driving schools to get the required licences. Many boda bodas in the region do not have licences or insurance covers, are linked to teenage pregnancy, criminal activities and ride recklessly, leading to many road accidents. In 2020, over 200 cases of road accidents were reported in the region and a large percentage of them involved boda boda riders and tuk-tuk drivers. Many young, inexperienced riders get killed or injured while speeding or avoiding police at roadblocks. Last year, three minors riding on a motorcycle were crushed to death by a canter while trying to overtake along the Likoni-Ukunda road. However, the majority have become cautious on roads and do not take part in criminal activities. Oloo warned that the police will take stern actions against those who violate the law and traffic rules. Edited by A.N
