Reigning champions Equity Bank beat Storms 68-55 in a women's Premier League clash at the University of Nairobi courts. It was Storms who got off to a bright start after Celia Atieno opening three-point shot. They did well to maintain a 21-14 first-quarter edge. But Equity Bank rallied superbly in the second taking a 20-12 cushion of their own for a close 34-33 advantage at the breather. Six early points by Salma Akinyi as the third quarter started ignited the winners before a three-point play by Annerose Mandela made the scores 61-46. Bety Kananu led Equity Bank with 14 points while Salma scored 11.Â  Stephie Ngabire registered 12 for the losers, down 13-12 in the last quarter. "We were sluggish from the start but we managed to change our strategy, putting Salma inside and this worked out well for us in the second and third quarters. This is only our second game after the resumption and we will get better as we continue," said the bankers' coach Sylvia Kamau. Storms coach Abel Nson noted: "The difference was inside where they had an edge with my two post players having problems marking Salma." "I promise a different game in the second leg. We will give them a good game and they also know it." The bankers had 17 points from Samba Mjomba and 16 from Betty Kananu as they dimmed Eagle Wings 69-42 the previous day. In another match, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) walloped visiting Eldonets 49-38.
