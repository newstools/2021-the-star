Seven-time world rally champion Sebastien Ogier says he is overly excited with the new experience that WRC Safari Rally will have to offer this week. Ogier, who will be making his debut in Africa for Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT arrived last evening in a private jet accompanied by his Hyundai Motorsport WRT counterpart Ott Tanak who is also the 2019 world champion. Tomorrow, drivers will get their first feel of the route when they recce Malewa, Loldia, and Hell's Gate which is the designated Power Stage. On Tuesday, they will recce the Elementeita and Soysambu Conservancy side where the roughest stage (Sleeping Warrior) is situated. On his part, Ogier reiterated that tyres will play a major role in Safari supremacy battles given the nature of the tough Kenyan terrain. "I'm overly excited to be here in Kenya where I will be rallying for the first time. To my fans, stay safe, observe the Covid protocols as we will try our level best to deliver the Safari title," Ogier said. Estonian Tanak who has had a bad season said: "It's always a great feeling to try out new terrain. We are giving this one out best shot following our retirement in Italy. Above all, we are looking forward to the Safari adventure." Ogier currently leads the WRC log with an 11 point cushion over Hyundai's Thierry Neuville of Belgium. All has not been well for Tanak, who has indicated that he will follow a different strategy for the remainder of the FIA World Rally Championship season after retiring from the lead for the second time in consecutive rallies in Italy. The Estonian lies 57 points adrift of championship leader SÃ©bastien Ogier with seven of the 12 rounds remaining. He lost a comfortable lead at Rally Italia Sardegna earlier in the month when he hit a rock and ripped the right rear wheel from his Hyundai i20. It followed a similar disappointment last month when a shattered suspension forced him out of Vodafone Rally de Portugal en route to victory .
