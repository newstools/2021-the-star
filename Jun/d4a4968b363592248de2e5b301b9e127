Upcoming gospel singer Lydia Maina has dropped her latest single, 'Usukani'. Lydia says it is about letting God take charge in all we do. The Eldoret-based artiste has been in the industry for a while and has three tracks to her name. "The song was inspired by the times we are in. We are facing very difficult times as a nation due to the coronavirus pandemic. "People have lost their loved ones, jobs and livelihoods with no one to turn to. It is time we let God take control (usukani) and save our land." Last year, she released 'Imani', a song about faith. Her plan for the next part of the year is to continue releasing more songs and also feature various local and international gospel acts.
