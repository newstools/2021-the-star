Laikipia county has presented a Sh8.1 billion budget for the 2021-22 financial year. Health, infrastructure and the county assembly will receive the lion's share of the budget at Sh2.1 billion, Sh1.7 billion and Sh536 million respectively. Public administration will get Sh700 million, while finance and water departments are allocated Sh391 million and Sh443 million respectively. Finance executive Murungi Ndai on Friday announced that the estimates had been forwarded to the county assembly for consideration. Ndai said education, agriculture and trade will get Sh463 million, Sh264 million and Sh112 million respectively. Other county entities will share the balance. He said that since the outbreak of Covid-19 15 months ago, many businesses have been hit hard, with some closing up shop. This has since watered down efforts previously made to improve the economy. “These tough times have necessitated the county government to align its 2021-22 programmes purposely to address the urgent needs of the citizens,” Ndai said. He said the two major county hospitals—Nanyuki and Nyahururu—will get Sh160.7 million and Sh140.7 million respectively. To cater for the very poor in society, Sh30 million has been set aside as National Health Insurance Fund subsidies, while Sh33 million will be used as stipends for community health volunteers. And to ensure liquidity in the market, Sh700 million has been set aside to offset pending bills in all departments. “The enterprise and cooperative development funds will get Sh20 million, while an additional Sh30 million will be added to financial institutions to unlock Sh3 billion as loans to the business sector,” Ndai said. He said the Sh1.2 billion infrastructure allocation will go towards a leasing programme, while Sh280 million will grade and gravel 60 kilometres of roads in each of the 15 wards. Water companies—Nawasco and Nyahuwasco— will be enhanced to increase the  area under irrigation from 5,000 acres in 2019 to 50,000 acres. The county set aside Sh933 million for the upgrade of town centres and markets to spur economic activities by attracting investment in enterprises, manufacturing, service provision and tourism. Sh23 million will be used to equip the youth with the required skills and acquisition and construction of culverts to address drainage issues. Ndai noted that county revenues majorly comprise the equitable share from the National Treasury at Sh5.1 billion, own-source revenue at Sh1 billion and conditional grants at Sh750 million. He said the county is well prepared to raise Sh1.1 billion from infrastructure bond transactions, bringing the total county revenue to Sh8.1 billion. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
