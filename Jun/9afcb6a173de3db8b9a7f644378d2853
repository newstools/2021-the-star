The Kenya Railways has issued a statement after a cargo caught fire in Sagana, Murang'a county. According to Kenya Railways, the fire on the petroleum train from Nanyuki to Nairobi was caused by an electric fault in the train's engine. "The fire was caused by a slight electric fault in the locomotive engine and has since been contained. Our engineers arrived at the area promptly and rectified the problem," Kenya Railways tweeted on Sunday. The fire brigade from Murang'a County quickly responded to help contain the situation and service is expected to resume once a full inspection on the train is completed. The train caught fire minutes after it left the Sagana station and no casualties have been reported from the incident. This comes even as the government has been working to revive the country's dead capital which includes renovating of more than 500 kilometers of the meter gauge railway. In January, a Nairobi bound train stalled in Ruthagati, Nyeri after it developed a mechanical problem. This was later resolved after some minutes. The train had more than 1,500 passengers onboard.
