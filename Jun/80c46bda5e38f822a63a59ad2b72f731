President Uhuru Kenyatta has arrived in Kitui for the official launch of the Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Protection in Museve. A statement from State House said the event graced by the Head of State will also include the dedication of the Shrine constructed by the Catholic Church. "The Marian Shrine was developed by the Catholic Diocese of Kitui to serve as a privileged place of prayer, retreat and recollections," the statement said. The President who was accompanied to Kitui by Cabinet Secretary for Defence, Monica Juma was received by Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Kitui governor Charity Ngilu among other local leaders. This comes a few days to Uhuruâ€™s expected tour of the Ukambani region. During a meeting with Lower Eastern region leaders at State House on June 14, Uhuru said he will visit the region on June 28 and 29. The two-day development tour will see the Uhuru visit Machakos and Makueni counties on June 28 and June 29. In Makueni, the President will begin his tour at the Konza Technopolis in Makueni before proceeding to inspect the Thwake Dam project and later launch Kibwezi-Kitui road. Uhuru will inspect ongoing government projects and launch new ones in a bid to pacify the region, which has complained about being ignored since the 2018 handshake deal between Uhuru and ODM leader Raila Odinga.
