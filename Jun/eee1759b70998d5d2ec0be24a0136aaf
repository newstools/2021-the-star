Traders within Ndagani in Chuka town have been cautioned against engaging in the sale of drugs and illicit brews. The order aims to provide a conducive learning environment at the nearby Chuka University. Tharaka Nithi county commissioner Beverly Opwora on Friday said her security team will not sit back and watch a few unscrupulous people destroy the lives of students pursuing various courses at the university. “It’s high time that those selling drugs and illicit liquor within Ndagani tried other profitable businesses, else they will soon be forced to close shop after being apprehended and prosecuted in courts of law,” Opwora said. The county commissioner was speaking during an event to upgrade Ndagani Primary School into a model centre of excellence in the eastern region. Chuka University vice chancellor Prof Erastus Njoka said with the rapid expansion of the institution, children from all over the world will come to Ndagani and it would be very unfortunate if they find the place prone to drugs. “We are not bringing children here to be taught how to be useless in their future engagements, as drugs render one a zombie after destroying nerves. Anyone selling drugs around here should know they are in the wrong place,” Njoka said. Drug dealers are only interested in making money without considering the grave effects narcotics had on the users, he said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
