Film director Kwame Nyong’o's four-minute film on the universal scourge of plastic pollution, 'Flipflopi', has been accepted to Annecy in competition. Kwame, who scripted and narrated said the film, was specifically targeting young children as crucial warriors in the battle against it. "The wonderful story of Aisha, Ali and FlipFlopi, the multi-coloured dhow boat, has since gained a special jury selection in its category for this year’s edition of the world’s largest animated film festival." Fliflopi is the first Kenyan short film to be accepted to Annecy competition. The festival will run from June 14 to June 19. Kwame tells fresh stories from Africa that are often not shown, giving positive and uplifting narratives of today's continent.
