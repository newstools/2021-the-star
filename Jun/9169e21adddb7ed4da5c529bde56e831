President Uhuru Kenyatta has put on notice leaders fueling inter-clan conflict and blaming it on terrorism. According to the Head of State who spoke in Ngong on Wednesday, the government has every intention to fight al Shabaab, but leaders fueling conflicts will not be tolerated. "We do not and will never allow leaders and individuals to use the name of al Shabaab to continue inter-clan animosities and conflicts," Uhuru said. The president noted the security of our country is not just a collective responsibility but also our individual responsibility. Uhuru reiterated the importance of peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue, stating that the government is willing to engage all Kenyan citizens in such endeavours. He added that peace can only be achieved if all Kenyans work together. "A peaceful Kenya, a united Kenya is for the good of all of us," Uhuru added. On Wednesday, Uhuru presided over the burning of 5,144 illegal firearms and obsolete state-owned small arms and light weapons at the Regional Traffic Police Training Centre in Ngong, Kajiado County. During the event, Uhuru called on those operating in the underworld, making homemade guns to instead join the government firearms factory. He said the manufacturers of the illegal guns have skills that can be used at the newly opened small arms factory in Ruiru, Kiambu County. “This is to those making illegal guns, come we make legal money and jobs. Come forward and declare you can make a gun and you will get a job. Don’t wait for police to come for you,” Uhuru said.
