Gengetone artiste Kartelo has called upon Kenyans to support Gengetone artistes. In an Instagram video, Kartelo decried criticism and judgment to upcoming artistes, saying they are working to have better lives. "These are young people trying to earn a living and change their livelihood for the better. Guide them in this course," he said. "Are you a witch to celebrate someone else's fall? People need to understand that they cannot kill that movement. You all stop being bad people and support these kids," he said. Kartelo further urged Kenyans to create a favourable environment for these young people to grow and prosper. "You can’t stop the dream, Gengetone to the world." Kartelo came into the limelight over his prowess in speaking the ‘sheng’ language in his short comedy skits.
