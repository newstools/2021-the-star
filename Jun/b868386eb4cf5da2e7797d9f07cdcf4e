IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati has clarified that the commission is not planning to remove any of the constituencies from the current ones. In a statement on Thursday, Chebukati said that the news that spread during the day claiming that the 26 constituencies will be scrap off was misreported. “In regard to misreporting that the commission is planning to scrap the 26 protected constituencies, the commission wishes to clarify that until the boundaries review process is concluded, all the existing 290 constituencies remain as they are,” Chebukati said. The earlier information had claimed that the commission might remove at least 26 constituencies that were protected in the last boundaries review is not true. Chebukati added that the recently launched 2020-2024 Strategic Elections, Operations Plan (EOP), and Boundaries Review Operations Plan (BROP) do clearly outlines legal timelines that will guide the implementation of various activities. He added that the commission had requested a budget of Sh40.4 billion but the National Treasury allocated Sh26.5 billion to it for elections and boundaries review during the presentation of the current financial year. “In the financial year, 2021-2022 the commission has been allocated Sh14.5 billion out of which Sh4.5 billion is for recurrent and capital expenditure leaving Sh10 billion for elections and boundaries review.” He added that the commission will conclude the boundaries delimitation exercise within the legally provided timelines. On Tuesday 8, the commission unveiled the Boundaries Review plan, where it has increased the population quota from 133,000 to 164,015. This means that any constituency that does not meet the population quota will cease to exist after the commission concludes the boundaries review by March 2024. The population quota is arrived at by dividing the national population of 47.5 million by 290 constituencies stipulated in the Constitution.
