Gaspo Women ended Vihiga Queens' dominance by beating them 5-3 in post-match penalties to book their place in the Kenya Women's Premier League final set for Sunday in Nakuru. The Isaac Maluki-tutored side finally broke their winless duck against Vihiga Queens following a 1-1 draw. Gaspo have lost the last four meetings against the defending champions. Queens won the title in 2017, 2018, and 2019 and were almost sure of winning the title for the fourth unprecedented title before the shocker. Vihiga goalkeeper Lilian Awour was sent off early in the second half. Gaspo team manager Edward Githua said his players were psyched up for the match and their progress was as a result of the collective team effort. "The players wanted to prove a point. This is one of the sweetest victories of the season because we had never won against them. Fighting all the way to the finals gives us the belief that this could be our year to be crowned champions,” he said. “We have now broken the jinx and we have a realistic chance of laying our hands on the first trophy. There's no better way to end the season than beating the defending champion," Githua observed. Queens' coach Alex Alumira said errors coupled with profligacy in front of goal was the team's main undoing. "We made some defensive mistakes and the red card compounded our problems. Awuor's dismissal came at the wrong time. We could not convert the chances that we created and it really cost us. I am nonetheless not worried because I believe it was just a bad day in the office," he said. "We will come back stronger with the FKF Women's Cup and the Cecafa regional tournament which acts as qualifiers to the Caf Champions League, “ he stated. Star striker Tereza Engesha played and missed from the spot. Alumira had on Thursday ruled her out of the match because of an injury she suffered three weeks ago. Engesha has scored 15 goals this season.
