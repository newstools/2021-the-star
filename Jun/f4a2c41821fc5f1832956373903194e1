Police are interrogating three suspects after a gang robbed two Chinese contractors of Sh6 million at Kariminu (II) Dam site in Gatundu North, Kiambu county. The suspects include a watchman at the site and a driver of a contractor. Investigations are ongoing into the Saturday morning robbery. Kiambu county police commander Ali Nuno said the thugs, who were armed with pistols, could have gained entry through a tunnel used for water supply. Officials involved in the operation said the gang had split up after sharing their loot but they are following leads on their whereabouts. The search for the gang has spread to Nairobi following a tip-off. The contractors told police they were at their home in Gatundu North, when the robbers entered the house through a water drainage tunnel at 1am. The money was to be used to pay suppliers for goods. The gang escaped. Police said the believe the gang knew there was money in the house. Nuno said no recovery has been made so far but added, "the suspects may give good leads." The robbery did not stop work on the dam. The dam was recommended for development as one of the sources to supply water to Ruiru-Juja towns and the adjoining areas. It is being constructed across the Kariminu River. Kariminu II Dam is being implemented under the Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Financing framework (EPC-F). The project is a joint venture between M/s AVIC International Holding Corporation and M/s Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute (Smedi) with financing from the China Exim Bank and the Government of Kenya. The Sh24 billion contract was signed on May 9, 2014, while construction works commenced in May 2019 and are scheduled to be completed by May, 2022, officials say. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
