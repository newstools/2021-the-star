Police in Lamu have are holding a National Police Reservist after his rifle was stolen in an apparent burglary in his house a few days ago. Bernard Ng’ang’a, 56, and a resident of Bakanja area in Mpeketoni Lamu west, has served as police reservist for over 10 years. He alleges that his house was broken into by unknown people last Friday at round 4pm who made away with the loaded AK-47 gun and other household items. Mpeketoni OCPD Harrison Njuguna said the man remains in custody even as officers pursue leads to recover the rifle. The man is being held at the Mpeketoni police station. He called on members of the public to give any information that could lead to the recovery of the gun. “He alleges that it was stolen during a burglary. We are holding him as our officers try to chase some leads. Our biggest worry is that the rifle could be in the hands of dangerous people. We hope the public helps us on this," said Njuguna. Meanwhile, NPR officers operating in terror-prone areas in the region have asked the government to issue them with sophisticated guns saying the older version of the G-3 ones can’t help much in case of an al Shabaab invasions. The officers say they are the first to encounter terror attacks when they happen even before the police and military respond and that it is therefore prudent for them to have better guns. In July, 2014, gunmen raided Pandanguo village in Lamu, torched houses, schools and robbed NPR officers of six guns. In 2015, over 60 NPR’s in Lamu quit their jobs and returned their guns citing poor machinery and pay. -Edited by SKanyara
