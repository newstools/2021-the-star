The Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers has lashed out at the Salaries and Remuneration Commission for recommending a two-year freeze of pay rise. Union members in Taita Taveta on Wednesday opposed SRC's unilateral decision and urged the Teachers Service Commission to resume negotiations on salary increment. “There is need for the TSC to table a counter-offer and resume CBA negotiations with the union. We reject in totality the SRC advisory on salary increment freeze for two years,” Kuppet executive Shedrack Mutungi said. He said that during a consultative meeting, teachers  agreed to stand with the union’s national executive board’s decision that the TSC resume negotiations and give a new offer on increment of pay and allowances. The teachers want the SCR to withdraw the advisory and leave the two parties to negotiate the 2021-25 CBA without interruptions. “Teachers are demoralised by the SRC's reckless statement of locking salary reviews by use of non-factual parameters," Mutungi said. “Teachers are tired and ready for industrial action if negotiations fail. We are waiting for the signal.” A salary increment is necessary to cushion teachers against inflation, high cost of living and growing burden of increased workload due to the competence-based curriculum, he said. The executive also asked the Kenya National Examination Council to immediately pay examiners who marked the 2020 KCSE exam in Nairobi. “Because teachers love their country, they took the highest risk and delivered on this national duty at a time when Nairobi and its environs had the highest cases of Covid-19,” he said. He advised that in future, teachers be paid immediately upon completion of the marking process. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
