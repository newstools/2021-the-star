Kenya Forest Service team will miss the services of veteran left attacker Blasio Kokonya with youngster Michael Wanyoike preferred as the league returnees tackle Vihiga County and Kenya Prisons this weekend. Kokonya, a former international who also turned up for Kenya Prisons, has been a peripheral figure since he returned to the side. It was hoped he will reclaim his spot after returning to full fitness but impressive prospect Wanyoike who was a class act during the second leg in Nanyuki will continue in his role according to coach Wachira Gathweria. "Wanyoike has done well since he came in and I'll stick with him going forward. He was outstanding in Nanyuki and there's no need to drop him. He is feeling confident and we have to trust him because he is the future of the team," he said. "Kokonya is one of our experienced players but he's not played much since he returned to the team. He remains a vital member of the playing unit and his services will be required if we qualify for the playoffs." Gathweria also confirmed that injured middle blocker Stephen Muremi won't be available as he continues with rehabilitation. Vincent Twara replaces him. "Muremi is out but in Twara we have a player who is ready for the challenge," he observed. KFS are placed sixth in the 13-team league and boasts 11 points from six matches after registering four wins and two losses. The tactician said his charges will put a brave show after training together for the last couple of weeks â€” an opportunity he said was missing at the start of the season. "Most of my players were not available when we started but we are a full house now. There's reason for optimism in regards to improved performance. We have tried to adjust based on our last performance. Backcourt defending is an area we have put emphasis on," said Gathweria.
