Still in recovery from a serious single-car crash in February, Tiger Woods declined an invitation to provide commentary for the June 17-20 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego. News that Woods was offered and rejected the assignment came during a conference call with NBC Sports broadcasters who will call the action at the third major tournament of the year. “... Who better, if he couldn’t be there to play it, to voice it and have him a part of the show,” NBC’s Dan Hicks said. “But we were rebuffed.” Playing on an injured left knee, Woods won the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines in an 18-hole playoff that went one extra hole. Woods clinched the victory with a par 4 on the seventh hole. “He didn’t want to do it, and I totally understand his situation,” Hicks said. “There is a lot going on in his world right now and there’s also a part of Tiger that doesn’t want to become this, I don’t want to, for lack of a better word, a sideshow at an event where we should be concentrating on what’s happening.” Woods is a 15-time major winner, with his most recent title coming at the 2019 Masters. He has won the U.S. Open three times, also taking the title in 2000 and 2002. Jack Nicklaus has the record for most victories in a major with 18. In a Feb. 23 car crash at Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., just outside of Los Angeles, Woods veered off the road in an SUV loaned to him by the Genesis Invitational golf tournament at Riviera Country Club. The 45-year-old underwent surgery for multiple leg injuries and has been in recovery ever since.
