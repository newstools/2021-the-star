Rwanda will host the Fiba Africa Zone Five women qualifiers, regional secretary Vitalis Gode confirmed on Wednesday. Gode said Kenya's initial interest in the tournament fizzled out even before they could make arrangements leaving Kigali the sole contender to stage the event. Egypt were initially set to host the tournament but withdrew month to the event. "If Kenya had bid, they would have won it outrightly but as things stand, Kigali have the honours," he said adding: "After Egypt withdrew, Fiba Africa were desperately looking for a host and Kenya had a good chance but the truth is, they didn't place a bid." He gave the tentative dates for the five-day event as July 12-15. It will be the third time Rwanda is hosting a continental show in less than a year. Already, Kenya Lionesses are training at the Nyayo Stadium gymnasium under Uganda-based coach George Mayienga. Meanwhile, Mayienga has expressed his worries since only two foreign-based players are training with the team. Spain-based Mercy Wanyama and Victoria Wanjara who plies trade in the US have reported for training with the event just weeks away. Mayienga expects the rest of the overseas-based players to link up with the team this week. Among those expected are Felmas Koranga (USA),Â  Georgia Adhiambo (Rwanda) Rose Ouma (Dubai), Brenda Wasuda (USA) and Purity Auma (Bangladesh). Kenya will battle favourites Egypt, Rwanda, Burundi, debutants South Sudan and Tanzania for the sole ticket to Cameroon in September.
