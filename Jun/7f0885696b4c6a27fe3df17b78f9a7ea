A suspected al Shabaab militant was fatally shot on Wednesday morning in Bombo area of Matunga in Kwale county. According to a police report seen by the Star, the unidentified suspect was killed by an elite police unit during an early morning raid at their hideout. Two suspects escaped with gunshot wounds. Kwale police commander Steve Oloo confirmed the incident. “Officers from an elite unit were acting on an intelligence report,” the police report states. Oloo said the suspects were planning to attack a security establishment within Kwale county with an intention of acquiring firearms. He said the militants were targeting Diani police station and the Kombani roadblock. Police recovered an AK-47 rifle, over 700 bullets, a laptop, a flash disk, nine different types of mobile phones, two measuring jars, a funnel, a conical flask and 100gm of magnesium metal powder. Other items included a rubber water bottle, a box of filter paper, an MP3 player, three bulbs and a note with a list of targeted areas. “We suspect that the chemical was to be used to make explosives,” Oloo said.
