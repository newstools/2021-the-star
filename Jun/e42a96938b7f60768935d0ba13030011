Kenya Police missed out on a golden chance to topple Talanta from the apex of the National Super League after playing out to a two-all draw against Modern Coast in the only match of the day at Camp Toyoyo, Nairobi. The Monday results took them to 40 points, one adrift of leaders Talanta and three clear of Shabana who crushed 2-1 away to Kibera Black Stars at Ligi Ndogo on Sunday. The law enforcers got their goals through Samuel Githire and Arvine Odoyo with their opponents replying via Ian Owiti and Innocent Kiprotich. Modern Coast, who were 17th on the log prior to the match, have now ascended to 14th with 27 points, effectively putting behind their relegation worries, albeit for a while.
