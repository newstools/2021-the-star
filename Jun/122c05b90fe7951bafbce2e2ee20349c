Residents living along the Lamu-Garsen road have faulted the Kenya National Highways Authority for failing to instal drainage systems and kerbs. They said runoff water from the road flows directly into their homes during the rainy season, leading to flooding. The Sh10.8 billion 114-kilometre Lamu-Witu-Garsen road was opened by President Uhuru Kenyatta on May 20 this year, the same day he opened the new Lamu Port. Residents want Kenha to compensate all those whose properties have been destroyed by floods as a result of lack of drainage systems. Elder Mohamed Bwanamkuu of Mokowe town in Lamu West said most houses are now uninhabitable. “We are glad for the road but then again we have no homes because of lack of drainage systems. Water flows into our homes any time it rains. We have people whose homes have been swept away by floods. Kenha should correct this and compensate us,” he said. Abdi Galgalo complained that lack of kerbs and culverts means water from the road is directed to homes and business premises. Other affected areas include Mokowe, Hindi, Pangani, Sabasaba, Ndeu, Mkunumbi, Koreni, Kibaoni, Majembeni and Witu. Kenha manager in charge of the Lamu-Witu-Garsen road project Eng Ezekiel Fukwo defended the authority, saying the said areas were already prone to flooding even before the road construction commenced. He said most towns and market centres in these areas have been built on waterways. Fukwo said the contractor has been trying to address the situation. “As a long-term measure, the supervising consultant is coming up with a comprehensive plan to address the matter, which will be dealt with separately as a new contract,” he said.
