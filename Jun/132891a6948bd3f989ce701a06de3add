Detectives arrested three more suspects on Friday in connection with the fake jobs syndicate in an operation that started two weeks ago. The syndicate has been luring hundreds of innocent and desperate job seekers who are believed to have lost over Sh200 million in the scam, after being promised jobs in various government parastatals including key government security agencies. Two of the suspects arrested today include Senior Sergeant Jackson Mureithi Manyara and Corporal Zachary Kimathi Cosmas, are prison officers believed to have been recruited by the main suspect Grace Nyamohanga, Sergeant Mureithi had collected Sh19 million from 74 jobseekers, and Corporal Kimathi collected Sh5.7 million from 20 jobless Kenyans, totaling Sh24.7 million. The third suspect Peter Ngere Githu based in Juja recruited 50 jobseekers and collected Sh16 million from them. The three will be arraigned on Monday alongside Grace Nyamohanga and Masiaga Slyvester, for obtaining money by false pretenses, making documents without authority, altering false documents, and conspiracy to defraud among other charges. Late last month, Senior Sergeant Grace Nyamohanga, alias ‘Nasra’ surrendered herself to the Serious Crime detectives at DCI headquarters. The sleuths suspected Nasra to be in charge of a wide syndicate that has swindled Kenyan’s hundreds of millions of shillings.
