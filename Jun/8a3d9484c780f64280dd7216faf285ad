The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company will shut down the water supply along the Uhuru Highway due to ongoing construction of the Expressway. The shut down will start from 6.00 am on Thursday, June 17 to Friday, June 18, at 6.00 am. “This will facilitate interconnection of the new and old water pipelines on Uhuru highway between Museum Hill and KBC area to enable the release of the road median to the Expressway road contractor,” MD Nahason Muguna said. Areas to be affected include; the whole city centre, areas along Mombasa Road, South B and South C areas and the neighbourhoods. Others are; University of Nairobi main campus, the Coca Cola factory, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, the whole Industrial Area, areas along Jogoo Road, City Stadium, Maringo, Bahati, Buruburu and the surrounding areas. “We appeal to our customers for indulgence and also urge them to use available water sparingly as we work restoring the supply,” Muguna said. Last month, Muguna said city residents will not suffer severe water rationing as there is enough supply until the short rains begin. Muguna said all the dams supplying the city are full. The company supplies the city with 525,000 cubic meters per day against a demand of 830,000 cubic meters. This leaves a deficit of over 305, 000 cubic meters. The Northern Collector Tunnel is expected to bring an additional 140,000 cubic metres per day. The project is derived from the Nairobi Water Master Plan for Developing New Water Sources for Nairobi and 13 Satellite Towns. These towns include Kikuyu, Ruiru-Juja, Kiambu, Karuri, Githunguri, Mavoko, Ngong, Ongata Rongai, Thika, Gatundu, Limuru, Lari and Tala-Kangundo. The Northern Collector Tunnel Phase I includes river diversion and related intake hydraulic structures at Maragua, Gikigie and Irati Rivers as well as the construction of a river outlet at Githika River which will convey the additional water to Thika dam.
