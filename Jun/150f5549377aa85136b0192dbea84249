Wadadia Ladies coach Godfrey Mabonga said the 6-0 loss to Nakuru on Sunday was down to bad decisions by the match officials and has no bearing in their remaining match. Wadadia, who are second with 25 points — succumbed to their heaviest defeat this season at the Showground, Nakuru — with the coach labeling the officiating 'catastrophic'. Mabonga said the official's decision to award three penalties — two in a span of five minutes — dampened their spirits. "Some decisions have gone against us this season but on Sunday the referee's judgement was catastrophic. How can you award a spot-kick when it is evident that the opponent handled the ball? Even some of those spot-kicks are questionable," he lamented. "The level of concentration ebbed away and my players looked dejected after the final whistle. We spoke after the match and we will bounce back stronger. Competing parties deserve equal treatment and referees should not be one-sided." Wadadia took solace after national team coach Charles Okere comforted the girls after the match, a good gesture from the tactician according to Mabonga. "The defeat weighed on the players even forcing coach Okere to address the team. This was a good gesture from the tactician and you could see smiles on the girls' faces after that," he added. Both teams have already booked playoff slots but for Nakuru, it was sweet revenge after losing 3-1 in the first leg in Mumias.
