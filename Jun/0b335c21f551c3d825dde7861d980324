Infinix recently launched its NOTE 10 Series in a never seen launch of a smartphone in the country at the Ali Barbour’s Cave Restaurant, in Diani Beach. The choice in location the brand says was influenced by its mission to stay true to its rebranding goals of being trendy. Most brands tend to do a short offline launch or an online launch of their devices. Over the years, as the Kenyan market has been constantly flooded with new smartphone entrants, the pressure to stand out is important. Infinix Mobile is an emerging smartphone brand that designs, manufactures and markets an expanding portfolio of mobile devices worldwide under the Infinix brand which was founded back in 2013. At the launch, being first, the brand went all out and gave an amazing experience. The entire cave restaurant was beautifully illuminated with flashy lights and laser light mapping that evoked an outer space futuristic experience. The big unveil was carefully set in one of the interlinking chambers, with the Note 10 display phones carefully seating on giant seashells surrounded with mystical smoke. The NOTE 10 series creates the perfect viewing experience with a 6.95” full high definition (FHD+) display, and a 91% screen-to-body ratio with 500 nits of peak brightness and 1500:1 colour contrast ratio for sharp, crystal clear visuals. Graphics and images seamlessness glide due to the 90Hz refresh rate and 180Hz touch sampling rate, which is perfect for watching movies, scrolling content or gaming. To capture amazing selfies, the NOTE 10 series is equipped with a 16MP AI Beautify Selfie front-facing camera with two frontal flashes. The Note 10 Pro and NOTE 10 Pro NFC are loaded with an intuitive AI-powered four-in-one lens comprising 120° field of view (FOV) ultra-wide angle, super macro lens, 5P lens, black and white lens and portrait lens, which are all integrated into a rear-facing 64 megapixels (MP) 6P ultra night camera.
