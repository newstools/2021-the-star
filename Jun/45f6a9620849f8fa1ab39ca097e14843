Tanzanian singer Nandy on Saturday received a call from President Samia Suluhu during a live performance in Dodoma. An excited Nandy put the phone on speaker for all her fans to hear. "I am on official duty in Dar es Salam, if not I would be with you today. May you have a nice show, let all Tanzanians enjoy I am thankful that today as I mark day 100 in office, you are in Dodoma to entertain the youth, tell them I love them so much," Suluhu told the crowd. Nandy could not hide her joy. "Your phone call on Nandy Festival Dodoma is a sign of respect for artists. You have given respect to youths who are working their way up. I kneel down to thank you, Mum. Me and my fellow artists are elated. Thank you so much mum," she said. Barely two weeks ago, Suluhu gave Rayvanny a gift. In a video posted on his Instagram page, Rayvanny was seen running all over his house, flaunting an envelope that contained the recognition from the President. "I am so happy today. I got a present from my mum, my President. It has been written, on government service economy. I am so thankful to my President for this, and I will keep it as a memory. It really encourages us (artists) to keep working hard. It means a lot to me."
