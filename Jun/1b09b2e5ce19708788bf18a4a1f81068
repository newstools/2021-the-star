Young talented players are being recruited to be part of the upcoming Duke Abuya Sports Academy in Eldoret. The Nkana FC midfielder is set to build a modern sports academy in Eldoret to nurture Kenya’s best footballer talent at the lower cadre. Abuya, who started his football career with Division 2 side, GFE 105 in Eldoret, also played for Mathare United and Kariobangi Sharks. Abuya said setting up the foundation is his way of giving back not only to community but also the county that nurtured him. "Since I grew up in Uasin Gishu county and played my football here, I have decided to start a football centre that will help nurture young talent from grassroots,” said Abuya. Despite his involvement with his team away in Zambia, Abuya has continued to use football legends on the ground to facilitate his activities on the ground. “I grew up without a training centre and I don't want the current generation to go through the same,” explained Abuya. He said the purpose of the soccer centre is to grow, mould and help the talented kids realise their dreams. “I am planning to build and develop a centre where the kids will be camping, boarding and schooling at the same time,” he said. So far, the recruitment has begun at the Eldoret Discipleship College, where more than 60 teens aged between 6 to 15 years turned up in search of the opportunity to join the centre. “We have managed to pick players born from 2008 so that we can have under 14 and bellow. We have picked 24 kids who are scheduled to start official training,” he said. We also urge well-wisher to support the foundation," he added.
