Police in Isinya have arrested two suspects in Ulu area and are holding them for questioning over the loss of 2,600 Dorper sheep in the last four months. The suspected cattle rustlers were arrested on Friday after allegedly stealing cows from the home of prominent farmer Joel Pashile on Wednesday night. Residents of Olturoto, Kitengela and Kisaju areas of Isinya expressed joy at the arrest of the suspects as the theft of their livestock has impoverished them. In Kitengela, Olturoto and Kisaju alone, farmers have lost almost 3,000 Dorper sheep. None has been recovered. Isinya subcounty police boss Ben Changulo said the suspects are in police custody and will assist the officers resolve the mystery of livestock theft in the area. “We are trying to follow these incidents but looks like those assisting the rustlers are people who know the area very much,” Changulo said last week after a farmer in Kitengela lost 40 sheep. The latest incident happened in the only manyatta in Kitengela town centre, where Samuel Legei lost 40 Dorper sheep. Legei, a father of two, said his children have been sent for lack fees. “I have nowhere to go. The schools say we must pay fees,” Legei said. Known for its quality mutton, Dorper sheep can weigh up to 90kg in body weight as compared to the local red Maasai sheep. A pure Dorper sheep breed can fetch up to Sh30,000. This means that with only 10 of them in the market, a farmer can walk home with Sh300,000. Almost four days earlier, John Mutunkei lost 26 Dorper sheep from his farm in the Sifa area of Kitengela, behind GK Prisons. “At the beginning of the year, I had 600 Dorper sheep, and after raiders invaded our farms, I decided to sell them and was left with 126 but they came and took 26 of them recently,” Mutunkei said. Mutunkei said rustlers are now walking freely during the day as they survey their targets and strike at night.  (edited by o. owino)
