More than 1,000 families of Dzendereni in Kinango subcounty in Kwale have benefited from a new Sh1.2 million borehole. Kinango is an arid area which has for many years been affected by drought and acute water shortage. The 200-metre-deep borehole is sponsored by Kuwaiti donor Mira Swaleh in partnership with Relief Organization of East Africa and the Kwale county government. It has a huge water tank and a diesel-powered pump that supplies water to the nearby taps and a trough for livestock. Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya said the project will supplement other water initiatives and put an end to the perennial shortage. It will also help in farming and increase food security in the region. "This borehole will strengthen agricultural activities and offer residents water for domestic use and for their livestock," Mvurya said. Kinango residents have been relying on poor rains. They are forced to walk long distances with their livestock in search of water when the rains fail. During the dry spell, the region largely depends on relief food from donors and the county government. Majority of the children in the region are also malnourished . After devolution, the county government of Kwale embarked on sinking boreholes, constructing water pans and spearheading irrigation activities for farmers. Nyalani and Dzihoeni irrigation projects are among the many successful food security programmes that have transformed the lives of hundreds of families in Kinango. The county has now over 100 boreholes that serve locals with clean water for domestic use. Mvurya said soon the diesel-power water pump will be replaced by an electric one to reduce cost and enhance efficiency. The governor said his administration was determined to ensure residents continuously get clean drinking water in their houses. Edited by Henry Makori
