 Kilifi businesswoman-cum-politician Ruth Bendera has accused her rivals of resorting to intimidation after she was attacked by thugs at her home on Sunday morning. Bendera, who owns the Titanic Hotel and Coffee Pub in Kilifi town, was attacked early Sunday. She said the attack was meant to cow her into quitting the race for the Kilifi North parliamentary seat next year. “I had dropped a friend in Mnarani at around 5am. On returning home as I approached the gate, I met my son who was going out. I went inside and after a few minutes, I heard someone try to open the front door. I peeped through the kitchen window and saw a man in a hooded jacket holding a machete," she said. She then placed a heavy chair at the door to prevent the attacker from gaining access. But another thug sneaked in using the back door, which had not been locked. “I rushed to an underground room and the attacker shouted my name. I called officers from Kilifi police station who responded swiftly. They fired at the suspect who was trying to gain entry but he managed to escape.” Bendera said the attack has emboldened her ambition to seek the MP seat and champion women rights. Kilifi North subcounty police commander Jonathan Koech said the attack was being investigated. “Police officers responded to a call from the woman but they did not make any arrest. We have forwarded the case to the DCI who are following it up,” Koech said. Bendera said she has been receiving threats since she declared an interest in the seat. In the 2017 General Election, she vied for the Sokoni ward seat within Kilifi North but lost. She said the attackers had trailed her. “A motorbike trailed me from Titanic Hotel to Mabirikani where I had gone to talk to a boy who was depressed. I later drove from Mabirikani to Mnarani and the motorbike still trailed me. I never suspected anything all along. The motorbike made a turn as I was getting home,” she said  Edited by P.O
