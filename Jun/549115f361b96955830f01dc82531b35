A matatu driver has pleaded not guilty of causing the death of the daughter of Deputy Inspector General Edward Mbugua by dangerous driving a week ago. Patrick Macharia Magu appeared before Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Nanzushi on Thursday and also deniedÂ driving an unroadworthy motor vehicle. The prosecution alleges Mbugua knocked Meline Waithera Mbugua then sandwiched her to another vehicle, causing her death at Tom Mboya and Maragua Lane junction in Nairobi on June 17. Mbugua was allegedly driving Isuzu minibus registered as KBR 065B at a speed and manner dangerous to the public. He is also accused of driving a vehicle whose parts and equipment were not properly maintained thus making it to be a danger to the road users. The magistrate ordered the suspect be released on a bond of Sh600,000 or cash bail of Sh300,000 pending the mention of the case on July 8. On Friday last week, senior principal magistrate Esther Kimilu granted police four days to complete investigations into the death of Waithera. Officer Peter Nderingo attached to the Central police station had told the court they were awaiting the results of the postmortem and the recording of crucial prosecution witness's statements. According to the police, Wathera was crossing from Tom Mboya Street when the incident happened. Witnesses said the matatu driven by Mbugua was reversing when it crushed Waithera against another one that was stationary, badly injuring her head. She sustained injuries to her head and was rushed in an ambulance to Kenyatta National Hospital where she died.  (edited by o. owino)
