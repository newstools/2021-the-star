Tokyo Olympics trialist Jared Momanyi believes African 800m silver medalist Emmanuel Korir is destined for greatness due to his never-say-die attitude and energetic display on the track. Momanyi and Korir were part of the male quartet (Athletics Kenya A), who won the men's 4x400m relay during the past weekend's national trials for the Olympics at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. They were accompanied by Cleophas Kipruto and Kevin Kiprotich. They clocked 3:03.16 — well within the Tokyo Olympics qualification time of 3:03.80 — with Korir producing a magnificent sprint in the anchor leg. Uganda finished second in 3:07.04 whereas AK B timed 3:07.78 for third. "He had just run in the 800m final and we were not sure whether he had any more energy in his reserves to run another race. However, he assured us he was all good to go and simply asked us to give our all and then he would do his part. That was quite selfless of him and it showed in the way he sprinted off in the last lap to secure the qualification time," Momanyi said. He added that the country can excel in the relays just as it has done in the middle and long-distance races if only they are equipped with modern training equipment and hard work from the athletes themselves. "This team can do great things not only in Tokyo but in subsequent major championships. In Nigeria in 2018, we won gold in the 4x400m relay and there is no reason why the result cannot be replicated with the right preparations," he said. Earlier in the day, Korir had competed in the men's 800m where he clocked 1:46.05 to finish third behind winner Michael Saruni (1:45.81) and second-placed Ferguson Rotich (1:45.93). He is also set to represent the country in the men's 400m after he timed 44.37 at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha in 2019 to hit the Olympics qualification time of 44.90. Asked whether he will feature in both races at Tokyo, Korir said that is subject to discussion with the coaches. "That is something I am yet to decide on because it not only depends on me but the advice of the coaches as well as the programme of activities in Tokyo," said Korir. "I have always been ready for this moment because I have been working hard for quite a while with my focus on Tokyo. The last time in Nigeria I won silver (800m) and gold (4x400m relay) so I am confident I can do better."
