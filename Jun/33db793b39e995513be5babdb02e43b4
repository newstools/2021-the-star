The Kiambu government is repairing roads that have been in a pathetic state to improve farming activities. Lari Kirenga MCA Joseph Karichu on Sunday blamed poor planning and road maintenance and land encroachment for the losses farmers suffer whenever it rains. “Our people have cried a lot for many years when it rains. Stagnant water covers potholes, vehicles get stuck and no goods can be transported, meaning they cannot earn,” Karichu said. Daniel Muturi, a farmer, said that whenever it rains, they are left throwing away their milk, kales, spinach, cabbages and other vegetables they produce since lorries collecting those produce cannot access their farms. “We are a county next to Nairobi, but we have thrown away our farm produce as we cannot take them to the market; neither can vehicles access our villages when it rains because of poor roads,” he said. The most affected areas are Kinale Centre, RedRock, Ha Edward, Shilingi Ikumi, Bathi, Karia-ini, Escarpment, Githirioni and Gitithia. Speaking in Gitithia village, Karichu thanked Governor James Nyoro for his good plans to improve roads and ease transport. He urged residents to be patient as the projects get underway. “Poor planning of roads repair, failing to use enough materials, lack of proper drainage and land encroachment have resulted in poor roads,” Karichu said. Elsewhere, Kinale MCA Dominic Kiranga said local roads will be upgraded with stones during the dry season. He said the county found it important to extract stones from Escarpment and Kijabe quarries to reduce the cost of transport. Kiranga appealed to residents to trim their fences or remove them if they are on road reserves to ease expansion. From Monday to Thursday last week, county roads department officials toured all roads to be covered. Daily farmer Ruth Waceke said better roads will enable them to continue with their activities during the rainy seasons.
