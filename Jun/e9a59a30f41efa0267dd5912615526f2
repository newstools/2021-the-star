There was drama in a court on Thursday when private investigator Jane Mugo took out her two phones and started recording proceedings, including the magistrate. Mugo, who was in court for the hearing of a case in which she is charged with threatening to kill a man, continued taking photos of everyone in court when her case was mentioned. This is despite Milimani chief magistrate Martha Mutuku trying to stop her and telling her that she was an accused and she is not allowed to take videos. The accused continued taking the videos. The case was however adjourned after the prosecution said they did not have an interpreter in court. Mugo appeared in court with her lawyer Danstan Omari, ready for the hearing of the case where she is accused of threatening to kill one Deepa Shah. The prosecution counsel Anderson Gikunda however, requested for an adjournment stating that the complainant only understands Gujarat. Gikunda also said they had another hearing which would take long before they can hear another matter. The magistrate granted the application and adjourned the case to July 12. In the case, Mugo is accused of threatening to kill Shah on February 4, 2019, at Kyuna Close within Spring Valley. During plea taking in 2019, Mugo’s lawyer, Omari, had said his client was being harassed and intimidated by the police. “Your honour, this is the greatest witch-hunt by State through police. Jane has been one of their undercover operatives known to them, it is an action against one of them,” Omari said. “Your honour, we want the firearm certificate verified by Firearm Licensing Board,” said Omari. The lawyer told the court that Mugo’s tribulations emanated from a civil case number 358/2017 where the defendants were jailed by the court and his client was awarded costs. Mugo is out on a cash bail of Sh100,000.
