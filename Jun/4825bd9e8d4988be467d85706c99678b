Former Chief Justice David Maraga has said his memory of President Uhuru Kenyatta is of a head of state who has no regard for the law. "I will remember him as a president who has no regard for the law," he said. Speaking during an interview with KTN News on Wednesday, Maraga also said he agrees with his predecessor Willy Mutunga's letter to Uhuru criticising him for failing to appoint six judges. Maraga said that he and Mutunga kept quiet while the country slides into anarchy, they cannot come out later and speak, because it would be hypocritical. "I agree with every word in that statement, I've read the whole of it. When a situation get so bad, it requires that people be frank," Maraga said. The retired CJ insisted Uhuru was wrong to reject the names of the six judges, adding that the names first given to the Judicial Service Commission of appointees whose integrity was being questioned by the Executive had changed. "I confirm that the names have changed. Those who were said to have integrity issues, some have been added to that list some have been removed. For the good of persons concerned I won't name them," Maraga said. On Tuesday, Mutunga criticised Uhuru's failure to swear in six judges approved by the Judicial Service Commission. Mutunga accused Uhuru of abusing his presidential authority, terming his exercise of power as egregious, reckless and insensitive. In the letter he said that Uhuru’s conduct in the appointment of judges was “beneath the dignity of the high office” he holds as President and asked him to resign or retire. "I have elected to speak elaborately and strongly on this issue because when apparently innocuous and blithe breaches to the Constitution begin to occur, especially from the highest office in the land, they signal a dangerous dalliance with impunity," Mutunga said.
