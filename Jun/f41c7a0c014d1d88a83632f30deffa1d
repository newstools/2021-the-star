His reign may have started with mixed results but rock bottom Mathare United coach Frank Ouna believes he has seen enough in his two week-stint with the slum boys to be convinced they can beat the drop. Mathare fell to a narrow 1-0 loss to title-chasing AFC Leopards in their last outing and the closeness of that particular duel  convinced Ouna that better tidings lie ahead. "I thought we lacked aggression in the first half and almost never turned up. We were second  best in every ball. We corrected that and were the dominant side in the second half," said the once title winning assistant coach  at Gor Mahia. "We need to improve on defending our box. Blocking shots and putting bodies on the line. We conceded a cheap goal. Now we have almost two weeks break before our next match. It gives us room to work on so many things in training. Remember I have been here for less than two weeks," insisted Ouna. With a game in hand, Mathare, with eight points, are just five off the relegation safety net occupied by Nzoia United.
