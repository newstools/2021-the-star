Earnings from tea by farmers are expected to be low this year as auction prices continue to be subdued at the weekly auction, with the year entering the sixth month. After gaining slightly to $1.89 (Sh203.84 ) a kilo last week, the price dropped to $1.87(Sh201.68 ) this week as it continues to remain below the 2-dollar mark for the better part of this year. Anything below two dollars is considered not good according to auction managers–East African Tea Trade Association (EATTA). The commodity has fetched a 2-dollar overall average only once this year which came in the second week of March, when a kilo sold for an average $2 (Sh215.70). This year's lowest price so far remains $1.81(Sh195.21) which was recorded in the second week of April.  At this week's sale, the total volume traded was 295,415 kilos less than last week.  Out of 194,678 packages (12,884,000.50) kilos) available for sale, 168,759 packages (11,170,537 kilos) were sold.13.31 per cent packages remained unsold, EATTA data shows. There was however strong inquiry from Egyptian Packers with useful but selective interest from Kazakhstan and other CIS states while Sudan, Yemen, other Middle Eastern countries and UK showed useful support. "Pakistan Packers and Bazaar lent useful interest but at lower levels while Russia showed good activity with more but selective inquiry from Afghanistan. Iran were quieter with good support from Local Packers on account of price. Somalia were active at the lower end of the market," notes EATTA managing director Edward Mudibo. Kenya Tea Development Agency has also noted persistent high production and a global oversupply has pushed down the average tea prices for its 54 managed factories. The low prices so far signal low earnings for farmers, who last year were cushioned by a stronger dollar against the shillings as prices remained low. Top 10 tea exporting countries are China, India, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, Iran and Argentina. Last year, average tea auction prices fell by six per cent compared to the previous year, blamed on the high production and a depressed market occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic. 2020's full-year average price was $1.80 (Sh194.13), which was lower compared to 2019, when it fetched an average $2.05 (Sh221.09) at the auction.
