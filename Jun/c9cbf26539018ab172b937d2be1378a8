Police in Migori on Sunday arrested three suspects over the death of a 56-year-old widow at Nyasiongo village in Suna West subcounty. The body of Leonida Orimba was found in a maize plantation behind a home where chang’aa is sold. It is suspected that her death was as a result of a disagreement during the drinking spree. Her stepson Joshua Ogutu said the widow might have been killed elsewhere and dumped there. “The place where the body lay does not seem like the exact place where she was killed. Footprints show that she was killed elsewhere and her body transported to the site,” Ogutu said. “Some marks on my mother's body show that there might have been a struggle. We are calling on the police to do their investigation and establish what caused her death,” he said. Police and family members followed the trail of footprints to a blood stained house. "My mother was a drunkard and we suspect the death has something to do with  her drinking," he said. Area assistant chief Christopher Owuo said passersby found the body  laying on a footpath. “We will carry postmortem to ascertain the cause of death. The suspects will also be interrogated,” he said. The body was taken to Migori County referral hospital mortuary. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
