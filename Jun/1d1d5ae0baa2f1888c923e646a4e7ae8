Former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile will be laid to rest on June 11 at his Mbui Nzau home in Makueni County. Ndile died on Sunday morning at Nairobi Hospital after struggling with liver cirrhosis. Mavoko MP Patrick Makau announced the burial date on Wednesday after attending a funeral preparation meeting at Ndile’s other home at Greepark Estate in Machakos. Makau urged politicians to contribute wholesomely to give their colleague a befitting send off. Ndile has been eulogised as a fearless rights activist by several Makueni leaders. They described the former MP as a generous person and a strong human rights activist. Ndile was born in Western Uganda in 1964 from where he got the Kalembe nickname. He said his famous name Kalembe was a nickname picked from the Kalembe mines. "I was very young and always sickly. My other regularly took to me to the Kilembe Hospital and one of our neighbors decided to call me Kalembe due to the frequency of visits to that hospital," he said during an interview with Star in 2016. He found the name appealing and adopted it. His father had relocated in the early 1970’s to Uganda where he worked as a laborer during the construction f the Mbarara Ntugamo road. Ndile started his primary education at Kamwenge Primary school in Western Uganda and prided himself on the ability to speak at least three local dialects; Kinyankore, Kikiga and Kirutoro. In 2019, Ndile dismissed multiple death reports that surfaced online.
