African Boxing Union (ABU) middleweight champion Rayton  Okwiri has signed a lucrative five-year deal with an American-based promoter. Okwiri's deal with Florida-based Raynelo Management will earn him Sh1 million (USD10,000) for a non-title fight and at least Sh5 million (USD50,000) for a title contest. "My new contract with Raynelo is heavenly sent. It's a dream come true and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It will open the mighty doors of opportunities to bigger fights," the 2016 Rio Olympian said. The deal is a boost to the Kenya Prisons Sergeant, who is preparing for his World Boxing Organisation (WBO) title fight in Nairobi against a yet-to-be-named Russian opponent. He flew to Florida last week to prepare for a build-up fight, organised by Raynelo Management, ahead of the WBO fight. "This engagement will help to remove cobwebs. It will help me to gauge myself. You know, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I have not fought for one and a half years," he said. The WBO fight will be graced by former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, courtesy of 22Bet Kenya. Tyson will engage in an exhibition show to curtain raise for Okwiri. Kenya Professional Boxing Commission (KPBC) secretary general Franklin Imbenzi aka Kuka said KPBC and  WBO are finalising the fight plans. Better known as "Boom! Boom!",  Okwiri said he is determined to show the world that he is the same tough boxer he was during the now-defunct AIBA Pro-Boxing (APB) series. He was among the three boxers who graced the APB ranks alongside Nick Abaka and Benson Gicharu, both of who have since hung up their gloves. In the meantime, Okwiri has turned down a monthly sparring deal worth Sh500,000 with the same promoter citing personal reasons. "I'm looking at the bigger picture here and just want to concentrate a lot more on preparations for my upcoming title fight in Kenya," he said.
