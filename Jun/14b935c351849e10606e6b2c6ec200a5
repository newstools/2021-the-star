Gor Mahia left back Geoffrey Ochieng says the club's much-improved team spirit under Brazilian Manuel Vaz Pinto is the secret behind the record champions' recent resurgence. Gor's title defence had looked like a mirage in the first two months of this stop-start campaign but a run of four successive victories has brought them firmly back into title contention. "Nothing big has happened except the fact that the team spirit has risen to a new level. Everybody is fighting for each other and the results have started to come," said the defender, who has been part of K'Ogalo's last two title triumphs. Ochieng once again put in an astute performance in the champions' plucky display and eventual 1-0 win over Wazito. With almost a new-look side to work with, the left-back now is one of the veterans at the team. He has been the picture of consistency Vaz Pinto has needed from his players for the team to climb up the FKF Premier League table. "Actually, there is no secret to my performance. Just hard work, concentration on each game if given a chance to play and prayers," said the affable former Western Stima man. With several of his teammates in his time at Gor having featured for the national team Harambee Stars, Ochieng does not hide his ambitions of wearing the national colours in the not-so-distant future. "It would be a dream but first, it's hard work and God," he said. With a game in hand, Gor are seven points off the top spot, currently occupied by the team that has denied them eight consecutive title triumphs since 2013, Tusker.
