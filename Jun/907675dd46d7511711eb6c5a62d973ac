West Pokot leaders and residents have hailed the late Lutheran Bishop Samson Lokipuna for fostering education and peace in the region. Lokipuna set up schools in areas that were prone to conflicts and ensured many people in the county got education. “We are happy many senior people in this county passed through his hands,” said Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto. Moroto said that the bishop wanted the residents to know the word of God and embrace education. The leaders also hailed Bishop Lokipuna for collaborating with other churches and ensuring that peace prevailed along the volatile Pokot-Turkana border. “Many church leaders, the late being among them, scarified to see that peace prevailed along the border,” he said. “Many schools and churches started by the bishop are uncountable and we are happy he has left a legacy,” Governor John Lonyangapuo said. Lonyangapuo asked young church officials to emulate the example of Lokipuna and other early  churchmen and continue establishing schools in the region. “We still need more schools since illiteracy levels in our county are still high. Let’s support the newly established schools by taking our children to the institutions,” he said. The governor thanked the Lokipuna together with other bishops for fasting and praying seriously over peace in the entire North rift region. Lokipuna was bishop of North West diocese of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Kenya until his death. Edited by Henry Makori
