A National Intelligence Service officer was Monday charged with obtaining Sh350,000 by false pretence. Simon Wanjau Mwaura, attached to Elgeyo Marakwet, allegedly obtained Sh350,000 from Sammy Kipserem pretending that he was in a position to take his son to Australia for further studies. He was accused of committing the offence on November 23 at Transami along Airport North Road in Embakasi, Nairobi. Mwaura was also charged with being in possession of bhang and three-vehicle registration numbers—KCZ 675X, KCB 675Q and KCX 615S—suspected to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained. The charge sheet says that at around 6.30pm on June 10 on Lake View estate in Iten township, Elgeyo Marakwet, he was found with bhang valued at Sh120 which was not meant for medical use. Mwaura denied all the charges before senior resident magistrate Jane Kamau and was granted Sh300,000 bail and an alternative Sh500,000 bond. The case will be mentioned on June 29 for pretrial.
