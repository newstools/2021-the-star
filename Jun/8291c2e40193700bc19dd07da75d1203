Fresh from booking the sole African slot for the quadrennial event in Morocco, the women's national beach volleyball team will work on improving their decision-making during matches. Coach Sammy Mulinge said players have to come to grips with the aforementioned inadequacies and get their act together. "My players have not also mastered the prowess of readying opposition. If they master this skill puts them in a stronger position to respond to opposition attacks. Anticipation involves what you are likely to do in a given situation. Good decision making makes a team savour their chances," Mulinge, who doubles up as Kenya Ports Authority men's coach, observes. Mulinge says they have been watching videos of their potential opponents to gain a slight idea of what to expect. Despite the Olympic Games being a new ball game for the Kenyan queens, Mulinge is satisfied with the players' mental strength as shown during the qualifiers. "The players have the perfect mental fortitude which is a bonus. With their exploits in the game, I expect them to up the ante and be more competitive. We have videos of top teams that will be in Tokyo. I only know that Brazil, the USA and Germany will be there but the pools are yet to come out," the former APR coach said. He highlighted athletes' need to enhance their fighting spirit and use their experience as a trump card in overcoming their well-prepared opponents. The history-makers head to Mombasa to fine-tune their preparations ahead of the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony on July 23. They will then join Malkia Strikers, Hit squad, rugby sevens and athletics as the disciplines heading to Japan.
