Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji is considering turning into a state witness one of the suspects in the violent robbery of the late Kabete MP George Muchai. Thirty-two witnesses have already testified in the case and only four are waiting to give their evidence. The case has been in court for the last seven years. It has been handled by three different magistrates. On Thursday, magistrate Rosaline Ongayo called on the DPP to fast-track the negotiation process after it emerged that talks are still ongoing. Prosecution counsel Willy Momanyi told the court that allowing the case to proceed as had been scheduled would interfere with the process. He sought an adjournment to give the DPP time to settle the plea bargaining issue. The rest of the accused persons opposed the application, saying the state is delaying the conclusion of the case. They also said Momanyi did not mean well for them and that the court has been lenient with the prosecution as it always allows their applications for adjournment. But Momanyi disputed those claims, saying he needs to consult with his seniors before the plea bargain can proceed. He did not indicate how much time he needs, but the magistrate gave them 21 days. In December last year, Simon Wambugu through his lawyer Hassan Nandwa wrote to the DPP saying he was willing to testify as a prosecution witness against his co-accused persons. The DPP in response asked Nandwa to confirm whether his client was still open to plea bargaining with a view to having him testify as a prosecution witness. Nandwa in a further letter dated March 26 confirmed that he had talked to his client and was ready and willing to sign a plea bargain to the effect of him testifying as a state witness and charges withdrawn against him. In the case, Wambugu, Raphael Kimani, Stephen Lipapo, Erick Munyera, Jane Wanjiru and Margaret Njeri have been charged with violently robbing Muchai on February 7, 2015 in Nairobi.
