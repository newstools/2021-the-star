Healthcare workers, police officers and soldiers aged above 50 will be given priority in the administration of the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The government began rolling out the second jab last Friday way past the 12 weeks recommended by the World Health Organization. Some 281 people had been fully vaccinated by Tuesday. Of these, 234 are healthcare workers, 19 security officers, four people aged above 58 and 24 from the general population. Fewer than 200,000 doses are available and the healthcare workers and security personnel are deemed to have a higher risk of contracting the virus. By Monday, 969,489 people had received one jab. These included 165,513 healthcare workers, 152, 387 teachers, 82,077 security personnel, 294,245 people aged 58 years and above while 275,267 were other members of the public. About 100,000 doses were mopped up from various counties, the balance from the 1.02 million received from the Covax facility in March. Additional 72,000 doses of the Astarazeneca vaccine were received from South Sudan on Saturday. “We are starting the second vaccination with about 100,000 doses that are in the country so with those we have 172,000 to begin our second dose as we await more sharing of doses through the Covax mechanism,” vaccines deployment task force chair Dr Willis Akhwale said. Last week, the Health ministry halted the issuance of the vaccine to new recipients to use the remaining doses for the second round. Kenya is engaging other governments to ensure continuous supply and availability of doses for an uninterrupted administration of the second jab. “Of course at the same time we are putting a lot of effort to ensure that the vaccination process for those who have not received even the first jab can continue but we will appreciate that this is a global problem that everybody is experiencing,” Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said. “It is possible that the people who have not received the AstraZeneca doses might very well be receiving a new vaccine specifically Johnson and Johnson so going forward it is likely that we are going to be using multiple vaccines rather than just one vaccine.” A second consignment of 2.5 million doses from the Covax facility was expected in April but the Serum Institute of India halted exports to meet their own domestic demand.
