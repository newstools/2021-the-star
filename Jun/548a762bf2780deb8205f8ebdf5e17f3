The wife of a slain Dutch tycoon has been arrested by detectives after days of investigations. Riziki Cherono was arrested early on Thursday, regional police commander Paul Ndambuki said the Star. The body of her husband Herman Rouwenhorst, 55, was discovered at his house in early June after police responded to a distress call of a kidnapped woman near Serena Beach hotel. After rescuing her, she led detectives to her house where her husband lay dead. They found the body of Rouwenhorst lying on their bed having been murdered with his hands and legs tied using a rope, and mouth gagged. Last week, their children said in a statement that on the night of the murder, their mother had opened doors to some strangers. “Investigators have linked her to the murder, that’s why we have arrested her,” Ndambuki said. In the probe, detectives took the phones of Riziki and a caretaker for analysis. She had told police in preliminary investigations that five men had forcefully gained entry into their house with crude weapons before attacking his husband and caretaker. She is expected to be presented to court today.
