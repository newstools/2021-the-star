Tanasha Donna has unfollowed baby daddy Diamond Platnumz on Instagram through her son Naseeb Junior's account. She has also unfollowed him on her personal Instagram account, but he is still following her. This comes days after she hinted he is a deadbeat dad. Naseeb Junior is only following three people: Tanasha Donna, Hamisa Mobetto's son Dylan and Jocelina Montenegro. Tanasha has also deleted all photos her son had taken with his dad during their last trip to Tanzania. In a recent post, Tanasha wrote, "Respect to all the mothers who do it all for their kids," she said. This is not the first time Tanasha has unfollowed her baby daddy. In November last year, she took her fans by surprise after she followed Diamond Platnumz again on her son Naseeb Jnrâ€™s Instagram account.
