WRC Safari Rally enters day 2 on Friday, which saw Thierry Neuville the fastest on the Kedong stage, despite overshooting on a right-hander and dropping a handful of sections. Kedong stage near Moi South Road is expected to be the toughest stage today. The stage is synonymous with volcanic ash soil where the teams will have to be clever to navigate. Crews will today tackle two loops of three stages. Thierry Neuville took two out of three stages wins over Friday's morning loop to lead by 5.1 sec from Toyotaa'ss Kalle Rovanpera, who was fstest on the Oserian Test. Sébastien Ogier made the same mistake as Neuville but arrived at the stage finish with oil leaking from his rear damper. He will need to drive slowly in the next stage. Sebastien Ogier dropped more that 1 min 30 sec in the final stage of the morning nursing a damaged rear suspension damper. He is down in seventh. Ott Tanak is third, a further 21.1 sec. Chui Lodge (SS2/5), which covers 13.34km, has never been used before and heads into the bush and out over the plains before continuing along a twisted and heavily wooded track. Elfyn Evans became the Safari's first victim when damaged suspension on his Yaris forced him into on SS3, whilst Dani Sordo also stopped in the same stag after going off the road in his Hyundai. Local stars are expected to thrill WRC3 competition for Safari Rally's return to the FIA World Rally Championship. Karan Patel in a Ford Fiesta, Onkar Rai in a Volkswagen Polo GTI R5, and  Carl Tundo in a similar machine will be the men to watch today. Tundo claimed victory by over 12 minutes at the Equator Rally in April, which included some identical stages to those that feature on this week’s itinerary. He also shares a Safari Rally record with Shekhar Mehta, having won the event five times— albeit not as part of the WRC.
