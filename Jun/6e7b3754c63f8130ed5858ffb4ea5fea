Nyayo Stadium will host the Barthes Cup between for June 24 and July 3. Defending champions and hosts Kenya will face off with powerhouses Namibia, Senegal and Madagascar for the sole ticket to the Junior World Rugby Trophy competition slated for next year. Kenya hosted the 2019 edition at the KCB Sports Club in Ruaraka, beating Namibia  21-18 in the final to qualify for the Junior Rugby World trophy  in Brazil the same year, where they finished sixth overall under former coach Paul Odera. Speaking on Sunday, coach Curtis Olago, who has taken charge of the team, said the squad have had two training camps in Nakuru, beating Menengai Oilers 24-22 in one of the build-up matches and drawing the other. “The lads are tough and playing with a lot of determination, showing a lot of promise and getting better with each match,” said Olago. Olago said they will have two build-up matches against champions KCB and Impala in a fortnight. He said it's race against time for the team to be fit and mentally ready following the suspension of sports in the country in March, just as the team started training. “It's not been easy but we soldier on. The suspension of sports affected us but we have to move on,” added Olago. The KCB tactician said playing at home will be a big boost to the side's chances. “It will be an advantage but we have to do the basics right. We have two and half weeks to finalise our preparations,” said Olago Olago noted playing against club sides will harden the young charges ahead of the tournament.
