Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has asked Education CS George Magoha to declare how much capitation each school benefited from in 2019-20 and 2020-21. He said some schools don't seem to be benefiting from the funds and if they are, then it's a drop in the ocean. The lawmaker said secondary schools in Vihiga have been receiving less capitation funds despite a high student population. Osotsi told the Star he wants to know when the government was going to process the capitation arrears for affected schools in Vihiga county. “Admission is just about to take place and schools should be ready to receive learners. They can’t be ready if there is no capitation,” he said. Candidates who sat the 2020 KCPE exams will report to secondary schools on August 2. This gives parents at least one and a half months to prepare. This will be the third group under the 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary policy. “The admission is likely to push the school population to 3.1 million students in secondary schools from the current 2.8 million,” Osotsi said. Magoha said the government has allocated Sh4.2 billion for infrastructure development in public primary and secondary schools. “These funds will be used to ease the strain on school facilities due to the increased enrolment,” Magoha said during Form 1 selection. He said they will work with the Interior ministry to ensure all candidates who sat the 2020 KCPE exams join secondary schools. “Right from the first day of reporting, our ministry officials will be required to file accurate daily returns on the status of reporting to schools,” the CS said. Magoha warned principals against turning away students due to lack of fees. He, however, asked parents to pay school fees. “Parents are therefore advised to only pay the fees set by the ministry and report incidents of any students turned away for not paying higher fees to the nearest education office for action,” Magoha said.
