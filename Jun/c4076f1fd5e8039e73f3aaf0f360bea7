Malkia Strikers are back to the drawing after seeing their plans to train in Brazil and Kurume City, Japan go up in smoke due to the coronavirus pandemic. The national was set to tour Brazil last month for a series of friendly matches against local teams while Olympics Kenya has anticipated having Team Kenya train in Kurume in a pre-Games camp, both of which fell through. However, coach Paul Bitok is not losing hope. The experienced coach has now proposed to have the play European powerhouse, The Netherlands Olympics-bound Argentina and in friendly matches. Bitok said they will be happy to play Argentina — who are in Pool 'B' alongside China, United States, Russia, Italy and Turkey — since they will provide a platform in gauging the team's readiness for the quadrennial Games. Argentina are ranked 17th on the FIVB World rankings, six positions above Kenya. The Netherlands are 10th despite missing out on Tokyo. "Plan 'A' and 'B' are as good as over but we hope Plan 'C' becomes successful. We are negotiating with The Netherlands and Argentina. Argentina are willing provided another team comes in. Travelling to The Netherlands could be a good option since they have managed to control the pandemic," observed Bitok. "Argentina are in another group in the Olympics draw and I will be excited to play them. If we can play both teams, we can sort out our weakness before connecting to Tokyo.  With the help of the Brazillian coaches, we will be good to face our opponents in Tokyo." Bitok said it was unfortunate to see Kurume City withdraw from their  2019 deal with Nock to host Team Kenya, adding that they had already organised friendly matches against Fukuoka-based teams. "The news was unexpected. Plans were underway to play three teams in Kurume. The city is not far from the venue of the competition. Playing just next to the venue would have lifted the mood of the players," added Bitok.
