Wang'uru stadium in Kirinyaga will be ready in two months. County commissioner Jim Njoka announced Wednesday that the facility in Mwea town is 82 per cent done. Construction began in August 2020 after President Uhuru Kenyatta's visit to the county in February that same year. Uhuru, who found the facility in pathetic condition, promised to have it upgraded. "The contractor has assured us that the work will be completed by August 18, 2021," Njoka said. Upon its completion, the commissioner said, the Sh300 million facility is expected to boost the economy of Mwea town and ultimately the entire county by hosting national, regional and sporting events. It will also help in tapping and nurturing local talent, he added. The administrator spoke at the stadium during an inspection of national government projects. He also checked the progress of the construction of a 65km road that will cut through Mutithi, Kadongu, Kagio and Ngurabani towns. Njoka urged residents to maintain the road by redirecting the outflow of water from rice canals away from it. "The national irrigation authority in collaboration with road maintenance agencies should always ensure that there is proper drainage and that water from the farms do not flow onto the road," he said. "Otherwise, if not selfishly guarded, the project will not help us as it will dilapidate in the first two years of use. And that will boil down to wasting government's funds" Earlier, Njoka led the county inspection committee in supervising Thiba dam, which is 56 per cent complete. The Sh8.2 billion dam being put up on 500 acres will be a game changer in rice farming. It will enable introduction of a second cropping season and double rice production from 125,000 tonnes. The dam will provide sufficient irrigation water for an additional 10,000 acres under the Mwea rice scheme expansion programme. The dam, whose construction began in August 2018, is expected to be complete by December 1. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
