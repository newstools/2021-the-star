Zambian star Jay Rox has teamed up with Tanzanian singer Juma Jux and Kenz Ville Marley to release Changanya. Changanya is a classic Zed beats/Bongo flava infused record produced by Kenz & Beingz, the dynamic duo responsible for Jay Rox’s Distance remix featuring Rayvanny & AY. Speaking about the song, Jay says, “Plus I love his sound. Jux and I have got several things in common. "Apart from being a musician, he is also business-minded; he's got his clothing line African boy and I also have a clothing line and sneaker brand that I'm pushing down here.” Jux has been in the industry for quite a while now and has bagged several awards among them, Best R&B song at Kili Music Awards (Tanzania). The year 2020 saw him orchestrate one of Tanzania’s biggest albums The Love Album.
