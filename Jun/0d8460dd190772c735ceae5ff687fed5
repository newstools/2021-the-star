Award-winning group Sauti Sol have signed an ambassadorial deal with Infinix. The deal was unveiled at a press conference on Wednesday at the Social House. In a statement, the group said they chose to work with them as they are a strong sponsor of the African creative industry and have been a great supporter of the Kenyan music industry. Their business model is collaborative, inclusive and strongly hedged on innovation, they said. They wanted to co-create a campaign whose pillars capture the essence of both businesses, more so a campaign that is transformative, they added. "This rang true to us, and we are glad to not only work with them but with their vast network of affiliate businesses, which range from music technology solutions, fitness and lifestyle technology and app development solution," Sauti Sol said. The company's manager, Mike Zhang, said they chose the Kenyan Afro-pop band as they are not only the best fit but the natural choice for the path they as a youth-centred brand aim to pursue. "They are the very embodiment of why young people should make their own way through life regardless of the challenges they face along the way," he said. The group will be launching this new product in Mombasa mid this month. On their official social media handles, Sauti Sol wrote, "We're stoked to be the newest addition to Infinix family and their first official brand ambassadors."
