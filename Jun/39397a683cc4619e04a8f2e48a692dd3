Safaricom is set to launch the M-Pesa Super App with Mini Apps, to usher in a new way to experience money. The launch will take place on Wednesday, June 23, in which the public can be part of the launch via YouTube on the Safaricom official channel. The Mini Apps enable customers and Lipa Na M-Pesa Businesses to Shop, Interact with Suppliers and accomplish hundreds of tasks within the M-Pesa Super App. In attendance will be Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa and M-Pesa Africa CEO Sitoyo Lopokoiyit. In March 2007, Safaricom launched M-Pesa, an innovative payment service for the unbanked. M-Pesa services operate in Tanzania, Mozambique, DRC, Lesotho, Ghana, Egypt, Afghanistan and South Africa. In June 2020, Safaricom launched the Lipa Na M-Pesa Business smartphone app for the more than 170,000 merchants on the service. Named “M-Pesa for Business“, it will empower business owners to access real-time statements, export statements, and track their business performance on the go. Through the app, business owners can further withdraw funds from Lipa Na M-Pesa to their M-Pesa accounts, bank accounts or at an agent.
