A man who ordered chips worth Sh25 bob in Kawangware and went missing has been charged with obtaining credit contrary to the law. Enock Mwangani was charged on Friday before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki where he pleaded guilty to all charges. He was also charged with assaulting the chips vendor, injuring his eyes and threatening to kill him. The offences were committed on May 29 at Kawangware Gatina area in Dagoretti. The complainant, Mulinge Nyamai was at the kiosk where he works as a waiter when the accused person came. “He ordered for some smokies and chips, he paid for the smokies and left without paying for the chips or giving any explanation,” prosecutor James Kamande said. He said the smokies and chips were to cost Sh55 but the accused person just managed to raise Sh30 bob. The court heard that on the second day when the complainant asked for the balance, the accused person told him off, he said he will won't pay and assaulted him. He allegedly told him that he will kill him if he dared to come near him. The accused in his defense told Mwaniki that the complainant was in a relationship with someone's girlfriend who was shocked upon hearing him call her 'beb'. “The man was angered and assaulted him,” he said. He told the court that his wife had just delivered and pleaded for leniency. The magistrate directed that the matter be mentioned on June 17 and a probation report be filed. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
