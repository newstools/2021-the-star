In line with its mandate to keep the Kenyan skies safe and secure, the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority has released procedures to control air traffic during the WRC Safari Rally scheduled to take place this weekend in Naivasha. The procedures have been developed in coordination with the rally organisers. KCAA director general Capt. Gilbert Kibe said the aviation regulator has also assembled a dedicated team of air traffic control officers to provide air traffic services and weather information. He said this will guide rally team helicopters, coordinate VIP movement as well as provide alerting services to aircraft that will be engaged in the rally that was officially flagged off by the President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday. “In addition, the team will also be responsible for the coordination of medical evacuation flights and ensuring expeditious facilitation of aircraft in distress, in case of any eventuality. KCAA has a dedicated Air Traffic Control - Flight Information Service Desk at the WRC Safari Rally service park manned by two Air Traffic Controllers and a team leader. We have also released procedures which are subject to change depending on prevailing conditions and they remain in force till Sunday June 27,” said Kibe. The over 20 registered aircraft will mainly be engaged in ferrying VIPs, journalists covering the rally and medical evacuation teams among others. “Members of the public are urged to keep a safe distance from aircraft that are taking off or landing during this period,” he added. -Edited by SKanyara
