A man who allegedly forged burial permits of two people with intent to defraud Sh200,000 was Thursday charged before a Nairobi court. The charged sheet says Victor Ojiambo and others not in court with intent to defraud, forged a burial permit dated March 10, 2020 in the names of Beatrice Awino Oloo purporting it to be genuine and issued by the assistant chief, Ojibo sub-location in Busia county. He allegedly committed the offence on or before March 10, 2020 at an unknown place. Ojiambo was also charged with forging a burial permit under the names of Michael Willys Ojimbo purporting it to be genuine and issued by the assistant chief. He was further charged with fraudulently uttering Ojimboâ€™s burial permit on August 6, 2020 at Lompasago Cooperative Savings and Credit Society office. The court heard Ojiambo also forged a permit for burial of Beatrice Auma on November 28, 2020 at an unknown place. He also used tricks to induce Lompasago Sacco to pay Sh200,000 to him by pretending that he was the beneficiary of Fariji Last Expense benefit claims for Beatrice and Willy and that both had died. He allegedly committed the offence between May 5 and August 20, 2020. The accused denied the charges before Milimani senior resident Jane Kamau and requested for witness statements from the prosecution. He was released on a cash bail of Sh300,000 or a bond of Sh500,000. The case will be mentioned on June 29. Edited by Henry Makori
