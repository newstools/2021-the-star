All livestock auction markets in Kisumu county have been suspended indefinitely as Covid-19 cases continue to rise. County Health executive Boaz Nyunya said on Thursday evening in a statement that the Covid 19 multi-agency team will ensure the directive is enforced. “We wish to assure the people of Kisumu and other stakeholders of our resolve to battle this wild and merciless pandemic that has continued to ravage the world.” Nyunya said Bar Korwa open air market in Seme subcounty has been closed indefinitely for failing to provide sanitary services. He said more markets across the county are on their radar. “Management committees of markets have been instructed to ensure there is water and sanitiser at the entrances of all the markets,” the official said. Management committee members are required to appoint market champions to educate traders on the Covid-19 protocols, Nyunya said. “We wish to appeal to our people to take the lead in the fight against Covid-19. Let’s obey the laid down protocols. Let’s keep social distance and avoid crowded places,” he said. Kisumu has so far registered 5,994 Covid-19 cases from 43,000 tests.
