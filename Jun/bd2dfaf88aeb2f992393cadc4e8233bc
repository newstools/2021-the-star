Kenya's Malkia Strikers' 12-member squad to fly the country’s flag at the Tokyo Olympic Games in Japan next month has been unveiled. The biggest casualties are opposite hitter Violet Makuto and libero Elizabeth Wanyama. However, the two will continue training with the team until July 5th before the Kenya contingent departs the following day. However, the technical bench has warned that there is still no guarantee that the retained players if they do not keep up with the pace at the camp. “They must work hard to maintain their positions ahead of the July 5th deadline of presenting the 12 names to the Federation of International Volleyball (FIVB),” said one of the officials. Experienced left-attacker and captain Mercy Moim will lead the team. The Kenya Commercial Bank player will be hoping to improve on their 11th position posted at both the Sydney 2000 and 2004 Athens Olympic Games. The selectors have also opted for experience over youth after last week's axing of 18-year old Immaculate Nekesa and Kenya Pipeline's Pamela Adhiambo. Kenya is spoilt for choice and the decision was based purely on merit, according to the officials. The next phase of training will be in Kurume City before proceeding to Tokyo for the event proper. Squad: Left attackers: Mercy Moim, Noel Murambi, Pamela Jepkirui, Leonida Kasaya; Middle blockers: Edith Mukuvilani, Lorine Chebet, Gladys Ekaru; Opposite: Sharon Chepchumba, Emmaculate Chemtai; Setters: Jane Wacu, Joy Lusenaka; Libero: Agripna Kundu.
