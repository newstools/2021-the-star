The fight against crime has received a boost following a donation of 18 motorbikes to the DCI from the Federal Republic of Germany. The donation includes top-of-the-range BMW 1250CC bikes which were handed over by the German Ambassador to Kenya H.E Annette Guenther, in a ceremony held at DCI headquarters on Tuesday. Ambassador Guenther lauded the cooperation between Kenya and German's investigative agencies, adding that the over Sh14.5 million worth of motorcycles would complement other DCI means of transport. During the ceremony, DCI boss George Kinoti acknowledged the support that DCI has received from the German embassy, adding that the donation would go far in boosting the Directorateâ€™s effectiveness in responding to crime. Also present during the ceremony were BKA Police liaison officers; Stefan Koch, Harald Gessner, and Rene Becker. The donation comes three months after the German government donated forensic laboratory equipment valued at Sh26 million to DCI to enhance investigations. The donation included equipment which includes cameras and simulation crime scene tools at the DCI headquarters. ICT CS Joe Mucheru had said that the donation was part of larger help from the German government which has among others seen major training institutions fitted with simulation rooms to help police with their training to manage crime scenes. Kinoti had also said the donation will help them solve many pending cases, adding that the construction was 98 per cent complete and its inauguration will be in weeks. This means the laboratory will be put into use to solve many unsolved cases including murder, robbery with violence, rape, and housebreaking among others.
