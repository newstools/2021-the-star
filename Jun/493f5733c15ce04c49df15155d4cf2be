Education Cabinet Secretary Prof. George Magoha has banned the use of school compounds and facilities for unauthorised meetings. In a statement on Saturday, the CS said the meetings are exposing learners to the dangers of Covid-19, because most of those in attendance do not comply with guidelines from the Ministry of Health, in combating the disease. Magoha insisted that stern action will be taken against any person or groups that will be found going against the directive. "The Ministry is, therefore, notifying all Kenyans that school compounds and facilities are out of bounds and cannot be used to host unauthorised meetings," Magoha said. He called on the public to allow learners continue with their education uninterrupted and without exposing them to the Covid-19 disease. In January, Magoha banned the use of portable sanitisers by students in schools. The CS raised a red flag over malicious use of the product to cause arson in learning institutions. This was after an inferno razed part of a dormitory at Cheborge Boys Secondary School in Kericho. "A fire was started using a sanitiser in one of the schoolsâ€¦ I want to tell teachers that they must not allow small-bottle sanitisers into schools the portable sanitisers, with students should be taken and returned when the child is leaving school," Magoha said.
