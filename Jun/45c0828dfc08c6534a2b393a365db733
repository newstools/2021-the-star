Police are looking for a woman accused of obtaining money by false pretences in Thika. Beatrice Gathoni Boro is wanted by DCI Thika West after she jumped bail. The accused was arraigned at Thika Law Courts in 2017 and charged with defrauding a victim over Sh15 million in a food supply deal to a refugee camp in Kenya. After plea taking, she was released on a Sh 1million bond but later absconded. “A warrant of arrest has since been issued,” DCI director George Kinoti said. Kinoti said anyone with information that may assist in her arrest, should contact the DCI through toll-free line 0800722203. Two weeks ago, police were looking for a man who posed as a staff member in Defence Ministry and obtained over Sh26 million by false pretence. David  Kahi Ambuku alias General is wanted by detectives following a warrant of arrest issued against him by Milimani Law Courts in Criminal Case No. 694/2018. DCI boss George Kinoti says that the fugitive is wanted for obtaining over Sh26 million by false pretences in a fake tender scheme.
