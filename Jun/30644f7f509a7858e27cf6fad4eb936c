Vera Sidika says she had a terrible experience dating Tanzanian doctor Jimmy Chansa. In her Insta stories, Vera said the relationship was unbearable and it took a lot of endurance. A fan asked Vera Sidika to reveal the truth about what happened between her and Chansa. She replied, "One of the most unfortunately traumatic experiences I have ever had amongst all my relationships. Never judge a book by its cover and sometimes the devil you know is better than the angel you don't know," she said. "End up? It wouldn't even have reached seven months if I wanted it to. Ata hizo five months I tried So So hard, it was terrible. Honestly, I am happy I didn't continue doing that to myself." Weeks ago, Jimmy Chansa said the relationship was "good as it lasted".
