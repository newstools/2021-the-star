 Public health officials and police in Kisumu have heightened crackdowns on violators of Covid-19 protocols amid a worrying increase in cases. On Saturday, 12 people including six police officers were arrested for contravening curfew protocols. They were nabbed at around 8pm within Black Perl bar in Nyamasaria. The county government has expressed concerns that residents were still flouting the safety protocols. Cases of new infections and deaths are surging. On Saturday, the county recorded 142 new cases. Health executive Boaz Nyunya said Kisumu Central subcounty has so far recorded 3,785 which accounts for 63 per cent of the infections since the pandemic struck last year. There have been 707 cases in Kisumu East, Kisumu West (503), Nyando (322), Nyakach (162), Seme (137) and Muhoroni (130). The attack rate in Kisumu is at 594 per 100,000 people with a weekly positivity rate of 23.23 per cent. That is more than double the national average of 10 per cent. "We have recorded 169 deaths to date and tested a total of 46, 757 people. Out of the 599 persons tested for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, 142 tested positive," Nyunya said on Saturday. He added, "We have 856 active cases. Out of these, 151 are in hospitals while 705 are under home-based isolation. The majority of cases in Kisumu county are aged between 30 and 39 years, with 56 per cent being males." Nyunya said some residents were still boarding overloaded matatus. They also don't properly wear their face masks. “It has come to our attention that barely a day after the national government issued additional containment measures through the Ministry of Health, some residents continue to flout these protocols,” he said. Nyunya said in bars and restaurants, some people still do not keep their distance from one another while others hide along the corridors to continue drinking after the closing time of 7pm. “We wish to caution that the crackdown by the county multi-agency team will spare no one, save for those performing essential services duties,” he said.
