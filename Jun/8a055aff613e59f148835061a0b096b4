Speaking about the pregnancy journey, the mum-to-be said she has had the most beautiful stress-free pregnancy. "No morning sickness, no symptoms. God is good. I cook, eat everything, can jump, run, maybe even somersault," she said. "Not even a slight headache or nausea. The only symptom I had is a missed period." Brown Mauzo said Vera is his great love story. "You are my big break and I am happy and super proud to walk with you on this journey."
