Former Tokyo Marathon champion Helah Kiprop is among the elite athletes enlisted for the third edition of the Eldoret City Marathon set for this Sunday in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County. With defending champion and Barcelona marathon champion out of the race, Kiprop will be for a share of the Sh3.5m prize kitty alongside 400 others. Despite numerous requests, race director Moses Tanui maintained they could not extend the June 2 registration deadline, adding that issuance of bib numbers has already begun. The two-time Boston marathon champion said that the race has gone international and all international standards will be following to the latter to secure a smooth running and get the exact number of athletes competing in the third edition of the race that was rescheduled. “As organisers, we had to stick to our laid down rules in both registration and bib number collections,” said Tanui, adding that no bibs will be issued on race day. The race was initially set for April 11 but was rescheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and Tanui said they are excited to have the event back on track. “We want to tell everyone that there will be no registration or bib collection on the material day. Anybody who will not have collected his/her bib numbers on time will not compete,” warned Tanui. The race will start at Sogomo near the University of Eldoret, traverse the streets of Eldoret before finishing at Zion Mall in the Central Business District. The race will also see the crowds normally witnessed at the finishing line reduced as one way of preventing the spread of coronavirus with fans urged to follow the race on television and social media pages.
