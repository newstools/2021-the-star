Featherweight boxer Beatrice Akoth has backed her compatriots Elizabeth Akinyi (welterweight) and diminutive Christine Ongare to do well when they finally get to the ring for the medal hunt in the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Akoth, who trains at the Eddy Papa Musi Gym in Kariobangi, cited the length the two fighters have been in camp and the coaches handling the team as a reason for her optimism. "For a boxer, it's important to have a right training atmosphere and Eliza and 'Mammy' Ongare have had that since last year. They are in very good hands in terms of coaches and I believe they will surprise many people in Tokyo," Akoth, who was part of the national boxing team squad that took part in the African Olympic qualifiers in Dakar, said. "It was a good experience for me in my first international assignment. I hope to have another opportunity to fight for Kenya. That is why even though we have no scheduled fights on the horizon, I am working hard in training every single day,"  Akoth,a relative late bloomer in the sport, said. Under the guidance of   head coach Benjamin Musa and David Munuhe, the Japan- bound fighters Akinyi, Ongare, team captain Nick Okoth and heavyweight Elly Ajowi have been hard at work in camp. The squad returned from an invitational tournament in Russia, which was part of the build-up for the  Games.
