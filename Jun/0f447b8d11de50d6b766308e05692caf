President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday visited the family of the late businessman and Capital Group Limited Chairman, Chris Kirubi, ahead of his funeral service and burial on Saturday. A statement from State House said Uhuru condoled with the departed businessman’s family at his Nairobi home. The funeral service will be held on Friday at the Faith Evangelistic Ministry (FEM) church in Karen. Kirubi’s burial is set for Saturday June 19, 2021 at his farm in Thika. The Head of State had earlier in the week mourned Kirubi as a seasoned businessman, entrepreneur and industrialist who founded and successfully ran some of Kenya's largest corporations. He added that Kirubi was a successful mentor and coach who helped raise a generation of entrepreneurs and corporate leaders in Kenya. "The cruel hand of death has robbed our nation of a patriot whose entrepreneurial spirit, hard work and determination saw him create some of our country's largest enterprises which offer employment to thousands of our people," Uhuru said. Kirubi died on Monday June 14, 2021 at his home after a long battle with cancer. The businessman died aged 80 and has left behind two children. “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Dr. Christopher J. Kirubi who passed away today at 1 pm at his home after a long battle with cancer fought with fortitude, grace and courage. He was surrounded by his family," his family said in a statement.
