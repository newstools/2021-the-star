Judge Peter Cahill has sentenced Derek Chauvin to over 22 years in prison. The former officer has been held in solitary confinement since he was found guilty in April. Chauvin's lawyers asked for leniency - including no additional jail time. Prosecutors had asked that he serve 30 years in prison. In April he was found guilty on three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter. Speaking to the court for the first time before his sentencing, Chauvin said that: "Due to some additional legal matters at hand, I’m not able to give a full formal statement at this time," Derek Chauvin says. "Very briefly though, I do want to give my condolences to the Floyd family. "There's going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest - and I hope things will give you some peace of mind - thank you," he concludes.
