Performance management in the public sector continues to be one of the government’s strategies for enhancing efficient services. Its implementation is expected to improve the quality of service rendered. The performance of the public sector is paramount because it defines and indeed forms the glass ceiling for the performance of other sectors of the economy. The public sector will deliver and exceed targeted results if all ministries, counties, department and agencies embrace performance management and entrench a performance-oriented culture. Ministries, state corporations, tertiary institutions, several county governments and one independent constitutional commission (Teachers Service Commission) have implemented performance contracts as a means of enhancing accountability and service delivery. The uptake and effective implementation by MCDAs should therefore not be optional. Performance contracting,  as a medium of impelling implementation of public policies, projects and programmes, aims at sustaining improvement in the performance of MCDAs. The results of the annual performance evaluation have demonstrated the need to embrace and sustain best practices that lead to the achievement of targeted results with a clear focus on the beneficiaries—Kenyans. The implementation of performance contracts for the financial year 2019-20 and the achievement of the targets thereof was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The budget cuts to mitigate the pandemic and introduction of austerity measures further affected the achievement of performance targets. The above notwithstanding, ministries, counties, department and agencies have continued to deploy performance contracting as one of the performance management tools in achieving their annual performance targets and ultimately their respective mandates.
