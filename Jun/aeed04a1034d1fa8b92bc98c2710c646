KCAA has denied claims that there was an aircraft that purportedly went missing in Machakos county on Monday night. Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko had posted on his social media about the missing aircraft. He said that the domestic aircraft reportedly lost communication with the tower and went missing from the radar for sometime due to "negligence" by air traffic controllers. However, KCAA communications officer Mercy Mbaka asked members of the public not to panic and "ignore the fake news:. “KCAA would like to clarify that no such incident occurred. We are in contact with all air operators in the country and none has reported such an incident,” Mbaka said. “We wish to assure all our stakeholders that KCAA is fully in control of our airspace through our Air Traffic Controllers and all air navigation facilities are up to date and functioning well,” she added. Sonko went ahead to ask the aviation industry to stop gambling with Kenyans' lives. “Next time hii mchezo ikifanyika tena tutawaanika hadharani one by one you know yourselves. Ukiwa na hangover chukua off,” he said. This loosely translates to "If this mistake happens again, we will publicly shame you....If you have hangovers, take days off".
