Songstress Nadia Mukami has cleared the air on charging $100,000 (Sh10 million) for a collabo. When Bahati released the 'Fikra za Bahati' song, he asked for a music collabo with Nadia Mukami. The pop star then told him she will charge $100,000 for it. During the 'Love like this' album launch, Nadia said the comment was a joke that should not be taken seriously. "People blew it out of context. I forgot to put emojis so they took me seriously. I am open to any collabo. If someone is talented, they can speak to my management," she said. Besides music, Nadia is a member of the 7s Creative Group of female entrepreneurs. They deal in businesses such as bulk SMS, managing artistes' photography and other art-related businesses. She is currently working on a music album.
