Police are hunting for a motorcycle gang that fatally shot a woman in the chest and grabbed her handbag as she was closing shop. The attack occurred on Monday night in Greenspan, Donholm. People were rushing home to beat the curfew. Emma Achieng, wife of Luo Benga Maestro John Ochieng, popularly known as Madanji Perimeter, was heading home after closing shop when the gang shot her in the chest and rode off with her bag. Witnesses said the gang had trailed the woman before striking. The attack was the latest in a series recently witnessed. Nairobi police boss Augustine Nthumbi said they have intensified operations. Last weekend, a shopkeeper was shot during a robbery in Nairobi's Mukuru slums. A gang of about five men had been roaming the area, robbing pedestrians when they bumped into Dennison Mutunga, 40. They shot him at close range in the chest as they grabbed an undisclosed amount of money from his shop. Police and witnesses said Mutunga was closing his general merchandise shop when the gang struck. After a brief confrontation, they shot him and shot Ronald Ombomba who was walking past. On June 2, Phelidah Moraa, 41, was shot dead as she resisted a robbery in Nairobiâ€™s Pipeline area at 9pm. The gang grabbed her bag. Efforts to trace the gang are underway. Police suspect the gang had been monitoring the victims' movements while hanging around before they struck. (Edited by V. Graham)
