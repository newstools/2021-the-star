There was a chaotic scene around Afya Centre in Nairobi on Wednesday over a struggle between a city hawker and the County Council officers. The hawker identified as Veronica Gaturu, made loud wails along Gedi Street after the County officers confiscated her goods in a long and dramatic struggle. The woman who operates along Moi Avenue was caught hawking along the footpaths, a forbidden activity by the City Council management service. The officers didn't hesitate to grab her items prompting the woman to fight back. The woman hold onto the moving county officers' van attracting a huge crowd that stopped the vehicle. The officers were forced to return the goods back to the woman. Gaturu among many other hawkers expressed their frustrations claiming they are being mistreated by the 'Kanjos' despite their efforts of trying to make ends meet during the hard economic hardship occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic.
