At least 28 per cent of Kenyans who took their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine have received their second dose. Data from the ministry shows that as at Monday, 289,800 people had received their second jab, with the largest percentage being male at 56 per cent. That data shows that 68,688 healthcare workers have taken their second dose while the number of teachers stands at 36,167. The number of security officers who have received their second dose is 21,781, 84,855 are people aged above 58 years while 78,309 are members of the public. According to the Health CS Mutahi Kagwe, 1,003,204 Kenyans have received their first dose of the vaccine. “As at today (Monday) a total of 1,292,004vacicnes have so far been administered across the country. Proportion on adults fully vaccinated is 1.11 per cent,” Kagwe said. The ministry halted further administration of the first doses and launched the issuance of the second dose last month after the lapse of the 12 weeks waiting period as stipulated by the World Health Organisation. This comes even as 287 more people tested positive for the Covid-19 from a sample size of 2,699 tested in 24 hours, representing a positivity rate of 10.6 per cent. The CS confirmed that 152 patients had recovered from the disease; 84 from the home based care programme and 68 from various health facilities countrywide, bringing the number of recoveries in the country to 124,588. “Unfortunately, 17 patients have succumbed to the disease, all of them late deaths reported after conducting facility record audits on diverse dates in the months of April, May and June,” Kagwe said in a statement. This raises the cumulative deaths to 3,612. As at Monday, 1,062 patients were admitted in various health facilities while 6,730 were under the home based care isolation. One hundred and one patients were in the intensive care unit, 33 of whom are on ventilator support, 45 on oxygen and 23 under observation. Another 116 patients were separately on supplemental oxygen with 102 in the general wards and 14 in the high dependency unit.
