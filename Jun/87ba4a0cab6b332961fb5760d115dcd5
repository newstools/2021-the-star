Party politics are presented as an immutable set of ideals that are incompatible with opposing values. Anything less than absolute loyalty is a betrayal. However, agreeing with the party leadership on every issue is unlikely but at the same time resisting is taken as a total betrayal. There is no such thing as middle ground in political parties, this eliminates the freedom to have dissenting ideals and still be a loyal party member. It's either you align with a party or you are on the fence and when you are on the fence, you have no opinion. Centralisation is seen as a symptom of an uncaring or uneducated mindset, left to those who donâ€™t have the political maturity to pick a side. Mature people in politics have a stand and take sides. Lack of decision is considered political hypocrisy. Of late, we have seen mass movements from one political affiliation to the other, and as many of us ululate on the same, it remains a wonder if it shows political maturity. Party loyalty is like love. You are with who or what you love because there is what you believe in the affair and it is difficult to cut the tie. Once you wake up early morning and walk out of a union so easily that means there was nothing binding. Recent movements show politicians who have nothing to lose where they are leaving and so nothing to add to where they are moving to. In politics, just like an investment, you feel when you walk away and so you better pump all efforts to make it better for more fortunes. Therefore, there should be no cries for those who walk away. It's on this strength that the diehards of President Uhuru Kenyatta, his party and its affiliations continue to stand with him towards his final office term. A loyal person corrects from within.
