DCI detectives are in pursuit of an 18-year old man suspected of killing his father in Londiani , Kericho County. The teenager is suspected of fatally beating his father on Sunday after an argument over lost chickens. The Directorate of Criminal Investigation in a statement via Twitter on Monday said the suspect confronted his 50-year-old father Wilson Kipsoi, over the whereabouts of six of his chickens, that he suspected his father had sold. "Angered by the confrontation, Kipsoi threatened to shoot his son with arrows, forcing the form four student at Kapcheplanga day Secondary school, to flee and seek refuge at a neighbour’s house," the DCI said. According to the Directorate, the suspect went back home the following day armed with a club, vowing to stop at nothing until his father produced his chickens. "He descended on him and assaulted him repeatedly using the crude weapon, while demanding compensation for his missing chickens," the DCI said. Immediately after the incident, the suspect allegedly went into hiding leaving his father unconscious. The injured man was rushed to Londiani Sub-County Hospital, where he succumbed while undergoing treatment. The DCI said the suspect is still at large and being hunted down by detectives.
