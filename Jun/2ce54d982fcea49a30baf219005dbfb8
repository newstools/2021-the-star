Two people were shot dead by cattle rustlers on Sunday afternoon in Songa, Saku constituency, in Marsabit county. Marsabit county commissioner Paul Rotich said a 12-year-old student and a herdsman, 28, were killed during the raid. The raiders drove away 192 heads of cattle, the administrator said. He said the attackers shot and killed four animals. The animals may have been caught by stray bullets aimed at the victims, he said. Rotich said security officers were dispatched to the area immediately after the attack and are pursuing the raiders. Residents are helping security personnel track down the attackers, he added. Rotich warned that cattle rustlers would be dealt with decisively. The incident took place hours after Eastern regional commissioner Isaiah Nakoru left Marsabit after a three-day security meeting with local government security agents, chiefs and assistant chiefs.
