Police in Kisumu gunned down one person as 14 others escaped after robbing houses in Dansol area,  Nyamasaria. The  robbery incident was reported at 2.30am on Saturday via OB NO. 4/12/6/2021 by one of the tenants at Dansol house four kilometres north of the station. According to Kisumu county commander Samuel Anampiu, one tenant who resides at Dansol area said they had a bang and  a group of 15 people broke into their house, beat them up and made away with household valuables. Anampiu said the thugs broke into four other houses within the same block and later disappeared into the darkness towards Manyatta through Ouko bridge. "Fortunately enough our officers (from Kassagam and Nyamasaria) confronted them at the bridge where they attempted to attack the officers with the crude weapons they were having," he said. He said the officers responded swiftly by firing, fatally injuring one as others scampered in different directions. The county commander said the officers recovered four televisions, two sound systems, one microwave, two gas cylinders and a laptop amongst other items. "Also besides the suspect's body, police officers recovered one metal bar suspected to be used for door breaking and a kitchen knife", he said. The county commander added that all the items recovered were positively identified  by the owners at the scene. The body of the suspect was moved to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral morgue.
