The body of former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has arrived in his Gem home ahead of interment later on Saturday. Midiwo died last week on Monday at the age of 54. The chopper carrying the remains of the ex-legislator landed in Gem minutes to 10.30 am. The body was received by close family members, clergymen and mourners. Police officers had a rough time managing the crowd that has milled around to catch glimpse of the casket containing the body of the former MP. “Keep some distance, please. Keep some distance. Let’s create some space," a police officer said. People could be heard crying with pain and grief as the casket containing the body was offloaded from the aircraft. The casket was wrapped in polythene paper which was later removed for the coffin to be thoroughly sanitised. The body was first taken to the house of his first wife where only six people were been allowed in. Priests, his brother and his wives were among those allowed to access the house. The body was later taken to his second home at around 11 am to his second wife's house for a short prayer. Thereafter, the body will be taken to nearby school grounds where there will be some short speeches and prayers before the burial.
