Kirinyaga County Governor Anne Waiguru has expressed her continued support for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). Waiguru said on Wednesday that she remains a strong proponent of the BBI due to the positive changes contained in the bill. The governor said the proposal in the BBI document to have Cabinet Secretaries appointed from among elected leaders was best for the country because politicians understand issues bedeviling the nation from a unique angle. “For those who work in Cabinet ought to be elected, because the perception would be completely different. You understand the country very differently when you have come from an elected position as opposed to just a mere appointment,” Waiguru said. She made the remarks during a luncheon to bid farewell to the outgoing Council of Governor's (CoG) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Justice Jackeline Mogeni. Waiguru has reiterated that BBI proposals are good for the country. Mogeni is among the judges who were appointed by President Uhuru Kenyatta as judges at the Environment and Land Courts. Waiguru congratulated Justice Mogeni on her new appointment saying the judge was a "committed public servant who rightfully deserved the honour". The governor who worked as the Devolution CS during the formative stages of the devolved units said moving functions and establishing working structures for the counties was difficult and required wise counsel to navigate through. "There were a lot of expectations and demands, it was extremely difficult navigating through but we worked together with Justice Mogeni to ensure we have set a framework that we would work with," she said. She exuded confidence that the new judge will use her new role to protect and strengthen devolution. Justice Mogeni described the Governor as a strong defender of devolution and her personal friend who stood with her at all times. "She gave me a shoulder to lean on in my most trying times, I owe the council a lot," she said.
