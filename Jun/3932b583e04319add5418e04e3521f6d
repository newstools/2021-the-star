Team Kenya to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics started checking into the final Olympics pre-departure bubble camp at Kasarani, from Monday. More members of the contingent are expected in camp with the last group set to arrive on June 24. The teams are resuming after taking a short break. Olympic Kenya acting secretary-general Francis Mutuku said they had already received Kenya Lionesses. “The rugby women’s team was the first to check into the camp on Monday, with the first order of business being Covid-19 testing,” said Mutuku. “The Taekwondo team will follow suit on Tuesday, and athletics will report on Wednesday this week. The final team to get into camp will be rugby men, who are expected on Thursday,” he added. The volleyball women’s team, Malkia Strikers, and boxing team ‘Hit Squad’ were already in camp at Kenyatta University and Kasarani respectively. “The camp is expected to take place under a strict bubble, to keep athletes safe from Covid infections while closely monitoring their health and ensuring compliance with Tokyo requirements on Covid-19 before entry into Japan,” added Mutuku. The teams will reside in their respective camps up until they start leaving for Kurume City, with the first team scheduled to leave on July 8.
