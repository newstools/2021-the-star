Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi has said he will not join any coalition that will weaken him in the coming General Election. Mudavadi said his ambition is to take over from President Uhuru Kenyatta and not to support others to the ballot. “After my candidature in 2013 where I was position three, so many people accused me that I am not a team player and I am not supportive and I gave them a chance in 2017 but we are still in the opposition,” Mudavadi said. “This time we are going to face off against each other squarely. I won’t leave anything to chance,” he added. Mudavadi spoke on Monday evening in Emuhaya subcounty when he visited the home of Omboko Milemba. Milemba is currently the ANC chairperson in Vihiga county and MP for Emuhaya under ANC party. Mudavadi said it is his time to take over and change the economy of this country that is currently bed-ridden. He said the country is totally crippled by debts. The young generation is down on their knees. Counties as well have failed to sustain and empower them economically. Mudavadi said for him to fight at the national level he needs bargaining power that will give him strength. “I can’t be telling people out there to vote for me. I want to be the president of this country and I don’t have the command of Western region,” he said. His sentiments were echoed by Emuhaya MP Milemba  who said without strong support and enough numbers Western region will be locked out. Mudavadi now wants those who are not in ANC within the region to reach out and join the party as a way of strengthening it. He further said the BBI has some good proposals that should be passed by Parliament for the benefit of the public. “Increase of funds to counties and creation of the ward fund doesn’t need a referendum but can be implemented via the Parliament,” Mudavadi said.
