Some 296 health workers in Mombasa county have so far tested positive for Covid-19 since the first case of the virus was reported in the country last year. The cases represent 6.66 per cent of all health workers in the region. There are 4,500 medics in the county. Of the reported cases, three health workers died from the disease. Between January and June this year, 59 health workers have tested positive for the virus. Kenya National Union of Nurses chairman Mombasa branch Peter Maroko said the majority of those infected have recovered. “We have a large number of health workers who have been infected by Covid-19, but they received treatment and were discharged from hospitals,” he said. On Thursday, public health chief officer Pauline Oginga urged residents to adhere to Covid-19 protocols. She said the economy of Mombasa county heavily relies on tourism, which can only be sustained through ensuring people adhere to safety guidelines. “It has come to our attention that bars and clubs have ceased observing Covid-19 measures, with some hosting live bands and shows. This will result in a surge that will force businesses to close, hence job losses,” Oginga said. She said it is the responsibility of everyone to keep the county safe. Maroko said people continue to ignore prevention measures, especially at public meetings. “Majority of people are not wearing masks, washing hands or sanitising. That is why there has been an increase in Covid-19 cases in the region,” he said. So far, the county has issued the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine to 3,144 people out of the targeted number of 29,417, who received the first dose. Out of the 4,500 targeted health workers in Mombasa, 4,209 received their first dose and 914 received their second dose. Others are 236 teachers, 128 security officers, 931 people aged over 58 years and 935 are other members of the public. Maroko said the number of people turning up to receive the vaccine in the country was still low.
