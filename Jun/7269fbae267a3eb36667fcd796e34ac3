A Kenyan who had gone missing in Minnesota two weeks ago has been found dead. Keegan Oyugi, 26, was found dead in a single-vehicle crash in the south metro. Minnetrista Police Department police said a car found off Highway 101 in Savage belonged to Oyugi. Police said they found his body buckled in the car seat. “As we await formal identification from the medical examiner’s office, our thoughts and prayers go out to the Oyugi family,” the police said. The Minnesota State Patrol is investigating the crash scene, and the Hennepin County Medical Examiner will formally identify the victim in the days ahead. According to Minnesota news, the westbound lanes of the highway in the south metro suburb were closed after someone reported seeing a badly-damaged red car in a copse of trees. Oyugi 26, was wearing a striped red and white shirt with one blue stripe, dark blue jeans and red and black shoes before he went missing. Prior to his disappearance, Mshale news indicated that Oyugi had sent a text to his younger brother that he was headed home from the Prior Lake/Savage area to their home in St. Bonifacius. But he never made it home.  Oyugi is 5-foot-9 180 pounds with black hair and brown eyes. Oyugi graduated from Wichita Southeast High School and went on to play basketball at Neosho County Community College in Kansas. He then moved to Minnesota in 2017 to enroll at Crown College .
