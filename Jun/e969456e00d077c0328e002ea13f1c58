Wajir is among 12 counties chosen to benefit from free legal services to be provided by the EU and the national government for Sh900 million. The European Union in conjunction with the national government have launched an initiative to provide free legal services to residents in 12 counties. During a ceremony hosted by Wajir county commissioner Jacob Narengo on Wednesday, a delegation from the Attorney General’s office led by Flora Bidali said the programme aims to provide legal services to the locals who cannot access legal aid. “We aim to staff offices with legal staff in the 12 counties who are readily accessible, to provide legal services to those least capable of accessing legal aid,” Bidali said. While handing over office space to the legal team, Narengo said there is need for the team to carry out stakeholder forums to sensitise the community and create awareness about their activities. “The need for legal services is overdue since there aren’t many establishments in Wajir offering these services,” Narengo said. Speaking during the function, European Commission representative Gerassimus Fourlanos said the five-year programme will eventually be cascaded to all the 47 counties. He said that the 12 counties were chosen based on their urgent need for legal services. “To enable us provide legal aid, we hope to work with elders to enhance traditional conflict resolution mechanisms. We intend to accompany security agencies to create awareness during public meetings and also learn the specific challenges faced by potential clients,” Fourlanos said. The delegation also paid courtesy calls at the Wajir prisons, police and judiciary departments.  (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
