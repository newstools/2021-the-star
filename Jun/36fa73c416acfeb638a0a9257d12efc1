Gospel musician Ben Githae has advised couples who are unhappy in their marriages to walk out and find love elsewhere. Speaking to Word Is, Githae said polygamy is allowed in our society. "Polygamy is allowed in the old testament. Even wife inheritance is allowed. It is only abnormal for a woman to have more than one man," he said. "If you are not okay with the one you call your wife, do not kill yourself in an unhappy marriage. Divorce and decide for a second chance with someone else or stay single." Asked about men who leave their wives for girlfriends, he said men stray for different reasons. "Some have sexual issues. The Bible is very clear that one man can have up to seven women who can be identified with him."
