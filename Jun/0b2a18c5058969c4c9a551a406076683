This is the Safari and it's never over until it is over. Forget the fast and furious modern-era competitive stages, Safari is just special. It is tough and the ever-unpredictable road conditions decide who has the last laugh. No one can tell the story better than Hyundai Motorsport’s driver Thierry Neuville. After dominating the event for two days and almost sure of victory, things happened very fast for the Belgian driver on the penultimate stage and before he knew it, he was out. Yes, a badly damaged rear right suspension on his i20 Hyundai  Coupe after he hit a rock midway through the test blew up his dream of winning the African rally. This year’s rally has been branded a ‘Clever Man’s Rally’ and indeed it lived up to the billing. Safari has proven it was not all about break-neck speed but brains and patience and indeed this came to pass as the author of the phrase ruled supreme. Our very own reigning African champion Bayan Manvir can relate better with the story. He lost the 2019 Safari on the very last Kedong stage, which is synonymous with thick volcanic ash soil dust. Like Neuville, Manvir had been leading the Safari through the last day but his radiator problems gifted “Flying Sikh” Baldev Chager Singh victory.
