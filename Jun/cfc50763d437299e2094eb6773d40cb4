Residents of Buxton who gave up their houses for refurbishment will only need a 10 per cent deposit when buying the new units. The special payment plan will not apply to other clients who will be required to pay 20 per cent deposit. While other clients will have to pay the deposit immediately, the residents will be given a grace period of six months. "We had promised the residents they will get first right and lenient purchasing plan. This is what we are actualising," Buxton Point CEO Ahmed Badawy said. Buxton Point is the developer in the Sh6 billion project being undertaken in a private-public partnership agreement between Mombasa county and developer Suleiman Shahbal through his firm. Badawy spoke on Saturday at Sheikh Zayed Hall during a meeting with over 500 residents. They were taken through the process of application and acquisition of the new units once complete. The residents met lawyers and representatives from different banks who took them through the proposed payment plans. Badawy said they are in talks with the county government to ensure that the tenant purchase scheme is also actualised. The residents have been pushing for the scheme to be provided to them. County Lands chief officer June Mwajuma said residents should take advantage of the lenient terms and strive to be homeowners. "One of the major concerns the residents have is the tenant purchase scheme. This would be the best mode for a majority of them to acquire the houses," Mwajuma said. She noted that a conversation with the national government is necessary. More than 1,800 units will be constructed in the Buxton Point project to replace the 545 ones that had been condemned. Before the start of the project, legal battles emerged as a section of the residents opposed the move. However, the developer won a case in court initiated by the project opponents. Shahbal said Mombasa needs more investments like this to ensure development in the county.
