Jobs platform BrighterMonday has announced the launch of its new and improved Best Match product designed to help employers find the best match for their roles. The enhanced Best Match product is an automated candidate matching system that saves employers time and effort by screening, testing, and ranking the high volume of candidates received for an application. With this solution, employers get a shortlist of 10 “qualified” and “tested” candidates who match their job description the best in just 7 working days. BrighterMonday Kenya Chief Executive Emmanuel Mutuma noted that for employers, hiring the right talent for their job roles remains a major challenge and finding the best talent, both in culture and in skill-set, can be daunting. “We have upgraded our Best Match solution to give employers access to advanced technology to help them test and get the 10 most “qualified” and “tested” candidates in a record 7 days,” said Mutuma. With Best Match, employers get additional benefits such as a complimentary assessment worth Sh15,000, increased visibility and reach by matching the job roles to both qualified passive and active jobseekers. According to BrighterMonday Product Lead Ezra Kimondo, adoption of technology at the sourcing stage will help businesses in managing a high volume of unfiltered applicants. “Businesses are increasingly recruiting and the new Best Match is designed to make work easier for employers by providing advanced technology to screen, test, and rank only the most qualified for open roles listed on the platform,” he said. Over the next four weeks, BrighterMonday is looking to partner with new and existing employers, introducing them to the new way to match through Best Match.
