Many county governments spent Covid-19 funds on non-essentials instead of channelling the cash towards key interventions to curb the spread of the virus, a new report has revealed. The budget implementation review report by Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakang’o shows counties spent Sh4.77 billion on Covid-19 mitigation measures in nine months of 2020-21. A huge chunk of the cash was splurged on items such as payment of water and electricity bills, travel, fuel, lubricants, allowances, advertising and hospitality. Some of the money was spent on maintenance of motor vehicles, purchase of airtime and body bags and renovations of health facilities. The total expenditure, however, excludes nine counties that did not make any disclosures on the budgetary allocation towards fighting the pandemic. The nine are Homa Bay, Isiolo, Kajiado, Kakamega, Kilifi, Machakos, Mandera, Nyamira and Nairobi. Ten others only gave aggregate allocations without disclosing particular items they acquired.
