A Sh14.1 million corruption case against Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko will be heard from September 27. The new hearing date was set on Thursday by Anti-corruption magistrate Thomas Nzioka. Two protected prosecution witnesses have since testified. The third witness is expected to proceed with his testimony after he was stood down during the last hearing. The court directed that an application by the Director of Public Prosecution seeking to adduce fresh evidence in the case against Sonko and his co-accused persons be heard on August 31 before trial magistrate Peter Ooko. Nzioka ordered the parties to file their responses and submissions within seven days. Sonko, Fredrick Odhiambo trading as Yiro Enterprises, ROG Security Limited and its director Antony Otieno Ombok alias Jamal have denied charges of conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption, conflict of interest, money laundering and acquisition of proceeds of crime. The prosecution alleges the governor in December 2018, received an indirect private interest of Sh8.4 million from Odhiambo over the hiring of heavy equipment. ROG Security and its director Jamal are accused of unlawfully receiving Sh14 million through Equity Bank from Odhiambo. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
