The Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations U-23 Championship earlier scheduled for June 3 in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia has now been pushed to July 17th. The development was brought to public light on Monday afternoon through a statement signed by Cecafa executive director Auka Gecheo. “Following a meeting that took place today and also attended by seven general secretaries from Cecafa member associations via zoom, it was decided that the competition is postponed by two weeks. The regional football governing body said they had been pushed by a number of factors to reach the decision. “The change was necessitated by some of the member associations having their countries go into lockdown due to Covid- 19 and are struggling to get government approval to travel to the event,” read the statement “The change was also made because the South Sudan technical bench and some of their players are currently being quarantined in Doha, Qatar after attending the Arab Fifa Cup and will only travel on the 7th of July. The league in Tanzania is also still ongoing and will be completed on July 18th, 2021 with some players only being available to travel after it is complete. Meanwhile, Cecafa gave an assurance of Ethiopia's total commitment to host the event. “Hosts Ethiopia has made it clear that they are ready to host the tournament and their plans will continue.”
