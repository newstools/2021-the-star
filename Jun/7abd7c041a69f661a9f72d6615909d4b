Uganda's Transport Minister General Katumba Wamala has been shot and injured by unknown gunmen near his home in the capital Kampala. Eyewitnesses say the gunmen were riding on a motorcycle. General Wamala is a former army commander. Over the last few years, the country has been rocked by such shootings by armed men riding on motorcycles. In June 2018, Ibrahim Abiriga, a flamboyant politician and ardent supporter of President Yoweri Museveni, was shot and killed near his home. Former police spokesperson Andrew Felix Kaweesi was assassinated in a similar manner in April 2017. A magistrate and several Muslim clerics were killed in the same way. None of the assassinations has ever been successfully investigated or prosecuted
