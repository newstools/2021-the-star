Former Majority Leader Aden Duale has termed a "bluff", reports there is a plot to delay 2022 polls. A local daily had indicated that Deputy President William Rutoâ€™s allies had alleged a plot to defer the General Election to ensure conclusion of the BBI process and buy time to plan President Uhuru Kenyatta's succession. Articles 101(1), 136, 177 and 180 of the Constitution sets the date of the election for Members of Parliament, the President, Members of County Assemblies and the Governors as second Tuesday, August - every fifth year. "Now it's just a bluff that one can ignore this date and peddle rumours or even insinuate that we postpone elections. It's not possible, not feasible and not tenable with these clear provisions of the Constitution," he said. Via Twitter on Monday, Duale said these provisions are also tied to Kenya's term of office as elected representatives which is five years and not one day more. "You may need to overhaul and negate several provisions of the Constitution to change the date," he said. "Now like I have submitted before, should one wish to even argue that you can extend the term of Parliament again this can only be in case Kenya is at war as envisaged under Article 102(2). We are not at war." Duale urged Kenyans to ignore the rumours and believe in the Constitution. "...call it a bluff any debate you hear that we can postpone elections or otherwise extend the term of Parliament. It is just a bluff and kwa lugha ya mtaani you can call it 'vioja mahakamani au sarakasi to!' Jameni tuache sarakasi," he said.
