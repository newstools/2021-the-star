Zetech University Sparks beat Africa Nazarene University 45-25 in a women’s Premier League match at University of Nairobi grounds. The winners took a 14-10 first quarter advantage and never looked back. ANU did well in the second stanza, closing in 9-10 but still trailed 24-9 at the breather. The second half was easy for Zetech,  rolling away 14-6 and keeping ANU scoreless with a 7-0 run in the last quarter. Sparks’ Jelimo Ledisha hit 11 while Beryl Aoko and Debra Atieno combined for 12. Mercy Mumo tallied 11 that included three 3-pointers for the losers. “We did well in the first half but ran out of gas in the late two quarters. They totally out rebounded us on both ends of the floor. We trained for only two days and it showed,” said ANU’s Mike Oluoch. In the matches played at the previous day, Strathmore University Blades cut Kenyatta University Pirates 68-55. “It was not a pretty game as we have been rusty from long lay-off and it was uncertain if the matches would go on,” said Blades coach Tony Ochieng. In the ladies matches, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology hit Safe Spaces 42-39 and ANU pipped KU Oryx 50-47.
