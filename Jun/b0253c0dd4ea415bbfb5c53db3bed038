Petroleum CS John Munyes snubbed the Senate Committee on Energy before which he was expected to appear and explain the increase of fuel price in the last few months. The CS was to appear before the committee chaired by Senator Ephraim Maina on Wednesday. Following the move, the committee has asked the CS to appear before it on June 14  or risk being arrested. Munyes was to explain why the pump price was hiked by Sh3.56 in the latest fuel price review. Currently, super petrol retails at Sh126.37 per litre, diesel at Sh107.66, and kerosene at Sh97.85 per litre in Nairobi. This, despite the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority citing a 0.6 per cent decrease in the average landing cost. In its latest review, the authority assured the public of its continued commitment to the observance of fair competition and protection of the interests of both consumers and investors in the energy and petroleum sectors. Earlier, in March, the CS defended the hike in fuel prices after EPRA released petroleum pump prices for the period March 15 – April 14, 2021, resulting in a public outcry. The CS said that EPRA uses a formula outlined in the Energy (Petroleum Pricing) Regulations of 2010 to calculate the applicable petroleum pump prices. He said that the computation takes into account the landed costs, supplier margins, government taxes plus storage and distribution costs. “Petroleum is imported into Kenya through the Port of Mombasa and transported to the hinterland via the pipeline system operated by the Kenya Pipeline Company Limited (KPC). The last-mile delivery of petroleum products from the KPC depots to the retail stations or other points of consumption is undertaken through road tankers,” Munyes said. In August 2020, the CS snubbed the summon of the same committee, where he was to justify the Petroleum Development Levy Fund which was effected on July 15.
