The Francis Atwoli Raod signpost along Kileleshwa, Nairobi has yet again been vandalised, this time burned by unknown people on the wee hours of Tuesday. This comes barely two weeks after the same signpost near Kenya High School was removed. Atwoli later condemned the move saying the vandalisation was an act of impunity and primitiveness. “In a country that believes in the rule of Law there are procedures and processes to be followed when unsatisfied,” he said. “ I am against anarchy. However, the police will look into that.” The signpost has attracted uproar from Kenyans since it was renamed from Dik Dik Road in honour of the Cotu secretary-general. After the signpost was reinstated, security guards were seen manning it during the day. On Tuesday morning, pictures of the signpost circulated on social media, showing how it was burnt using old tires. Nairobi County Government named the road in May after Atwoli, in a ceremony led by the Acting Governor, Ann Kananu alongside other county officials. During the ceremony of recognition, Atwoli said it was in honour of his service to Kenyan workers. In June 2017, the National Addressing System Strategy Development and Implementation Committee proposed new rules prohibiting the use of names of living persons. The rules abolished any changes to existing street names. The proposed guidelines said the CS for information and communications through the Communications Authority of Kenya, would have oversight responsibility regarding the national policy and standards on street-naming and property numbering. The county has also renamed Nairobi's Accra Road to Kenneth Matiba in honour of the veteran politician, who had died three years earlier. Nairobi County Assembly passed a motion to rename Accra Road after the former Ford Asili party leader, in his honour.
