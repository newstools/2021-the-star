John Orinda, the father of DJ Evolve has dismissed reports that his son is dead. Speaking exclusively to Word Is, John Orinda denied the reports saying that his son is recuperating well at his brother's home. "He is doing fine. The device that was put on his throat is still there, he is not talking yet," he said. "I have been called by another journalist asking about the same. Whoever is spreading that information is not a good person. "A person who can proclaim death on someone alive? What kind of a person is that? It is not good at all. I have called my son, who stays with him, and he is doing fine," said John Orinda. Word Is reached out to Evolve's father after the death reports started doing rounds on social media. Felix Orinda has been bedridden for over a year after being shot by Embakasi East MP Babu Owino at Nairobi's B-Club in January 2020. He was immediately rushed to Nairobi Hospital where he was treated for months. Later, Evolve was discharged and has since been receiving treatment at home. He has not gained his mobility yet but hopes to stand on his feet one day and embark on his entertainment job. In a past interview with Radio Jambo, Orinda explained that DJ Evolveâ€™s younger brother is the one taking care of him at home. "He has a nurse 24 hours and his small brother is taking care of everything." Orinda said that when he was in the hospital, the doctors told him that his son is alive by the grace of God. He said that his memory is still okay and that he can piece things together and remember dates. Adding that his friends still keep in touch.
