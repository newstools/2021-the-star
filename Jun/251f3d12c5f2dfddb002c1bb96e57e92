Denmark star midfielder Christian Eriksen is awake and his condition is stable. The midfielder collapsed on the field during the first half of the match, and received urgent medical attention of a UEFA Euro 2020 match against Finland. Former Arsenal and England physiotherapist Gary Lewin, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: "The medical team will have gone into what we call the 'emergency action plan'. "Every team and stadium has an action plan. The medical team will have tried to stabilise him on the pitch. I have to commend the players, the way they protected him and stood around him, I thought was incredible. It showed amazing team spirit. "Once the team have stabilised him, they would have got him into the cardiac position as soon as they possibly could. I think that's obviously where he is now. I believe the early reports are he is conscious, so let's cross our fingers. "The picture of him leaving the ground with oxygen, that's another sign that whatever happened, the action taken by the medical team was very, very quick and very, very efficient. "All I can say is what an amazing job they all did."
