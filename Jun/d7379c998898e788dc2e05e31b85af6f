 At least 250 inmates at the Kisii Prisons have been put in isolation as Covid-19 spirals in the region. Eleven prisoners have so far tested positive and health officials across the county are scales up surveillance. County commissioner Allan Machari said at least 1,820 have tested positive since the outbreak in March last year. More than 50 people have died. Already, the government has imposed a 7pm-4am curfew to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. By Monday, doctors at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital were attending to 36 cases in Covid wards, while an additional 150 patients were receiving care at home. Machari told journalists at his office that the infection rate in the region appears to have jumped to 20 per cent in two weeks. "A positivity rate of this magnitude is not very attractive and that is why we are still urging our people not to relax in observing the guidelines set by the Ministry of Health," he said. Kisii Central was flagged as the main hotspot. Churches will remain closed for the next one month as the government monitors the pandemic. He told the clerics to be understanding, saying it was about efforts to scale down the infection. "This is not about gagging worship but an effort to stem the infection," Machari said. Burials will admit 50 mourners, while weddings host a maximum of 30 people, he said. The commissioner flagged off a caravan from the ICT ministry to sensitise residents to the disease.Â It started from Kisii Central, Masaba South on Monday and will head to Sameta, Gucha and Kenyenya on Tuesday. It will close with a sensitisation drive in Kisii South's Marani and Nyamarambe on Wednesday. The commissioner said the government has put together a team to step up the monitoring of the disease.
