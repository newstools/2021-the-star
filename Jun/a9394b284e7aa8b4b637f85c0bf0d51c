Gaspo captain Vivian Akinyi is worried of Wadadia’s red-hot striker Ruth Chebungei ahead of the Kenya Women’s Premier League play-off match on Saturday at Nakuru Showground. The custodian, who has conceded 16 goals in 14 matches, has urged her teammates to give their best if they are to stop Chebungei . A win against Wadadia will guarantee coach Isaac Maluki-side a chance to face defending champions Vihiga Queens in the penultimate match. “There’s no shortcut to achievement. We will approach the game with a winning mentality and our formation should be spot on,” the shot-stopper said. “We believe we are the best and it is time to show our true qualities. How we structure ourselves during the game will be vital. Chebungei is lethal but we are ready. We recovered from a poor start in the league and we feel we have a genuine chance to win the title,” she said. Gaspo finished second in Zone ‘A’ with 29 points as Wadadia claimed the third spot in Zone B—booking a date for the pulsating clash. While Gaspo have no injuries , Wadadia will be without injured captain Monica Odato. The hawk-eyed goalkeeper is out for about eight weeks after dislocating her left knee in training two weeks ago. A newbies’ affair between Ulinzi Starlets and Nakuru West Queens is expected to be a high-octane encounter. Nakuru were the surprise package to reach the playoffs and will have to shake off the ‘underdogs’ tag. Nakuru coach Ben Peters Esitoko, in a recent interview with the Star, revealed his charges have nothing to lose and will give their best shot irrespective of the opposition. “Ulinzi will face a totally different team from the one they beat in Kitale. Currently we are brave and tactically astute,” Esitoko said. Ulinzi will rely on the goal-scoring exploits of the trio of Lucy Mukhwana, former Starlets U-20 captain Neddy Atieno and Siliya Rasoha, who have torn defences throughout the season. The winner will face  Thika Queens.
