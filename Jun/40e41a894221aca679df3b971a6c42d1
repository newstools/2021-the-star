Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu has undergone the 25th surgery  following an assassination attempt on September 7, 2017. The incident happened during the reign of the late President John Magufuli, when he was shot 16 times. Since the incident, Lissu has been living in Belgium as he undergoes treatment. Up to date, no one has been convicted for the assassination attempt. On Tuesday, Lissu tweeted that it is time for the current Tanzanian President Samia Sululu to reveal to him and the world the people who were behind the attempt. He also wants the government to disclose those who gave the orders for his attack. “With Magufuli gone, it's time new President Samia told me, the nation and the world who's behind the shooting and why? Who gave what order to whom? Her silence on this issue can't hold any longer,” Lissu said. In July last year, Lissu returned home where he launched his presidential campaign using on a Chama cha Demokrasia na Mageuzi party, well known as Chadema. His party was defeated by the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinzuzi (CCM) in last year's general elections, but Lissu termed the election shambolic. Lissu had refused to accept defeat in an election that he said was marred by rigging and violence by state agencies. The opposition had also asked Commonwealth Secretariat and the African Union to investigate claims of electoral fraud, violence, and human rights violations in Tanzania. The claims are said to have delegitimized the presidential elections which took place in Tanzania on Wednesday, according to a filing from lawyers for the leading opposition candidate. CCM has been the ruling party since Tanzania's independence in 1961.
