Despite heading into this weekend’s playoffs against Ulinzi Starlets as underdogs, Nakuru West Queens are fearless and will fight for their lives to be crowned the new Women’s Premier League champions. Nakuru are determined to dethrone defending champions Vihiga Queens of the title while the on-song Vihiga attempt to win the title for the fourth consecutive time. Nakuru, the Zone ‘B’ newbies, put in a virtuoso performance  — culminating in a second-place finish and booking a date with Ulinzi — who also made their maiden appearance and silencing their critics by securing third place in Zone ‘A’. Even without fans at the Nakuru Showground, Ben Peters Esitoko — the Nakuru coach expects a cracking encounter. The goal-scoring exploits of the Ulinzi trio of Lucy Mukhwana, former Starlets U-20 captain Neddy Atieno and Siliya Rasoha, who have torn defenses throughout the season, do not faze Nakuru. Esitoko claims Nakuru has played tougher opposition than Ulinzi in the past and his charges will try to right the wrongs following their 2-1 loss to the soldiers in a tension-filled match at Moi Stadium, Kitale two years ago. “Anything is possible at this stage. We will give a shot at the title because the team fought all the way. Ulinzi will face a totally different team from the one they beat in Kitale — brave, technically and tactically astute,” Esitoko said. “We drew with Vihiga 2-2 at home and they beat us 3-2 at Mumias. Vihiga is a very dangerous team but we took valuable lessons from those matches. Even without our fans in the stands, we are still a force to reckon with and there will be a level playing field regardless.” Esitoko was of the opinion that the cut-throat competition in zone B has made Nakuru a steel team. Nakuru registered 27 points from 14 matches, losing twice and winning on eight occasions to mark a remarkable campaign that has been without resources and funding.
