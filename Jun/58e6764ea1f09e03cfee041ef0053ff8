A court in Kandara, Murangâ€™a county, has fined a man Sh20,000 or he serves three months in jail for allowing his seven-year-old son to drive his vehicle. Ayub Kinyanjui was arrested on Monday at Kirwara area in Gatanga after a video showing his son driving a Prado TX was circulated on social media. The suspect pleaded guilty to the charge of allowing an unauthorised person to drive a motor vehicle along Thika-Kandara road on June 12. Kinyanjui told principal magistrate Margaret Kinyanjui that he had taken his vehicle to a car wash before proceeding to a supermarket. He said he left his son unattended, only to find that he had driven the vehicle when he was filmed by observers. The principal magistrate said that only a person with a valid driving licence is allowed to drive.
