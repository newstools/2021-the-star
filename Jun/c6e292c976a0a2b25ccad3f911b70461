A woman was Wednesday night shot dead as she resisted a robbery in Nairobi’s Pipeline area. Phelidah Moraa, 41, was shot in the abdomen and later succumbed to her injuries after being rushed to a local hospital following the 9pm incident. Witnesses told police that Moraa was closing her shop in the area when a gang riding on a motorcycle struck. The gang grabbed  her bag which police and her workers say contained an unknown amount of money. Witnesses said she resisted, prompting one of the men to shoot her in the abdomen as they grabbed the bag. Moraa fell outside her shop as the gang grabbed the bag and escaped on the waiting motorcycle. Police said the gang rode off to an unknown place and efforts to trace them are ongoing. Police suspect the gang had been monitoring the victim’s movements while hanging around there before they struck. She was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival. Police and medical officials said she had bled too much. A postmortem is set to be conducted. Embakasi subcounty police commander Francis Kamau said they are looking for the gang behind the incident. He said a team of detectives is pursuing the killers. “We believe the killers will be caught soon,” he said, urging victims of robbery not to resist attacks for their own safety. “Nothing is worth your life,” he said in reference to gangs demanding cash and valuables from their victims of robbery. The area has been experiencing a fluctuating trend of armed crime with gangs armed with pistols and crude weapons attacking residents for cash and valuables. As part of efforts to address the menace, more police posts have been established in the area. This has seen more deployments of security personnel. Police say they have increased patrols in major informal settlements to address crime incidents. -Edited by SKanyara
