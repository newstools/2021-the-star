A man who allegedly hit and killed his two-week-old infant with a wooden bar during a fight with his wife has been charged with manslaughter. Brian Anyelo was accused of unlawfully killing baby Sharleen Adhiambo on May 11 in Kona area of Kayole within Nairobi. Anyelo pleaded not guilty before Makadara principal magistrate Stephen Jalango during a virtual appearance. The suspect was arraigned on May 17 alongside his wife Beatrice Adhiambo before a Makadara court under a miscellaneous application. Police constable Patrick Wachira of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said he was investigating a case of murder. In a sworn affidavit, Wachira said the incident occurred on May 11 at about 8:40pm after the accused had a quarrel with his wife. The argument led to a serious fight, the detective said. Anyelo is said to have picked a wooden bar that landed on the baby as he charged towards the wife. The infant was held by the mother. Adhiambo rushed the baby to Mama Lucy Hospital where she succumbed to the injury. Wachira had asked the court to allow him to detain the suspect for 10 days pending investigations. He had requested more time to trace and record statements from potential witnesses, conduct a postmortem examination and a mental assessment test on the suspects. When the matter came up on Wednesday for a plea, only Anyelo was charged. Police intend to use his wife to testify against him. Jalangâ€™o granted the accused a bond of Sh500,000 with a surety of the same amount. The magistrate directed the matter to be mentioned on June 16. The hearing begins on November 11.  Edited by P.O
