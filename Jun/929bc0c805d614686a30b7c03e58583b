Police are looking for a gang that shot and seriously injured a policeman in an attack in Ngong, Kajiado county. Chief inspector of police Philip Olenkindi was in the company of three other officers on Tuesday night when they were confronted by four gunmen. Olenkindi is the officer commanding Ngong police station. Police said the officers were driving in a police vehicle during a patrol when they spotted four pedestrians at about midnight. They stopped the men who were walking along Ngong-Kihara road. But one of the four men shot at the officers, injuring the OCS on the right shoulder. The gang then escaped towards Ngong Hills. No arrests have been made. Olenkindi was rushed to hospital by his colleagues. Doctors said the bullet exited and that the victim was in stable condition. A team was sent to the area on Wednesday to strengthen the probe amid fears of a re-emergence of gangs. Kajiado county police commander Muthuri Mwongera said they have deployed more personnel in the area to hunt down the gang. Mwongera urged for calm. He said adequate measures had been put in place to address insecurity fears.  Edited by P.O
