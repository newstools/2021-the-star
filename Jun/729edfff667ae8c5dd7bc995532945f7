Police in Kirinyaga west have launched a manhunt for a 28-year-old man from Kibingoti area in Ndia who is alleged to have killed his mother. The suspect, Moses Gitau, is alleged to have committed the killing by stabbing his 58-year-old mother Tabitha Muringo with a kitchen knife. Family members led by the deceased eldest daughter Lucy Wanja said her brother showed up at home on Wednesday evening carrying some red ribbons  used in funeral. “He came carrying two ribbons which he displayed from the main gate to the cattle shed. After about two hours of displaying the bizarre act, he stabbed our mother with a kitchen knife,” she said. Wanja says, the suspects fled after committing the act to avoid neighbours's wrath who got wind of what he did and were baying for his blood. Esther Muthoni,who is the mother to the deceased and grandmother to the suspect, says that his grandson had on several occasions attempted to torture his mother, an indication that he was baying for his blood. “He one time knocked out her tooth. It was shocking but we later resolved it through a family meeting,” she said. Area nyumba kumi chairman John Mwangi condemned the action and called for soberness and right upbringing of children. According to Mwangi, it is suspected that Gitau was using hard drugs and was under influence while committing the act “We are in shock. It is not normal for one to kill his /her parent. We want the police to find him and prosecute him,” he added. Kirinyaga west police boss Martha Ngetich said the weapon used in the murder has been recovered. She called on the public to be calm as they search for the suspect. She also advised them not to take law into their own hands by killing him. She instead asked them to report to the police or present him to the police once they see him. -Edited by SKanyara
