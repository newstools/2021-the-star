Kenyans will soon start receiving their passports at their doorstep. This after the Directorate of Immigration Services and Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK) launched a passports delivery service. The service will see PCK deliver passports to applicants at a convenient physical address of their choice, or at the nearest postal office. During the launch of the partnership, the two institutions signed an addendum to the initial MOU that will address countrywide coverage of passport delivery services as well as last mile door-to-door delivery by PCK. “In the era of Covid-19 pandemic, this strategic partnership will help Immigration services decongest their premises by having documents delivered to Kenyan’s doorstep,” said Dan Kagwe, the CEO and Postmaster General of PCK. Alexander Muteshi, the Director General, Directorate of Immigration Services said that when a passport is ready for delivery the client will receive a notification that contains a link to the postal passport delivery self-service portal. The applicant will then input the tracking number, personal details, select preferred delivery location and pay the minimal applicable delivery fee. The agreement will reduce the number of trips that passport applicants make to immigration offices to a single visit; for submission and biometrics. The partnership was necessitated by the need of the directorate to decongest and reduce the number of clients frequenting their offices as well as reduce the number of trips the client has to make in their quest to acquire a passport. The partnership comes at a time when PCK is establishing itself as the ideal delivery partner for Government Agencies. Kagwe said Posta Kenya is making efforts to respond to the fast-changing consumer needs in adaptation of new technologies, in order to enable the development of suitable last-mile delivery networks.
