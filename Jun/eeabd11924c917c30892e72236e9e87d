A Kisii county assembly official on Friday claimed his life is in danger over his role in annulling speaker David Kombo 's removal bid. Assembly deputy clerk David Mbaka has filed a complaint with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations office in Kisii. He is accusing an MCA of threatening his life on Wednesday evening in connection to the role he played in annulling the gazette notice confirming the removal of Kombo. The deputy clerk said the ward rep told him not to get involved in any matter touching on Kombo or risk facing an unspecified action. "It is interesting that some house assembly members are now taking matters personal. We are only discharging our duties as public servants," Mbaka said. The deputy clerk said he has no direct political role to play in the saga pitting factions in the assembly. He said the clerk acted outside the law when he issued a gazette notice okaying the speaker's impeachment. "Records show he was away on suspension and thus could not abrogate himself powers to issue a gazette notice," Mbaka said. The claims on life of the deputy clerk adds a new twist to the raging battle touching on Kombo's removal bid. The speaker has since gone to court to ward off the removal. Kombo said he is back in office courtesy of a court order which put on hold the impeachment proceedings until the matter is heard and determined. On Tuesday, three ward reps were injured at the Kisii county assembly after unsuccessful discussions to elect a new speaker. Police were called in to end the chaos. Those injured were part the ward reps rooting for the removal of the speaker. Some MCAs say the tension in assembly may cause delay in passing the passing of the budget.
