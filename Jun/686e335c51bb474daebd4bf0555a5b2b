Kenyan international goalkeeper Patrick Matasi is hospitalised after being involved in a nasty car crash along Kapsabet-Nakuru road at Lessos. Matasi, who currently features for St. George's in the Ethiopian Premier League, lost control of the car he was driving following a tyre burst. He is currently admitted at Kapsabet hospital where he was rushed in an ambulance, after receiving first aid at Lessos clinic. A close relative Albert Mulanda, told Citizen TV that Matasi’s wife and their child who were also in the vehicle suffered multiple injuries. “The car lost control after a tyre burst then rolled over,” said Mulanda. “Matasi was with his family and two brothers-in-law and currently the doctor is running some scans on him because he is complaining of chest pains,” he added. They were travelling from Kakamega to Nairobi when the accident took place. Mulanda revealed that Matasi had undergone several scans to determine the root cause of his chest pains. “Matasi is complaining of chest pains and shoulders. After the results, then we will be able to know what next step will follow,” added Mulanda.
