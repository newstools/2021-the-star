The woman whose body was on June 25 discovered from her rented house at Tala market in Matungulu, Machakos, choked to death. This is according to a postmortem conducted at Kangundo Level Four mortuary on Tuesday. Matungulu subcounty police commander Monica Kimani said the woman, only identified as Mueni, died after a large piece of meat stuck in her throat. Mueni’s body was discovered on Friday morning on the floor of her house. Kimani said she was a miraa vendor at Tala market and was living alone. The body was discovered by her boyfriend, who alerted neighbours, who, in turn, informed the police. “The boyfriend said he had stopped by the house at midnight and knocked on the door but no one opened. He went to his house and returned to his girlfriend’s house in the morning, knocked, but still no one responded,” Kimani said. “On peeping through the window, the boyfriend said he saw her lying on the floor, called neighbours who broke the window and got a child to open the door only to realise the woman was dead.” One of Munei’s friends told reporters that they were together with her until 10pm when both parted ways to their houses and no one knows what happened to her. “We urge the police to investigate the cause of her death,” said the friend, who declined to be named for fear of victimisation.
