Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has dismissed reports that Mt Kenya has split into west and east in the struggle to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta next year. Wamatangi said they have not had time to sit down with leaders from the east side of the region to discuss which route to follow. “We have never gone wrong as Mt Kenya. We know there are some politicians who want to take advantage of our population, perhaps by dividing us. We are still intact,” he said. “We shall sit down and come up with a way forward to bring to an end all this.”  The senator spoke at Kihara market in Kiambaa constituency last Saturday. After National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi was named the region’s spokesperson, leaders from Central dismissed the coronation, saying they were not involved or consulted. But leaders from Meru and Embu regions welcomed Muturi’s coronation. A week ago, Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi said Mt Kenya east will not support a kingpin from Mt Kenya west. He said Mt Kenya east has been absent from the political limelight for some time. Kiraitu said it is selfish for Mt Kenya west to imagine they can field another presidential candidate. “We supported Jomo Kenyatta, Mwai Kibaki and now President Uhuru Kenyatta. It’s their time to support us. It is not fair for Mt Kenya west to reject our spokesman so that they can replace him with theirs,” the Meru governor said. Meanwhile, Wamatangi appealed to Kiambaa residents to support Jubilee candidate Kariri Njama in the July 15 MP by-election, saying he has sought the seat several times. Wamatangi said he has known Njama since 2013 when contested for the MP seat but lost to former MP Paul Koinange. He lost again to Koinange in 2017. Kiambaa MP seat fell vacant after Koinange died on March 31. Edited by A.N
