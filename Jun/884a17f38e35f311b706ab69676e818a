Coastal darlings, Bandari, made light work of visiting Kariobangi Sharks, thumping them 4-1 in a one-sided Football Kenya Federation Premier League encounter at Mbaraki grounds on Friday. Omar Kasumba opened the floodgates in the 16th minute before William Wadri doubled the advantage in the 29th minute. Benjamin Mosha then found the back of the net in the 54th and 64th minute to bag a brace. Eric Kapaito grabbed a consolation for the visitors in the 47th minute to take his goal tally for the season to 15. The outcome takes the dockers to sixth on the log on 31 points.

At Thika Stadium, Nelson Chieta rose unmarked to head in Stephen Waruru's magnificent delivery from a setpiece in the 77th minute as the debutants went ahead to silence Vihiga United 1-0. Nairobi City Stars maintained their impressive run in the league with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Nzoia Sugar at Narok Stadium. The win has propelled City to fifth with 32 points, reigniting their remote dreams of laying claim to their maiden top-flight title.
