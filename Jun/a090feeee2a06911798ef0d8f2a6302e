Set piece and defence are the two areas Kenya under 20 coach Curtis Olago will want to improve on before the Barthes Cup kicks off in 10 days at Nyayo stadium. "We have to improve in these two areas in the next one week if we are going to be competitive at the one-week tournament,” noted Olago. He said the team is at 40 per cent in terms of preparations and hopes they will have scaled up the statistics in time for the event. "Our training has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic but the boys are working hard as we hope will be able to tick some boxes,” said Olago. Olago spoke after his charges beat Kenya  Cup outfit Mwamba 12 -10 in a friendly match played at RFUEA with Amos Mukoro and Collins Indeche scoring a try each. He added that competition for places in the squad is improving following a month of intense training. Chipu have played three build-up matches so far — two matches against Menenegai Oilers, winning one 24-22 and losing 26-13, and beat KCB 13-10. Olago hopes to subject his players to another friendly encounter before deciding his 30-man squad for the tournament. Defending champions and hosts Kenya will face off with powerhouses Namibia, Senegal and Madagascar for the sole ticket to the Junior World Rugby Trophy competition slated for next year. Kenya hosted the 2019 edition at the KCB Sports Club in Ruaraka, beating Namibia  21-18 in the final to qualify for the Junior Rugby World trophy in Brazil the same year, where they finished sixth under former coach Paul Odera.
