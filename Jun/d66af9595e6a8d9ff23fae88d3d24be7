Socialite Huddah Monroe says she was driven by the late billionaire Chris Kirubi to start a cosmetics business. Huddah said she met Kirubi several times at the airport, and itâ€™s him who inspired her. "This man used to see me in business class in almost all my travels. In Nairobi, there is no first-class lounge, so you all sit there in the business class lounge, waiting on the Emirates flight," she said. "When he asked what I do for a living, I didn't have an answer. He proceeded to upgrade me to first class. We had a lengthy talk coz I like to ask and learn from people. And I am happy that he was part of what inspired me to start Huddah Cosmetics." The billionaire died on Monday after a long battle with colon cancer.
