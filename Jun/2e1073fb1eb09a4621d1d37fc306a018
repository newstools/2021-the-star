Former Taita Taveta woman representative Joyce Lay has dropped her family name 'Lay' after joining the music industry. In an Instagram post, Joyce said she will be using 'Jewel' as her stage name. "I will not use my family name Lay anymore. I'm forced to pick a stage name. I am Jewel. This is because of my special mission with God," she said. Joyce added that her husband doesn't want to be associated with what she is called to do. "I truly understand him. So he said I have to drop the family name if I'm determined to follow my dreams. I chose the latter. I will follow my dreams to the end. This is what will lead to my success and fulfilment." Recently, Joyce said she is not running for any political seat, adding that people she trusted turned against her and that was the scariest place in her life. "To see your friend turning evil before your eyes. It's too early for me to go back now. It was too much for me. I lost everything. I had so much pain. I was shattered, broken, wounded and broke the whole time." She added that she has been offered the deputy governor's position in Taita Taveta but she is at a different stage away from politics. "This is where I'm happy most. So I want to hang around for a while and just enjoy the tranquillity. It's beautiful up here." She said she is in a happy space serving God. "God doesn't send you to everyone. You have to know whom you are called to. You will know after taking time with God, to understand your purpose."
