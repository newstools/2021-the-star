Ten matches are on the cards as the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) league resumes this weekend. But a crisis is looming at the Eldonets over the 72-hour coronavirus testing protocols, according to head coach Maurice Ouma. Ouma said the regulations are an extra expense and many teams can't afford to carry out the exercise now and then. “As a team, we have decided to shelve our matches to ensure we meet the requirements. The regulations are too tough for us as a team,” said Ouma. The Eldoret-based club was set to play Kenya College of Accountancy (KCA) on Saturday and the University of Nairobi on Sunday but have put the matches on hold. “As a team, we are prepared for the league but the restrictions have put us off. The majority of our players are university and college-going students who have fully resumed learning and training is on top gear,” said Ouma. He added that their sponsor can only facilitate transport and accommodation, not Covid-19 testing. “Our sponsor, who has been very supportive can only accommodate us and pay transport and we cannot dictate extra expenses on them,” added Ouma.
