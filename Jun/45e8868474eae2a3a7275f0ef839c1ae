A GSU officer who had been missing for about 17 days in Boni Forest has resurfaced, albeit with injuries. Police constable Norman Mwongera Kiunga was taking part in the multi-agency security operation Linda Boni in Lamu. He went missing in the vast forest during an operation but resurfaced on Thursday at Basuba GSU camp looking frail and emaciated. Police reports indicated that the officer was in stable condition but had two gunshot wounds; a bullet was lodged in his right thigh and another in his right forearm. “He showed up at the camp at around 9. 30am. He had gone missing during an operation in the Boni enclave. We are glad he is alive. He has two gunshot wounds and has been evacuated to Nairobi for specialised treatment," reads a police report. It remains unclear whether the officer was injured by al Shabaab militants or friendly fire. When reached for comment, Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia and police commander Moses Murithi denied knowledge of the happenings. “Officers in charge of the multi-agency operation in Boni Forest are in a good position to respond to this,” Macharia said. In July 2017 a police officer who had gone missing following an al Shabaab raid on Pandanguo police post in Lamu East was found alive after two days. The officer is said to have hidden in a nearby bush during the attack and managed to escape on foot during the night to Witu police station several kilometers away. He later found his way back to Pandanguo police post. On September 15, 2015, the national government launched Operation Linda Boni to flush out al Shabaab militants hiding inside Boni Forest.
