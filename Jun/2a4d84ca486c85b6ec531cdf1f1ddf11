Devki Group chair Narendra Raval is ready to start the revival of Mumias Sugar Company from next month if stakeholders and the receiver manager approve his bid. Raval had last week dropped his bid to lease the sugar miller following an uproar from some stakeholders. On Sunday, Raval said he will wait for 30 days to allow stakeholders including farmers, leaders and the local community to agree then renew his bid to take over the firm that has been under receivership since 2019. "Unless all stakeholders come together and the receiver too, I have no problem sitting with them and make a plan to have a way forward on how to jumpstart the firm in 30 days," he said. Raval said that he will bid to lease the miller for 20 years and was ready to inject Sh5 billion for the duration. He spoke at his Ruiru office. "I bid for Mumias with a good intention of reviving it and improving the livelihood of the farmers and the local community. If the farmers, the leaders and the receiver want me, I am willing to start it by July 1," he said. The industrialist said many people in the western region depend on the firm, either directly or indirectly and that his intention was to better their livelihoods. He said that the region's politics will determine if he continues with his move to run the firm, saying that dirty politics will keep him away. "Politics will be there. If it is healthy politics I have no problem but if it's dirty politics I'll keep off because we are business people and not politicians," he said. Raval also dismissed rumours circulating on social media that politicians from Western have reached out to him for bribes. "I am a renowned industrialist in this country and I wouldn't do anything that is not known by the people," he said.
