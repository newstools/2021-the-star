Some Tanzanians have launched an online petition to have Diamond Platnumz disqualified from the 2021 BET Awards. Diamond is nominated as the only East African artiste, under the category Best International Act. The petitioners allege the singer "actively and publicly supported the late President Magufuli’s regime". The petitioners also claim Diamond remained silent when fellow Tanzanian artistes were imprisoned and abducted in 2017-18 over video clips deemed obscene by the authorities. Diamond was also arrested after sharing a video clip on Instagram that showed him kissing a girl, but the petitioners claim that he remained silent and did not condemn the acts. “In 2017, he deliberately released a single called 'Acha Nikae Kimya' (Let me remain quiet) as a response to the increasing demand from the public to speak up and condemn the crackdowns," the petition reads. "Diamond to date has not condemned or spoken up on any of the atrocities committed.” Singer Harmonize took a jibe at Diamond, indirectly mocking him about his nomination. He compared Diamond to other seasoned Tanzanian artistes while insinuating they are ‘old.’ “BET, I know how you guys care about legends, 2022 please don’t forget Sir Nature and H.Baba.” Others who have been named in the Best International Act category include Aya Nakamura (France), Burna Boy (Nigeria), Emicida (Brazil), Headie One (UK), Wizkid (Nigeria), Young T & Bugsey (UK) and Youssoupha (France).
