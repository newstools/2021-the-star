Mansukh Patel, the proprietor of Solai Coffee Estate - where the Solai Dam tragedy occurred and left 50 people dead and hundreds displaced - is dead. Patel died on Monday at about 4pm at Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi where he was undergoing treatment following a short illness. Solai chief Kiragu Maina said the business magnate was at his Nairobi home when he was taken ill and admitted to hospital late last week. He said burial plans for the owner of Solai Group of companies - which include the biggest and oldest table salt company Kensalt Limited and Solai Coffee Estates which grows flowers, macadamia, coffee and other horticultural produce for export - are underway. "The man was still very active at the time of he got sick and he was touring his business projects in Kenya, Africa and abroad under Solai Group pf Companies," said chief Maina. Patel had maintained a low profile until May 9, 2018 when a mega Dam at his Patel Coffee Estate farm in Solai broke its embarkment. His son, Perry Mansukh was among nine people arrested and charged with the 50 deaths before being set free by the High Court in Naivasha for lack of evidence. Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui mourned the death of Patel, whom he described as a great farmer and industrialist.
