A man drowned near Sare beach in Suba South constituency on Tuesday evening during a fishing expedition in Lake Victoria. Hezron Wamalwa, 22, drowned after slipping from the boat as he was casting nets into the water. Wamalwa was in the company of three colleagues. “He stood to cast the net but he accidentally slipped into the lake and drowned as the boat was moving. The presence of a strong wind destabilised the boat,” Suba South Beach Management Unit chairman William Onditi said. His three colleagues waited for Wamalwa to resurface, but he did not. Onditi said they are still searching for the body. “We believe the body will resurface after three days as has happened to other people before,” he said. Homa Bay county police commander Esther Seroney urged fishermen to avoid going into the lake when it is windy. She said strong winds can cause boats to capsize. “We’re appealing to fishermen to understand the wind patterns as they undertake fishing activities in the lake. This will help us avoid such accidents,” Seroney said. She said they have partnered with local divers to look for the body.  Edited by A.N
