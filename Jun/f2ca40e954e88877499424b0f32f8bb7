When the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country in March 2020, schools were closed and the government recommended online learning for students who stayed home for close to 9 months. This saw internet subscriptions surge 5.1 per cent between April and June as demand for the service surged amid the stay-at-home measures, according to CA . Subscriptions increased to 40.9 million in the quarter ending June 2020 from 38.9 million in the period ending March, sector data shows. The Authority noted that this growth was attributed learners continued access to e-content and lessons at home following the closure of schools. For the July to December period, the internet subscriptions grew further to 43.4 million as the demand for online services grew.

The number of 3G broadband subscriptions declined to 13.3 million from 14.3 million subscriptions posted last quarter whereas, 4G broadband subscriptions grew by 8.3 in the referenced period to post 11.7 million subscriptions. The decline in 3G subscriptions was also attributed to the increase in inactive mobile data subscriptions following the resumption of physical learning in schools from the beginning of the year. The total number of short messages sent between January and March 2021 stood at 10.6 billion, down from 14.2 billion messages sent between October and December 2020.

Equitel also had a drop in market share from 2.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent while Telkom and Jamii Telecommunications remained at 6.2 and 0,3 per cent respectively. Airtel’s market share for calls also fell for the third consecutive quarter, hurting the telco’s efforts to close the gap on the dominant Safaricom.
