The body of a 19-year-old girl who went missing on Wednesday has been found at the Portreiz Hospital. Najma Abdullahi went missing after seeing off a friend who had visited their home in Changamwe area in Mombasa County. According to the deceased's sister Effrah Abdullahi, Najma did her KCSE exams in March at Karima girls where she got a B plain. She then went to Mombasa where she was staying with her. On the day of the incident, Najma left the house at around 4 pm to see off a friend. "I talked to her at around 6pm and she told me that she was on her way back home. But by 7pm, her phone was off and we could not trace her," Effrah said. After days of searching, the family came to learn of Najma's whereabouts in Portreiz after they were informed of an unknown person brought to the hospital by the police. Family lawyer Derrick Odhiambo said preliminary reports indicate Najma was found along Bonje road while unconscious. "Reports indicate that it's the police who actually took her to Portreiz hospital. She however succumbed hours later," Odhiambo said. The family lawyer said the girl might have undergone torture as her body had what they suspect to be stab wounds. The post mortem is expected to be conducted on Saturday at the Coast General hospital. Police have already launched investigations to unravel the mystery surrounding the death.
