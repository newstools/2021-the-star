Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka led a consultative meeting that brought together leaders from the lower Eastern region before leading them to State House. The meeting was held on Monday at the Sarova Panafric Hotel in Nairobi but snubbed by Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama. Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu and her Machakos counterpart Alfred Mutua were among the attendees. It also brought together elected, professional, opinion, and clergy leaders from the Lower Eastern region. They are expected to address issues that are facing the region to the president. The president is expected to make his visit to the region, after the Nyanza region tour he made in the lead-up to the Madaraka Day celebrations that saw a number of projects being launched to the region. During Uhuruâ€™s tour to the Nyanza region, he reopened the Sh3 billion refurbished port, injecting life into the economy of the lakeside city and the entire region. After decades of neglect and run down, Kisumu port finally roared back to life in what is expected to open up trade and boost the economy of the Eastern Africa region. He also launched the shipyard and laid the keel for the construction of the MV Uhuru 2 that will be built from scratch by the Kenya Navy in collaboration with Damen Civil Works, a Dutch company. The president also launched Sh2.4 billion water project in Gem Yala and Sh1.4 billion Akala-Wagai road in the constituency. He also commissioned the Shs1.6 billion Kodiaga-Wagai-Onyirore/Akala, and Nyangweso-Muhanda road circuit, and the Sh2.4 billion Siaya-Bondo water supply, and sanitation project in Siaya. Residents from the lower Eastern region are also waiting to see what the president has for them.
