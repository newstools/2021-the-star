Supermarket chain Quickmart director of finance Jacques Dome believes their support towards local driver Evans Kavisi and navigator Absalom Aswani will help the team put in a respectable performance during this week’s WRC Safari Rally in Naivasha. The retail store have branded Kavisi’s car No.50 ahead of the event set for between June 24 and 27 in the picturesque Rift Valley terrain. The event returns to Kenya following a 19-year absence from the WRC calendar. Dome said: “As a brand, we are very keen to partner with the World Rally Championship to ensure Kenya produces one of the memorable circuits in the series.” “We believe that this sponsorship will go a great length to ensure the drivers have everything they need to succeed. He said their prayer is to have the duo finish on the podium in their national category. “Our objective is to see our drivers win in our class, it is possible,” added Dome. “We also strongly believe the country will succeed in the organisation of the iconic WRC Safari Rally.”
