Kenya National Examination Council acting chief executive Dr Mercy Karogo will exit office at the end of June. Dr. David Njen'gere, who until his appointment was Education CS George Magoha's adviser, will take over. In a statement by Knec council chairperson Dr John Onsati, he said Njeng'ere will serve for a term of five year, effective July 1, 2021. Njeng'ere holds a Doctorate in Education from Moi University. He previously served as Deputy Director at both the Kenya National Examination Council and the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. Karogo was appointed as acting Knec CEO in 2016, following Joseph Kivilu's dismissal over widespread cheating in the 2015 KCSE exam. Before taking up the position, Karogo had served as senior deputy director and head of the Curriculum and Research Services department at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. She also held the chief executive officer post in acting capacity on several occasions.
