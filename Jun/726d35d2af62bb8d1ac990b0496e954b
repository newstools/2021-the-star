A case in which over 7,000 internally displaced persons from Nyamira and Kisii counties sued the state in 2017 over unpaid compensation has been pushed to June 26. The case was adjourned because the judge handling the matter, Weldon Korir, was out on official duties. In a petition filed at Milimani law courts, the IDPs led by Rev Nenwel Momanyi claim that Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and PS Karanja Kibicho have refused to compensate them. Momanyi said he has been moving from one court to another to represent his people in vain. They have also attempted to present their petition to the Senate and National Assembly in vain. â€œInstead of us, it was non-IDPs who were compensated and we travel from Kisii to Nairobi to listen to the case," Momanyi said. He pleaded with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to follow up the matter. They are seeking to have those who illegally received the money arrested and prosecuted. On June 6, 2017, President Uhuru Kenyatta released Sh358 million for the compensation of IDPs in Kisii county. The President later handed over another Sh472 million to displaced people in Nyamira. Uhuru said the beneficiaries were the last batch of people displaced by the violence. The team told the media outside Milimani law courts that their lives have worsened since the 2007-2008 post-election violence. Momanyi urged the court to act with speed for them to get justice which they have been following for the last 10 years.
