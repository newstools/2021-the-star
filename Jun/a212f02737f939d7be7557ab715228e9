Police have launched a manhunt for seven people who illegally exhumed a body on Wednesday night in Muhoroni, Kisumu. The body of Elijah Obuong, a nephew of Daniel Obudi, was buried on May 15 in Holo village, West Songhor sub-location. Obuong was one of the four men who disappeared from a Kitengela restaurant in April. The body of Obuong was found near Mukungai stream in Murang’a. Meanwhile, Chemelil chief Mourice Opiyo reported that the group, suspected to be from Uyoma in Siaya, invaded Obudi’s home and exhumed the body. County police commander Samuel Anampiu said the suspects came in a hearse whose registration number had not been established. They exhumed the body, removed it from the coffin, reburied the coffin, wrapped the body in a polythene bag, then drove away with it. It was alleged that the seven people included Caroline Obuong', the mother of the deceased. Their motive was yet to be established. The scene was visited and documented by police officers from Chemelil. Investigations are underway. Elsewhere, a body was found in Kisian along the Kisumu-Bondo road on Thursday morning. The body of Onyango, 27, was found by his brother Domnic Olunga. "The deceased was lying in a pool of blood, with a sharp cut wound in the forehead. He had left home on Wednesday but never returned," Anampiu said. He said investigations had been launched. The body was taken to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital awaiting a postmortem.
