Masinde Muliro University has postponed its 16th graduation ceremony, which was slated for June 11. Acting registrar for academic affairs, Prof Thomas Sakwa, said new dates will be announced later. "During the special senate meeting held today, June 3, 2021, it was resolved that the l6th graduation ceremony initially scheduled to take place on June 11 be postponed to a later date due to unavoidable circumstances," read a memo by Sakwa. Meanwhile, Sakwa said that preparations for the graduation ceremony and clearance by grandaunds were ongoing. The university does not have a functional council after the Employment and Labour Relations Court revoked appointment of five of the six council members. In the judgment delivered on April 7, Justice Stephen Radido declared the decision by Education CS George Magoha to gazette and consequently appoint Dr Name Musangi as the council chairperson and Stephens Mutoro, Conice Mogaka, Joshua Ogango and Githu Kiragu  as members on March 20, 2020 contravened the Constitution. The university has remained without substantive leadership for the last 29 months after the expiry of the term of former Vice chancellor, the late Prof Frederick Otieno, in November 2018. His replacement has been dogged with court cases. The institution has since been led by three VCs in acting capacity. All the three faculties at the university are headed by persons in acting capacity as well. Meanwhile, the university senate has asked the security organs to investigate the death of a third year student, Mackrine Achieng, on Wednesday night. Achieng’s body was found outside her hostel room in Kefinco estate. The senate also wants the national and county governments to erect high mast security lights in areas where hostels are situated for security of the students. They also want the university members to be part of the County Security team and sensitise the community on the importance of the university to them.
