Garissa Governor Ali Korane's bid for a second term in office has received a major boost after the Rer Mahaat community of Abduwaq subclan endorsed him. Elders, youth, women and religious leaders praised the governor's leadership and promised to support him in next year's general election. The community representatives from Fafi, Balambala and Garissa town subcounties presented a raft of issues they want addressed. They include youth and women empowerment and infrastructural development for Bulla Golol, Edo, Haji Jimay, Harbole and Dalolo. Elder Ahmed Ali said they have full confidence in the governor's leadership because he has initiated several life-changing projects in the area. Korane welcomed the endorsement and promised to continue developing all corners of the county as well as uniting communities. He said no government can meet all the needs of the people due to limited resources, but added that a good number of issues can be addressed within a specified time. “It is with great pleasure that I accept the earnest endorsement of the community members for my second term in the forthcoming 2022 elections,” the governor said. Korane urged political and opinion leaders and elders to weigh their words before uttering them, noting that people listen to their leaders and do what they are told without a second thought. “Elders play an integral role in uniting our communities, but at the same time they can use their positions to destabilise peace and destroy communities. I appeal to you to always weigh your words before uttering them,” he said. The governor has in the past two months been busy meeting elders from various clans in a bid to consolidate his support ahead of next year's general election. In Northeastern, clan elders play an integral role during elections. In most cases, the candidates they endorse end up winning in the general election. Edited by A.N
