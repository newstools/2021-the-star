Nakuru dairy farmers will offer free milk during celebrations to mark the elevation of Nakuru town into a city as a way of showcasing its economic importance and significance to residents. County executive for Agriculture Immaculate Maina said the suggestion was loaded with historical implications because the town was established by colonial dairy farmers, who pioneered the Kenya Creameries Cooperative that has processed domestic milk since independence. Nakuru Dairy Platform chairman Waweru Nyangi said the farmers felt indebted and appreciative because of the support they have continued to receive from the county government. Waweru said dairy farming was still the most profitable economic activity in the county due to its conducive climate and organised cooperative societies that have made it easier to market the product. He said dairy farmers' contributions in the county were visible with numerous buildings and businesses named 'Maziwa House'. Waweru spoke on Tuesday at the Agriculture executive's office. He said milk was precious to farmers because it nourishes their children and also pays for their school fees. Nakuru's quest to be elevated to a city is awaiting President Uhuru Kenyatta's okay after the Senate approved it last month. Once the date of the celebrations is announced, farmers said they will provide the free milk. The milk will be delivered in packets. Waweru urged Kenyans to make a glass of milk part of their daily meals. "During the festivity, we want to change the mindset of a number of adults who perceive milk as childrenâ€™s food and yet its nutrients are required for a healthy human being," he said.  Edited by P.O
