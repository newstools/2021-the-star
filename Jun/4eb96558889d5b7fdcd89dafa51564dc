A team of youths from Baringo County calling themselves 'Team Hustler' were received at the UDA headquarters on Wednesday during their familiarisation tour. The group was received by secretary-general Veronica Maina and commended them for their efforts in registering as UDA members. The over fifty members from six constituencies in the county were taken through the bottom-up approach, which the party said incorporates all Kenyans. Deputy President William Ruto has been popularising the economic model they are proposing which he says will touch the lives of millions of Kenyans at the bottom of the social and economic pyramid. According to the DP, through the bottom-up economic model, resources will be channelled to small businesses at the grassroots to spur economic growth. They said that they have so far registered over 15,000 members to the party. The youths also pledged to continue popularising the party and recruit new members at the grassroots level. This comes barely a week since Ruto held a meeting at his Karen residential home with MCAs from Baringo, who were led by Speaker David Kiplagat Kerich. During the meeting with MCAs, the DP dismissed the requirement that MCAs, governors, MPs, and the president should have a Bachelorâ€™s degree. Ruto termed Section 22 of the Elections Act, 2011as unreasonable, hence, the need to make an amendment to the Act.
