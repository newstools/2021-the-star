Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo on Monday launched two water projects that had been stalled for years. Nyaribo visited the ongoing water treatment area at Nyambaria Primary and Riogoro Primary schools in Kitutu Masaba. He was accompanied by National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority officials led by chairman Eric Okeyo (NWHSA). The county secretary James Ntabo, water chief Ombogo Marwanga, county officials and MCAs were also present. The governor told off a section of politicians who tell residents their areas have been ignored in terms of development, saying he has ensured each part of the county gets equal development opportunities. "I know this is a step some of my competitors are using against me but let me assure them that it is not that easy to do away with someone who is already in power," Nyaribo said. He called for speedy completion of the project so that residents can benefit from the water, instead of going long distances in search of it. Eric Okeyo said the county has signed a Sh42 million contract with the authority. The contract involves drilling, equipping and test pumping of 20 boreholes across the county. “We will do the best to ensure the project is completed at the required time since we have agreed on the same with the county,” Okeyo said. Director Abdi Dara who is also the chairman of the Finance committee of the board said the authority will look at the proposal to agree on further areas of engagement. Through this contract, NWHSA is expected to undertake hydrogeological surveys, drilling of boreholes to an average depth of 250 metres, casing, capping and test pumping the 20 boreholes. In their agreement, the authority and the county government came to an agreement for additional works and variations, whereby the tendered variation rates shall apply as shall the bill of quantities. Any variation on the project shall be discussed and mutually agreed upon in writing by the two parties. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
