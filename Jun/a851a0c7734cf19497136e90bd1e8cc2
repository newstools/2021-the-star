Two university lecturers have made a last minute dash to be admitted as amicus curiae (friend of the court) in the BBI appeal case to be heard from Tuesday next week. Professors Charles Fombad and Migai Aketch from the universities of Pretoria and Nairobi respectively made separate requests to the Court of Appeal. Both say they can provide independent and impartial opinions to help the court in examining the issues before it. The Court of Appeal on Friday certified their applications as urgent. They will be heard on Monday, before proceedings of the main appeals before the seven-judge bench headed by Court of Appeal president Daniel Musinga begins on Tuesday. Fombad heads the African Comparative Constitutional Law Unit at the Institute of International and Comparative Law in Africa based in the Faculty of Law at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. He is in axpert in comparative jurisprudence on constitution making within both the African and international context. “Its important that as amicus curiae he participates at every stage of the proceedings in these appeals,” he says in court papers. Fombad says he can assist the court to develop the law on the legal and constitutional questions before it. He has authored over 90 journal publications, over 50 book chapters and has consulted for the African Union on governance. Aketch says he is a governance expert at the African Union’s African Peer Review Mechanism. He wants to help the court better understand the history of the making of the Constitution of Kenya. “I have conducted extensive research on diverse aspects of constitutionalism, the rule of law and governance in Africa,” he says. He has authored two books and edited two others; published 17 journal articles, 21 reports and consulted internationally on constitutionalism, governance and the rule of law.  (edited by o. owino)
