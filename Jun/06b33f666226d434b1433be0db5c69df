An elderly woman was Wednesday found killed and her body left in her cow shed in Karambaini village in Limuru subcounty. Margaret Ngina's body was discovered by her friend Salome Njambi who had gone to visit her. Ngina was 81. Njambi did not find Ngina in her house and followed her phone's ringtone to the animal shed where she found the body. She started screaming, attracting residents who came to check what was happening. Limuru deputy police commander Gitonga Thumi said the body had signs of struggle and Ngina might have tried to fight off her attackers. Thumi said detectives from Tigoni police station have started investigations. Ngina’s farmhand has been arrested for questioning. “The woman lives at that home with her farm worker. Even if we cannot discuss much about investigations, we are holding her farm worker as a suspect as he helps us with details,” Thumi said. Residents said the suspect, a Ugandan, does not have friends in the village. The body was taken to Tigoni hospital mortuary, where an autopsy will be carried out as police proceed with the probe.
