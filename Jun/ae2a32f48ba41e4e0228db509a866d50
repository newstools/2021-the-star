Eight National Super League clubs from the 13 counties where sports activities were suspended during the spiraling Covid-19 cases now want the league suspended. The clubs Kisumu All-Stars, Migori Youth, Gusii FC, Silibwet Leons, Vihiga Bullets APS Bomet, Kisumu Hot Stars, and Soy United wrote to the Football Kenya Federation wanting the league to be stopped. “The federation should stop the league for a level playing field. Allowing teams to play away matches will lead to fixture congestion and fatigue which will disadvantage other teams,” said the letter to the FKF Chief Executive Officer Barry Otieno. They said that the teams have not been training since counties have closed playing fields. “Allowing the affected teams to play only away matches will be unfair because they don’t train,” read part of the letter. The officials from the eight teams rejected a proposal for the said teams to play their home matches at Narok Stadium as impractical in terms of logistics and finances. “Allowing teams to play away matches only will increase the threat of Covid-19 spread. All players should be tested,” the clubs noted.
