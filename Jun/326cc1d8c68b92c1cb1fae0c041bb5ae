Rookie rally driver Andrew Muiruri is over the moon after being cleared by World Rally Championships (WRC) officials to take part in the WRC Safari Rally that started in Nairobi with the Super Special Stage in Kasarani. Muiruri, who is in the running courtesy of Betika, said he is now raring to go as he debuts into full rallying in his Subaru Impreza N10 car, navigated by Edward Njoroge. The WRC Safari Rally, which is making a return to the WRC calendar after a 19-year absence, will also act as a leg of the Kenya National Rally Championship. “Contrary to what people are saying out there, Team Betika members will all be participating in the rally. We just had a slight problem with our roll cages during scrutineering, but all is well and we are back in action. We are keen to score points in the KNRC,” Muiruri, a mentee of legendary rally driver Patrick Njiru, said. He added: “I have prepared well and I can’t wait to make my debut in rallying. I bought the car from McRae Kimathi and replaced the fuel tank to match the FIA expectations. I also replaced the clutch plates.” Muiruri who is a mechanic with a garage in Kasarani, has been competing in tarmac racing and 4x4 competitions before upgrading to rallying.
