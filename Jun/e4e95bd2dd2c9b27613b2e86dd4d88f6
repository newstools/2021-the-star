The body of the former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile arrived at Yiiya ya Maimu, Makueni County, on Friday for interment. ODM leader Raila Odinga, Wiper leader Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka , Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, Makueni Deputy Governor Adelina Mwau, Woman Representative Rose Museo, Kibwezi West MP Patrick Musimba and Kibwezi East MP Jessica Mbalu were among politicians who attended the burial. Ndile died at Nairobi Hospital on May 30 after struggling with liver cirrhosis. Ndile was born in Western Uganda in 1964 from where he got the Kalembe nickname. He said his famous name Kalembe was a nickname picked from the Kalembe mines. Having been brought up under such dire conditions, Kalembe cultivated a burning desire to fight for the rights of fellow squatters, who incidentally are the majority in Kibwezi constituency. The ex-MP would be remembered for his humour and comical remarks that left people in stitches. The ex-legislators theatrics had positioned him as an influential politician, earning him a slot in retired President Kibaki's Cabinet as an assistant minister. Kalembe was handed the ministry of Wildlife as an assistant minister during the reign of the Narc government, giving him an opportunity to tour the country as a senior government official.
