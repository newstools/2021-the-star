Sugarcane farmers had nothing to celebrate on Madaraka Day as the sector is in shambles. They are crushed after President Uhuru Kenyatta failed to address their problems of back pay, rundown sugar mills and imports while in Kisumu for three days. They said on Wednesday they had a lot of expectations but none was met during his visit. He nothing about their problems during his Madaraka Day speech. The President launched or commissioned numerous development projects. Speaking to the Star, Kenya Sugarcane Growers Association secretary general Richard Ogendo said the four companies — Nzoia, Sony, Muhoroni and Chemelil— owe farmers more than Sh1 billion and the debt is mounting. Ogendo said sugar mills are dilapidated and need money to refurbish or replace their machinery. “We expected the President and his host, former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, to address these issues, as farmers' children are home due to non-payment of school fees,” he said. “Our dignity has been stripped from us and  we have nothing to celebrate on this Madaraka day or even the presidential visit.” Ogendo said the issue of sugar imports that have damaged the sector has not been tackled. He said farmers wanted a clear roadmap on the import issues. The secretary general said they expected the President to give an executive order on revival of the sugar sector. “As you are aware, the Sugar Bill is still stuck in a parliamentary committee despite being brought to the house in 2019," he said. “We have Tea Bill, Coffee Bill and BBI Bill that came and passed but the Sugar Bill is still stuck.” Edited by Kiilu Damaris
