Traders at Ukunda showground are decrying low business due to the poor working environment. The county government of Kwale temporarily relocated the traders from the Ibiza market to the showground to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Others were moved to pave the way for the construction of a road. Vendor Raphael Muli said the county poorly planned the relocation exercise, saying it didn’t consider all the factors that promote trade. Muli said the area is hidden, a factor that has made them lose potential customers to hawkers along the highway. “Walking all the way to this place is tiresome and customers opt to do shopping outside this market,” he said. The traders said they have continued to incur losses for lack of customers. Muli said some of their colleagues have returned to Ibiza giving them unfair competition. Along the Ukunda-Lunga-Lunga road business is slowly resuming normalcy. Some mitumba and fresh vegetable vendors have reoccupied their business spaces. Fruit seller Lena Kitungi said the county government has sidelined them. Kitungi said they lack proper operating sheds that inconvenience business activities during harsh climatic conditions. Currently, they are using umbrellas and nylons to cover themselves from the scorching sun and rainwater. She said the umbrellas and nylons require frequent replacement as they get worn out quickly. Since last month, rain has been pouring in some parts of the county. Sebastian Juma said the Kwale government should at least try to contain the hawkers in one area or take small-scale traders back to Ibiza market. Last Month the Calypso market vendors also called on the county government to fas tht-track the construction of the new marketplace in Ukunda.
