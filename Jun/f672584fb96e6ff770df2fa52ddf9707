Tiwi residents are fearful after an electrified fence was  put up by a private developer at Mbela farm in Kwale county. The fence borders people’s homes and learning institution and residents say they fear for their lives. Led by their chairman, Rashid Mwamtuku, they demanded it be removed immediately. “We have schoolchildren playing around this area and some can’t read the danger sign placed on it,” he said. Five people are alleged to have been electrocuted. In January, hundreds of villagers were left homeless after they were forcefully evicted by the private developer from the disputed Mbela farm. Their houses were reduced to rubble  by bulldozers that descended in the night. A court order to stop the eviction was later issued after residents sought protection from the government. Mwamtuku alleged  the private developer has since then violated the court order and went further to fence the area enclosing the remaining villagers. He said the move has inconvenienced and endangered the residents and children whose activities are outside the demarcated area. “People are confused on how they will manoeuvre with all entrance points encircled by an electrified fence,” he said. The residents are  calling the county government to intervene. Ann Muthoka said the fenced area could soon turn into a killing zone if  measures are not taken quickly. She said they deserve better and can’t be treated like wild animals. Human Rights Agenda organisation has threatened to go to the streets for major protests if the dispute is not resolved soon,. HURIA officer Mwinyihaji Chamosi said they are following up on the case to make sure justice prevails. (Edited by V. Graham)
