A lobby group has asked a court to scrap the law that demands all aspirants in the 2022 General Election to hold a university degree. Sheria Mtaani and Shadrack Wambui argue that the law is discriminatory and unfair to the MCA aspirants. Through lawyer Danstan Omari, the lobby group says the aspirants for the 2022 General Election, particularly for the seat of MCA who don't have degrees, have had their plans put in disarray. Omari said the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the academic year 2020 and slowed many Kenyans who had hoped to graduate with a university degree by 2022. He argues that the pandemic was never within the contemplation of the Legislature when the section of the law was enacted. Sheria Mtaani argues that failure of most persons to achieve a university degree in the current Kenyan context is a result of the high poverty levels. They also say the law has a flawed assumption that persons possessing a university degree become better leaders. "In any event, elected leaders have the liberty of employing persons with special skills to help them fulfil their agenda or purpose in office," they argue. In their court documents, the lobby says the Constitution provides for recall clauses for citizens to remove their leaders should their elected leaders fail the leadership test. They say the provision offers Kenyans an opportunity to experiment and choose persons of their liking regardless of their academic qualifications.  (edited by o. owino)
