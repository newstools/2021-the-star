Allies of Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa have launched a new political party, the Democratic Action Party of Kenya DAP–K. The move is likely to test the quest for unity among  political parties and leaders in Western. Political observers say the party could be intended to help Eugene reenter elective politics. It was approved by the Registrar of Political Parties. Its symbol is a fertiliser container and the slogan Mwamko Mpya, meaning New Dawn. DAP is one of the world's most popular fertilisers, Diammonium phosphate. The registered officials are all close Wamalwa allies. They include chairman David Muchele, secretary general Ben Masanja and treasurer Beatrice Mbingi. The party is headquartered in Webuye, Bungoma county. Masanaja told a press conference on Tuesday the party seeks to rise to national leadership by accommodating all those dissatisfied with other parties. “DAP-K seeks to offer an alternative to Kenyans who have been treated unjustly by other political parties,” he said. He said, however, the party does not seek to fight any party in Western, including Moses Wetang’ula's Ford-Kenya and Musalia Mudavadi's ANC. Ford Kenya, ANC and ODM parties are the most dominant in the region. “Though the origin is Western region, we will ensure we have a national outlook by doing a national recruitment," Masanjala said. “The launch of the party is a clear indication Devolution CS Wamalwa is aligning himself to come for elective politics," analyst Isaac Wanjekeche  said. He said DAP will face major resistance from Ford-Kenya, ANC and DP William Ruto's UDA party. Formation of the party associated with Wamalwa deals a blow to the quest for Luhya unity that has been advanced by Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula and Mudavadi, he said. The two have been working together to unite the Mulembe nation. (Edited by V. Graham)
