Vihiga Queens coach Alex Alumira has urged his players to focus on winning the Football Kenya Federation Women's Cup as well as the Cecafa Champions League qualifiers. The three-time champions missed the opportunity to win the Kenya Women's Premier League title for the fourth consecutive time falling to Gaspo in post-match penalties after a 1-1 all draw in regulation time. The Vihiga-based will represent hosts Kenya in the qualifiers between July 17 and August 1 in Nairobi with the opportunity to grace the continental's newest competition in November. The FKF Women's Cup in August is another platform the team is looking at in their quest to end the season with silverware. Although Alumira admits defeat to Gaspo was heartbreaking, he says all is not lost. "Obviously, we were disappointed but at the same time, players have to get this off their backs. What matters is how we are going to tackle our opponents in Cecafa," said Alumira. "Winning the regional tournament will be the best way to announce our arrival to Africa's premier competition. There's still the prospect of bagging the FKF Cup so hard work begins now." Kenya will battle it out with Tanzania, South Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, Rwanda, Burundi and Zanzibar for the sole slot. Alumira said they are studying their opponents keenly in order to have an idea of how they can counter them. "We are keenly mastering their tactics so that by the time the competition serves off, we will have known how to deal with all of them," he said. Ethiopia's Nigd Bank will be one of the teams that will worry Queens. The team, bankrolled by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, won their fourth league title in April. The six winners from each zone will qualify for the tournament proper, with league champion of the host country and an additional team (wildcard) making up the final eight. The eight teams will be divided into two groups of four with the top two teams from each group making it to the semis.
