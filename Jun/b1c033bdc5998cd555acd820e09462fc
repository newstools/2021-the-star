Former Sports CS Rashid Echesa's fake arms deal case will now be heard in camera for security reasons. The hearings started on Monday this week and were scheduled to proceed on Tuesday but the prosecution asked the court to allow two witnesses to be heard in camera. Senior principal magistrate Kenneth Cheruiyot was informed that two witnesses from the Department of Defence have classified information. The defense lawyers did not object to the application by the prosecution, telling the court that they were ready to proceed in camera. In a short ruling, Cheruiyot allowed the application and ruled that only the accused, their lawyers and prosecution will be allowed in court when the two will be giving their testimony. On Monday, the court heard that Echesa never met Deputy President William Ruto at Harambee Annex on the day he was arrested in connection with the Sh39.5 billion fake arms deal. Witnesses who testified on Monday told senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot that Ruto was not in his Harambee Annex office at the time. Echesa has been charged with conspiracy to commit a felony. He is accused of conspiring to make a document with intent to defraud in the multibillion-shilling fake arms deal. The former CS has been charged alongside Daniel Omondi alias General Juma, Clifford Onyango and Kennedy Mboya with six counts of making a false document. They are also alleged to have obtained Sh11.5 million from Kozlowski Stanley Bruno by purporting that they would award him a tender to supply military equipment. Edited by Henry Makori
