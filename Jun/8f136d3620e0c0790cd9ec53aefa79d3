The Prisons Department and Kenya Red Cross have raised concerns over a rise in depression among inmates in penal institutions. The agencies attribute the development to the suspension of visits to inmates following the outbreak of Covid-19 last year. KRC deputy secretary general Annette Msabeni said mental healthcare was currently a major challenge in the country’s prisons. She said that KRC had embarked on countrywide counselling sessions for all the inmates in the 129 prisons, targeting those undergoing depression. “Some of these are parents who have been following the welfare of their families through the visits, which were suspended a year ago due to the pandemic,” she said. To address this, Msabeni said that they had issued mobile phones and donated credit to the Prison Department to assist the inmates reach out to their kin. Speaking during a meeting with the Prisons Department, she said the counselling targeted both the inmates and staff members. “We also have a toll-free number for all those people suffering from depression and this has been instrumental following the pandemic that has affected hundreds,” she said. The deputy commissioner general of prisons Florence Omondi admitted that mental healthcare was an issue in the penal institutions. She noted that the affected inmates were moody and claimed to be sick, but on examination they were found to be medically fit. “The outbreak of Covid-19 led to lockdown in prisons, forcing us to cancel all visits and this has contributed to the current mental health crisis,” she said. Omondi termed the support by KRC as very crucial in linking the inmates with relatives during the current pandemic. “We have recorded a change in the mood of inmates in the prison with many undergoing stress and this is mainly due to the cancellation of prison visits,” she said. Interior CAS Winnie Guchu said that plans were on the way to reintroduce visits. Edited by Henry Makori
