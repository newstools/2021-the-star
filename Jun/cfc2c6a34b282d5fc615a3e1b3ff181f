Umoja 2 MCA has been charged with assaulting a businessman. MCA Joseph Ouma Ndonji was accused of assaulting Jared Ouma Aruwa by kicking and punching him on May 30, 2019, at Kwa Miti along Manyanja Road in Tena Estate. The MCA was arrested on November 21, 2019 and has been out on Sh5,000 police cash bail. The complainant reported that he was walking to a hardware shop along Manyanja Road to buy paint at around 11am when the MCA, who was inside a vehicle, called out his name. He said the MCA angrily asked him why he was frustrating his development projects by destroying electric poles that he had put up. Aruwa said he denied vandalising the electric poles, but Ndonji grabbed him by the shoulders and started kicking him. He said the MCA forced him to admit that he was behind the destruction of the poles. The 53-year-old man told the police that the MCA hit him on the shoulder, after which his driver joined in and held him by the neck, claiming that he (Aruwa) wanted to beat up his boss. Aruwa said a group of people joined them and rained kicks and blows on him. While he was on the ground, he heard the MCA telling the people who were beating him to let him be, as he had gotten enough discipline. He said his mobile phone was stolen during the incident. The MCA denied the allegations when the charges were read to him before Makadara senior principal magistrate Stephen Jalang’o on Thursday. He told the court he had spoken with the complainant, who had agreed to withdraw the case. Jalang’o granted the application and allowed the matter to be withdrawn.
