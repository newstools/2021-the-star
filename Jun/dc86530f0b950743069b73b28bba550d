Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has admitted a serious shortage of oxygen in hospitals in the county. The governor, however, denied reports  residents are now asked to source oxygen cylinders for their sick relatives as reported in a section of the press. “Yes there’s a shortage of oxygen but it’s not only in Kakamega but the entire Lake Region counties. We have not reached the point of asking patients to bring their own cylinders. Where will they get them?” he asked. Oparanya said the shortage of oxygen is the reason governors from the Lake Region Economic Bloc met last Friday in Kisumu to review containment measures. He said the county’s oxygen plant producing 320 litres a minute was not enough to meet the high demand by Covid-19 patients admitted to the county general hospital from other counties. They share beds within the bloc. “The shortage of oxygen in Kakamega will be a thing of the past in coming weeks once we instal the new oxygen plant we acquired recently,” he said. “The plant, which has already left the Port of Mombasa, can produce of 1,000 liters of oxygen per minute." The plant will sell oxygen to other counties in the region, but other counties are encouraged to buy their own and be self-sufficient. Sources within the hospital told the Star that most of the Covid-19 patients in the county came from neighbouring Kisumu and Siaya counties. The government declared the 14 counties in the lake region a hotspot for the Delta strain of Covid-19 following a surge in infection on June 18. The curfew was extended from 10pm to 4am; public gatherings and church services banned for 30 days. The regional bloc has formed a committee of eminent persons to monitor implementation of the strengthened protocols. (Edited by V. Graham)
