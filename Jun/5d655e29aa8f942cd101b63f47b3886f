Residents of Faza in Lamu East want the government to expand the only footbridge to the island as it is too narrow and endangers lives. The foot bridge measures about 500 metres in length and just about 2.5 metres in width. Many users of the Faza footbridge have fallen off and plunged to their deaths in the Indian Ocean. The bridge built two decades ago is the only access route for the over 3,000 Faza residents, most of whom are fishermen. “It's been over 10 years of complaining over the state of this bridge but nothing is being done yet people continue to lose their lives,” said Faza elder Sharif Yusuf. It has become a suicidal affair for vehicles, motorbikes, donkeys and people to navigate the bridge as chances of falling over are high. Early last month, a boda boda pillion passenger died after falling off a motorcycle and plunging into the ocean as the rider attempted to avoid hitting a donkey  while crossing the bridge. Residents also complained, saying a lot of time wasted crossing the bridge as people have to take turns walking across. “Only one person at a time can cross on the bridge and while at it, you can’t run. Motorbikes and vehicles can’t overtake. It needs to be expanded,” said elder Fahad Hamisi. At least five people have fallen off the bridge and died between January and June this year. Scores of others continue to nurse injuries sustained from such falls and accidents on the bridge. In 2015, a motorcyclist died on the spot after he fell into the ocean while attempting to avoid hitting a donkey on the bridge. In November 2016, seven AP officers and two civilians narrowly escaped death after their land cruiser slid off the bridge and plunged into the Indian Ocean. -Edited by SKanyara
