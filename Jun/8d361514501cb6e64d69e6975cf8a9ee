Six people were killed in Isiolo by armed bandits suspected to be from the neighbouring Wajir county. The bandits killed three women, two men and a child in a dawn attack in Mado Wale village, Bassa location, Merti subcounty. They then vandalised a borehole. Isiolo county commissioner Herman Shambi said police had been dispatched to the affected areas to pursue and apprehend the bandits. The attackers did not steal animals but killed and fled. Isiolo Governor Muhammed Kuti condemned the incident and urged security agencies to get to the bottom of the matter and bring the assailants to justice. The raiders' motive had yet to be established, but Kuti said they seek to create fear and displace local pastoralists from their land following the boundary disputes. "We call on the government to move with speed and arrest the suspects before this matter goes out of hand," Kuti said in a phone interview. He said the boundary dispute between Isiolo and Northeastern must be resolved to end attacks and counterattacks.
