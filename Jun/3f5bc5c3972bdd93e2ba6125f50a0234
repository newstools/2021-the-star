A guard on Sunday slashed two youths in Mai Mahiu, Naivasha, killing one before members of the public lynched him an hour later. During the midday incident near Jikaze IDP camp, one person was left fighting for his life following a clash between the guard and a group of youths. The guard engaged in a heated argument with the youths over employment at a construction site before attacking them with a panga. Fred Waithaka, an eyewitness, said the argument degenerated into name-calling before the guard whipped out a machete. He slashed two of the youths as the others fled before retreating to the site off the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road. “One of the youths died before he could be taken to hospital, while the other was left nursing serious hand and stomach injuries,” he said. Irate residents later ganged up and beat the guard to death as police moved in to contain the situation. The bodies were taken to a mortuary and the officers initiated investigations. Naivasha police division boss Samuel Waweru said the bodies had been collected and an inquest file opened. “A fight between some youths led to the death of two of them, while a third was admitted to hospital in critical condition,” Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said. Meanwhile, police in Naivasha have arrested a suspect said to be behind the spate of rape incidents on some of the estates. The man nicknamed Machete was arrested on Karai estate following a tipoff by members of the public. Residents said he has been terrorising for more than six months. Residents later flocked to Karai police post where he was detained and tried to lynch him, prompting the officers to lob teargas. OCPD Waweru said they recovered assorted items, some of which belonged to those he had robbed. “We have recovered a toy pistol, mobile phones and a bloodied machete among other items and five victims have so far identified him,” he said.
