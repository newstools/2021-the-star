Harambee Stars’ shot-stopper, Patrick Matasi heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday after well-wishers including international teammate Michael Olunga and sports betting firm Odibets came to his aid and paid off all hospital bills accrued as well as a token of Sh200,000 to cater for his family needs while convalescing. Matasi, a goalkeeper at St. George’s of Ethiopia, suffered facial injuries after the car he was travelling in was involved in an accident at Lessos area in Uasin Gishu as he was heading home. His son and wife also suffered injuries with the baby only being discharged on Thursday. Matasi family's total bill had reached Sh429,812. "I am very grateful to Olunga and Odibets for coming through for me at this hour of need. I am also grateful to the doctors at Kakamega hospital for the care they have given us despite the financial challenges we had. I am also thankful to all well-wishers who kept us in their prayers. It is by God's mercy that my family and I are alive and hopefully we will put this traumatizing period behind us and continue the healing process,” said Matasi. Olunga, who played with Matasi at the African Cup of Nations in Egypt, said he could not standby and watch a friend and a brother go through the trauma of seeing his child in hospital due to financial difficulties. Odibets brand ambassador Fred Arocho revealed they had learned about Matasi's predicament on social media and decided to prevail upon Odibets to arrange a rescue package for the Kenyan international. "It is disheartening to see someone who has worn the national colours with distinction suffering. I am grateful Odibets and Olunga have shown compassion towards a national hero like Matasi, “ said Arocho. Aggrey Sayi, Odibets marketing manager, added that the firm also undertook to clear the hospital bills for twenty other patients who had been discharged and were struggling to pay off their bills.
