The Orange Democratic Movement has waived party membership registration fees for the next three months. Secretary General, Edwin Sifuna said this came about after many people asked the party to waive the Sh100 required for ordinary membership registration due to the current economic situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. "The Party Leader HE. Hon. Raila Amolo Odinga has directed my office to waive the membership fee for anyone wishing to join our party in the next three months beginning 1st July, 2021," Sifuna said in a letter to all County Chairpersons. He went on to say that the party has been carrying out continuous membership recruitment, and this has seen the membership increase significantly. Sifuna called on the Orange party supporters to use three-month free registration window to sign up as members of the party, which will allow them to participate in the grassroots elections and nominations. In February 2021, Sifuna said ODM Party members have until August this year to register as life members. In a statement, the scretary-general said for one to be cleared to contest for any elective position on the ODM party ticket he/she must have been a member for at least one year. "Following last Friday's meeting of the National Executive Committee-NEC, and subsequent deliberations on one's eligibility to contest for an elective position on the ODM ticket, we wish to let potential aspirants know that they have up to August this year to register for Life Membership status in the party," Sifuna said. The move is in line with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s plan to rejig the party ahead of next year's general election. The party plans to conduct grassroots elections from the polling stations to the national level, an exercise it hopes will not only strengthen its structures but will also provide fresh energy. The exercise will be undertaken at both the subcounty and county levels as well.
