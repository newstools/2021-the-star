The tight and congested Kenyan Premier League fixtures will cause players fatigue and injuries, Nairobi City Stars coach Sanjin Alagic has. “The schedule is too tight for matches and this will continue for the next two or so months. I believe players will suffer from tiredness, injuries and it will be very hard to keep a good level of performance,” said the tactician. “The negative is that we have played many games every 3-4 days in the last few weeks and the players are exhausted. We now have just four days before we play our next league match.” Alagic believes it’s not only City Stars who will suffer. “You’ll see many surprise results in upcoming championship matches,” he summed up. Commenting on the team’s exit from the FKF Betway Cup at the hands of Bidco, the UEFA Pro License holder said: “I will look at this from two perspectives, one positive and one negative; positive is that we are in really good shape and after two wins in the league, we continued the run in the Cup with great performance,” He told the club’s official portal: “First I need to congratulate my team for a good run in making it to the quarterfinal of the Cup. We represented City Stars well. They were good and exciting matches, great experience.” Sanjin’s most immediate task is back-to-back home league games against Western Stima and Kakamega Homeboyz on June 15 and June 19, all in Ruaraka. City Stars sit ninth on the KPL log after 18 games.
