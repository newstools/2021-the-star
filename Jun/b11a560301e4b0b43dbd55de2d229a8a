The Vihiga government has rolled out a programme to vaccinate more than 40,000 animals against foot and mouth disease. Governor Wilber Ottichilo said his government is committed to promoting good agricultural practices to increase farmers' income. "So far, we have vaccinated over 25,000 livestock including cattle, pigs and goats," the governor said in Khwiliba, Luanda subcounty. Ottichilo said the Agriculture department has set aside Sh8 million for vaccines in the next financial year. "We are committed to easing the burden of vaccination from farmers. We are going to walk with our farmers to ensure they have access to knowledge on vaccination,‚Äù he said. Ottichilo said Sabatia and Hamisi subcounties are the worst-hit by the disease. County director of veterinary services Darlingtone Kadenge said foot and mouth disease spreads fast. "It is for this reason we are targeting 40,000 livestock for vaccination against foot and mouth disease," he said. In 2019, the county government ordered the closure of livestock markets for three months due to the disease. The county government also intends to vaccinate 60,000 cattle against lumpy skin disease in September 2021. Kadenge said money has been allocated to procure 60,000 doses. Since Governor Ottichilo assumed office in August 2017, he has revived the Mwitoko Fish and Aquaculture Training centre and funded farmer groups through the National Agricultural Rural Inclusive Growth Project. The county has also established Serem and Mukhakhala slaughterhouses in Hamisi and Luanda respectively. Edited by A.N
