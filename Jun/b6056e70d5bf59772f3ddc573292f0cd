Kenyans have for far too long blamed politicians, sometimes rightfully, for all their woes. As citizens, we must realise that our health and well being is our responsibility. Adults of sound mind are capable of weighing the pros and cons of attending a political rally with the pandemic ravaging our land and talk of a fourth wave being rife. It makes no sense to attend a political gathering, now considered super-spreader event, then lament that politicians are defying Covid-19 protocols. Without the public foolishly trooping to such meetings, the politician would have no one to address. Politicians are a selfish lot and it is not inconceivable that they have not received two jabs by the time they venture out for a public meeting. But the throngs hanging on the politicians every word and hoping for handouts are their own worst enemies. The buck stops with Kenyans. It is time they put their well being first and say no to super-spreader events. Such meetings are almost always shadowed by a surge of Covid-19 infections and stringent curfew follows. The lockdowns affect the livelihoods of the very public that cheered politicians at a rally. Whichever way, the common man gets the short end of the stick. The police must put an end to the wanton breach of Covid-19 containment measures by politicians and make arrests. Without the police taking action and the public paying no attention to the politicians, shall we get out this perilous predicament?
