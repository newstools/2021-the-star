Candidates who sat in the 2020 KCPE exams will report to secondary schools on August 2. Education CS George Magoha made the announcement on Tuesday while releasing the Form One selection exercise. In the placement, national schools will admit 36,254 students out of which 17,406 girls and 18,848 boys. In this yearâ€™s placement exercise 36,254 candidates will join national schools, 1,827 will join special needs schools and 201,077 will join Extra County schools. Also, 213,591 will join County schools and 718,516 will join sub-county schools. This will be the third cohort of students to be admitted under the 100 per cent policy with the exclusion of inmates, overage candidates and those in refuge camps. Magoha said the Education ministry will work with the Interior ministry to see that all candidates who sat the 2020 KCPE exams will all join secondary schools. He said ministry officials will be required to file accurate reports on admission progress. Magoha further warned principals from turning away students during the admission exercise due to lack of fees but also asked parents to honour their responsibility of paying their dues. He asked parents to pay the amount prescribed by the ministry. "Any other charges are illegal," he said However, the CS says the candidates do not get proper guidance in the selection of schools. "Poor selection guidance made many of the candidates miss their preferred selection," Magoha said. He called on headteachers and parents to help learners in the selection process as the competition for top schools was competitive.
