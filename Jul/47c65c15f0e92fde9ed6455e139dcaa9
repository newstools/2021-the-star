Singer Bahati has asked his baby mama Yvette Obura to forgive him for hiding his daughter Mueni from the public for close to two years. In a long post on Instagram, the father of four said he was afraid of being judged by society. "Your birth was one of my happiest moments but yet a tough one for me since I was at my peak as a gospel artiste then," he said. Bahati added that he got Yvette pregnant after being awarded as the Male Artiste of the Year Groove Awards and Afrimma's Best Gospel Act in Africa. "I was judged and ended up being a hypocrite by not accepting my blood. This is another opportunity to ask for forgiveness from the Mum and my daughter for keeping you as a secret and away from the public for almost two years," he said. "It is not what I wished for but because of what I lived for, Gospel Music, which should have not been the case; it's not Godly to be a pretender." He then thanked his daughter for giving him the dad title. "And to you, Mama Mueni Yvette, thank you for choosing peace above and creating a conducive environment as we both raise this beautiful princess @Mueni_Bahati." He commended Yvette for making it easy to co-parent. "Your relationship with my wife Diana and the positivity that both of you portray is not only an inspiration to many families out there but also to me." He wished Yvette well in her next relationship and requested to be invited to her wedding. On seeing the post, Yvette said she already forgave him for the sake of their daughter.
