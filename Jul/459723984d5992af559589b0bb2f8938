The Jubilee candidate in the Kiambaa by-election Kariri Njama has exuded confidence that he will emerge the winner in today's poll. Speaking moments after casting his vote at Gacii Primary School, Njama expressed confidence with the exercise which started early morning Thursday. "We are confident that this is our win. We have done that with a lot of prayers, talking to our people and the support of our President and Jubilee party," Kariri said. He noted that his win will be a statement that the ruling party led by President Uhuru Kenyatta still holds sway in Mt Kenya and the country at large. "We are going to take this as an opportunity to ensure that Jubilee remains the party of the people of Kenya," he said. He was accompanied by Kieni MP Kanini Kega and Muranga MP Sabina Chege. Kega waded into an earlier incident where National Assembly Majority Leader Amos Kimunya was confronted by youths on claims that he was not a voter or an agent at the Constituency. The MP said that UDA had sensed defeat and have resorted to causing chaos in Jubilee's strongholds. "Nothing stops any person from being an agent. It is unfortunate what we saw where Majority Leader was being harassed," Kega said. "They want to cause mayhem in our strongholds. They have sensed defeat...we know the will of the Kiambaa people will prevail." Sabina appealed to residents to turn up in big numbers and vote for the Jubilee candidate. "We thank God, we have prayed and we trust God this victory belongs to Kariri Njama," she said.
