Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati and assembly speaker Emmanuel Situma are engaged in a war of words on who should be blamed for the cash crisis in the county. Bungoma government staff have not been paid for two months. While Wangamati blames Situma for failing to be a neutral arbiter and sabotaging him through the assembly, the speaker is accusing the governor of failing to follow the law. Speaking during a talk show on a vernacular station, Wangamati castigated Situma for siding with a section of MCAs and fighting him. The governor dismissed as petty last week's move by the speaker to petition the Senate over the cash stalemate. Last week, the two appeared before a Senate team after the assembly claimed that Wangamati had refused to hand over money for operations at the county assembly. The speaker said the stalemate had caused activities at the assembly to stall and service providers had not been paid. This, he said, has led to the closure of the assembly at a critical time when the House is expected to pass the budget. But Wangamati said the failure to pass the budget has made him unable to pay workers who have threatened to go on strike. Speaking to journalists in his office, Situma vowed not to reopen the assembly until Wangamati gives the assembly money for operations. “The executive has refused with the money legally meant for the assembly, yet they are blaming us for not opening the assembly. We will not open the assembly until we receive our money,” Situma said. The speaker further said the money to pay workers had been approved. “Money for salaries for May and June was already appropriated and the Controller of Budget confirmed the same. Let's be honest and pay workers their salaries,” the speaker said. Edited by A.N
