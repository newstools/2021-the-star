Malkia Strikers outside hitter Pamela Masaisai hopes playing at the delayed  Tokyo Olympic Games will help re-ignite her career after coming through a difficult period. The 24-year old has been plagued by injuries — even missing the Olympic qualifiers in Cameroon with a shoulder sprain. Sickness and a lack of adequate playing time at club level has not done the athlete any good despite being described as one of the best prospects to come through Kwanthanze's production line. Masaisai, the Most Valuable Player at the 2019 Amaco tournament, is keeping her fingers crossed — believing this is her time to lead Kenya's medal hunt when Malkia Strikers play hosts Japan in their first match on Sunday. The Nandi-born athlete will battle for a slot in the starting line-up with Mercy Moim, Noel Murambi and Leonida Kasaya. She hopes to stay healthy and injury-free in order to repay the faith shown in her by the coaches after being recalled for Olympics duty. "It has gone so well since we arrived in Kurume. I hope to remain fit and that nothing bad will befell me in Tokyo. I have had a recurrence of the injury for the past eight years but it is behind me now. I feel good and confident and I can't wait to wipe the slate clean and start again," she said. "I have had insufficient playing time at Kenya Prisons due to competition for places. This is the perfect chance for me to get my career back on track  and prove that I can thrive at the highest level while restoring the confidence shown in me by the coaches." Masaisai pulled out of the Olympic qualifiers after aggravating her injury and missing the 2019 Kenya Volleyball Federation League playoffs. The fourth-born in a family of six participated in the intercontinental qualifiers in Italy two years ago but did so under medication due to a stomachache. Masaisai would have turned pro in 2018 but Kenya Prisons turned down advances from a Tunisian club. Her dreams of playing professionally, however, are still valid.
