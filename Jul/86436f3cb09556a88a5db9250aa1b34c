Systems at four city courts are set to be digitised and renovated this year as the Nairobi County Government is set to spend Sh35.9 million to streamline the operations. This part of the Sh597.3 million Financial Year 2021-22 budget allocated to City Hall's legal sub-sector for enhancing operation in the legal department. The developments are contained in Nairobi County’s Fiscal Strategy Paper for the current financial year. For the renovations of the four courts and city court registry, City hall will spend Sh10 million. Most of the city courts handle cases of residents who have gone against the by-laws of the county government. Each of the 47 counties has by-laws based on their needs as it offers services to the residents. A by-law is a regulation made by the county government or corporation for the management of its affairs. The courts handle at least 40 cases daily as they operate manually despite other courts going digital. In order to reduce manual labour of paperwork in the courts, Sh15 million has been set aside to purchase an automated legal case management system. “As part of development priorities for the legal sub-sector, a total of Sh15 million has been set aside for the procurement of automated legal case management system,” reads the document in part. A legal document management platform allows operations of the court to be fully automated by offering a digital platform that includes security, accessibility and storage. The platform enables the generation of automated reports, billing, and invoicing as well as enabling access to the records, and the associated legal matter anywhere anytime. It also provides proper storage to reduce paperwork with the help of metadata and tagging, managing and tracking. Also, Sh7.6 million will also be used to purchase a motor vehicle for use by the legal sub-sector while Sh4 million has been allocated to renovate the 12th floor of City Hall Annex hosting most operations of the sub-sector.
