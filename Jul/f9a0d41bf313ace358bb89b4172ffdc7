President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s niece and KICC chief executive Nana Gecaga is celebrating 22 years of recovering from being an alcoholic. She says this is one of the most important milestones in her life. Nana, who has been vocal about how alcoholism ruined her life, says she is proud of herself as she has remained committed to sobriety. She wrote on Instagram, "22 years of being sober. I just want to thank everyone who has played a role in supporting me to get this far. Lastly, I want to thank me, myself and I. I have to give credit where it is due. "I've remained committed to my sobriety, I've put it first always and been very proud of where I have come and where I'm going. It takes courage to go against the grain and it takes humility to not only realise you have a problem but then commit the entire rest of your life to change it for the better." In a past interview, Nana admitted that she used to drink up to a crate of beer and a bottle of hard liquor in one sitting. Her love for alcohol blew up some of her dreams, one of which was to become an athlete. Nana took the step to take it slow at the age of 21 after living in the UK for over a decade. She added that the bold move did not come short of challenges, revealing that she lost friends. "The one thing I can say to them is, tomorrow is another day and try to live or get to that day and never be ashamed or too proud to ask for support. Kenya has a lot of support and use it."
