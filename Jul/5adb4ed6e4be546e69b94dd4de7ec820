Police in Nanyuki town on Tuesday arrested two suspects accused of conning people unknown amount of money in Western Kenya. Outgoing Laikipia county criminal investigations officer Francis Wanjau said two other suspects fled but police officers were pursuing them. Wanjau said the four had been trailed from Lugari in Western where they were defrauding people on the guise that they would install communications masts on their lands. “They were lying to people that they worked with one of the telecommunications company in the country and would get residents personal details and use this to defraud them,” said Wanjau. Police officers from Nanyuki police station laid a trap and intercepted the vehicle they were using near Unison Sacco along Nanyuki-Nyeri road. Wanjau said the officers had to shoot at one of the tyres of the vehicle and deflated it after the driver of the vehicle failed to stop upon being flagged down. “We found numerous SIM cards and mobile phones among other things used to defraud people in the vehicle and in the clothes they wore. We are investigating them so that we can take them to court,” he said. The two are held at Nanyuki police station while the vehicle was also towed to the same station. -Edited by SKanyara
