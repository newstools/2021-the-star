Some Garissa MCAs have criticised Chief Kadhi Sheikh Ahmed Muhdhar's decision-making around key Muslim celebrations. Minority leader Mohamed Ali said the Chief Kadhi has consistently gone against the wishes of the faithful on important occasions. “It’s very unfortunate what the Chief Kadhi in this country is doing. If you are a leader, you are leading the people who are under you. Every time the Muslim community want to celebrate on their occasions, he goes against them,” Ali said. “The last time, it was on Idd-ul-Fitr and even today, 99 per cent of Muslims are celebrating Idd ul Adha but the Chief Kadhi yesterday [Monday] told Muslims to celebrate on Wednesday which is even against the teaching of Islam,” he added. The MCA spoke on Tuesday at General Mohamud Idd grounds after Idd ul Adha prayers. Goreale MCA Abdirahman Mohamed said the Chief Kadhi is not the custodian of the Muslim festivals' calendar. Mohamed said the association of Muslim leaders in Kenya are the custodians of the calendar. He urged the government to consult the association for actual celebration days for official placement on the Kenya gazette. “The Chief Kahi's role is limited. It is only about inheritance and marriage. He cannot interfere with the calendar of the Muslims and therefore he should restrict himself to the roles of the office he is holding,” Mohamed said. Chief Kadhi Muhdhar had said Monday the holy celebrations would be marked on Wednesday. "No moon was sighted by Saturday, July 10. Therefore, the fasting starts on Monday, July, 12 and the holy celebrations will be marked on Wednesday, July 21," he said. On May 13, a section of Muslims defied the Chief Kadhi to hold Idd-ul-Fitr prayers a day earlier than advised.
