The IEBC has denied aiding rigging in the ongoing Kiambaa by-election following allegations made by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria. In a statement on Thursday, the electoral agency said claims by Kuria that some officials had sneaked out to conduct voting at growers plantation were false. "The car in question is an IEBC vehicle being used by Commission staff who are providing technical support to the polling process. The post by Moses Kuria is therefore a false allegation. #July15thByelections," IEBC said in a tweet. Kuria had on earlier on Thursday shared pictures of a vehicle on his social media pages alleging that IEBC officials had sneaked out KIEMS kits using the vehicle. He noted that he could not reach IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and that was the reason he opted to share the information on social media. "Dear Wafula Chebukati. You are not picking my phones. IEBC clerks from Kingothua Primary School have sneaked our KIEMS kits and conducting voting at valentine growers plantation. This is the vehicle ferrying them. Call me back," Kuria wrote. Kuria is backing UDA candidate Njuguna Wanjiku after agreeing to withdraw his party - PEP's - candidate from the race. Meanwhile, Jubilee candidate in the by-election Kariri Njama exuded confidence that he will emerge the winner in the poll. Speaking moments after casting his vote at Gacii Primary School, Njama expressed confidence with the exercise. "We are confident that this is our win. We have done that with a lot of prayers, talking to our people and the support of our President and Jubilee party," Kariri said. He noted that his win will be a statement that the ruling party led by President Uhuru Kenyatta still holds sway in Mt Kenya and the country at large.
