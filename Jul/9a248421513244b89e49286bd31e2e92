A threat by traders in Kandwia market in Kyuso subcounty to lynch and 'necklace' criminals has shocked the police into action. Eleven suspected thugs were arrested by police shortly after traders visited the DCC and threatened vigilante justice to rid the area of crime because police were doing nothing. About 120 traders on Wednesday visited the office of Kyuso deputy county commissioner, Reuben Kimosop and complained about skyrocketing cases of stealing, burglaries and muggings. Although Kimosop was out of office, the delegation led by Josephat Mutinda handed a protest letter and crime memorandum to assistant county commissioner Eunice Mbithe. Joined by subcounty police chief Beatrice Nduku, they promised action. Mutinda told Mbithe traders have reached the point where they were considered lynching and necklacing suspected criminals and bhang smokers . He said police have turned a deaf ear whenever crimes were reported to them. The Kandwia business community had resolved to use people power and sanitise the market centre of crime committed by well-known criminals. Mutinda presented a six-pager memorandum of grievances containing the names of 14 suspected criminals on the people's 'most wanted' list. He said the marked individuals were at  risk of being lynched unless they were arrested to face the law. Kimosop told the Star on Thursday a police operation was carried out  on Wednesday night and at least 11 people were arrested. “All 11 suspects are to appear to appear in court Thursday. We had to swing into action as we could not take the traders' grievances and their list of suspects lightly," the DCC said. (Edited by V. Graham)
