Kenya will send seven teams to the East and Central Africa Handball Championship in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in November. According to the regional body secretary Charles Omondi, there will be four men’s and three women’s sides for the November 28 December 6 show. The Kenyan teams headed to the tournament include reigning champions Nairobi Water, National Cereals Board and KDF women sides. The men’s category will have National Cereals Board, Strathmore University, self-supporting Black Mamba and GSU. “Apart from the seven teams from Kenya, invitations have already been sent to clubs from the region and so far the response is encouraging,” said Omondi. He said APR of Rwanda, the reigning men champions will attend as well as teams from Tanzania, Zanzibar, Burundi, DR Congo, Uganda and Djibouti. “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, we were unable to have the event last year but Dar has accepted to host us and we are looking forward to a good meeting,” Omondi said. With the resumption of the national league at Nyayo Stadium, the seven teams should be able to peak at the right time going into the championship. Kigali hosted the last tournament in 2019.
