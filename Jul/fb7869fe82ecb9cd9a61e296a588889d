Alex Gitari has been appointed Kenya Airports Authority MD after serving for 23 months in interim capacity following the exit of Johnny Anderson in 2019. "It is with great pleasure that I announce the appointment of Guitar for a term of three years effective July 8, 2021,"Susan Kiama, the director of the human resource committee, said. In a statement on Thursday, Kiama said Gitari emerged the winner in an exercise that was carried per KAA act. "He has provided effective leadership and KAA in an acting position and we have confidence that he is the right candidate to guide the authority through this pandemic," Kiama said. "... and more importantly leverage the opportunities and resources that will enable the authority to emerge stronger and maintain its position."
