Nairobi residents will  be served with demand notices should they fail to pay for services rendered by City Hall. The Ann Kananu-led administration will also be conducting constant enforcement inspections to ensure compliance. The county’s finance executive Allan Igambi on June 24 during the budget reading said City Hall will provide the necessary tools for inspection, enforcement and collection of revenue. “The county will ensure prompt billing as well as create public awareness of all county levies for residents to know how much to pay, how to pay, deadlines and consequences of being in default,” he said. As part of the revenue-raising measures, the county will also introduce monthly seasonal tickets for building materials transporters. The county aims to collect Sh3.02 billion in parking, more parking areas and zonal charging of the parking bays will be gazetted. Currently, motorists pay Sh200 as a daily parking fee in the city centre. In the 2019-2020 financial year, City Hall only managed to collect Sh1.5 billion against a target of Sh2.8 billion. The county is also banking on the implementation of the Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Act, 2021, which began last month to net Sh2 billion. According to the Act, all betting, lotteries and gaming licensed under the new law will attract an entertainment tax chargeable at 20 per cent of the gross winnings of all betting, lotteries and gaming. The CEC said the new measures will help the county raise Sh19.8 billion in the new financial year of  2021-22 to fund its Sh39.6 billion budget. In FY 2019-20 City Hall collected Sh8.53 billion, which was barely half the target of Sh17.3 billion. This was attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic, with Nairobi being the epicentre. This was a drop of about Sh2 billion from the Sh10.17 billion recorded in FY 2018-19 against a target of Sh15.21 billion. As part of the new levies, land rates have been set at 0.13 per cent of the current land value in a proposed new valuation roll, in which landowners will pay more for their assets. Currently, property owners in Nairobi pay land rates at 25 per cent of the unimproved site value based on the 1980 valuation roll, which City Hall says has caused it to lose on the appreciation of plots. City Hall will also increase the number of registered businesses from the current 188,000 to approximately 500,000 through an update of single businesses. This is expected to increase revenue from single business permits to Sh5 billion from the current Sh2 billion. The county will also increase the number of rateable properties in Nairobi to 300,000 from the current 161,000 properties. This will be done through the implementation of the Geographical Information System (GIS)-based valuation. As a result,  the county government aims to collect an extra Sh3.2 billion to raise revenue from land rates to Sh6 billion from current Sh2.8 billion. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
