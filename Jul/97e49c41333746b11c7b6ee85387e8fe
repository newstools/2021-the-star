ODM leader Raila Odinga has said that many Kenyans are struggling to make ends meet, and the only way this can be remedied is by building an economy that works for all. In a statement on Wednesday, the former Prime Minister insisted that building such an economy will have to start with the promotion of small and medium enterprise businesses. He added that this is achievable by also encouraging realistic taxation and innovation. "All Kenyans have great aspirations and expectations amidst struggles to make ends meet. Our youth are struggling to clear school, secure good jobs, stop depending on parents, start families and, save for the future," Raila said. The ODM leader’s words come a few hours after he outlined his economic vision to make Kenya the African continent’s headquarters for global business. In a statement on Wednesday, Raila said he imagines a country with a firm foundation for the rule of law backed by efficient government structures that can withstand pressure. The ODM leader went on to highlight some of the things that need to be done, for this to be achieved, including; investment in manpower development through a universal top-flight public education system and enforce meritocracy when hiring them. "End result; We make Kenya Africa’s leading financial centre; a logistics, shipping and aviation hub; Africa’s headquarter for global business, manufacturing and diplomacy. Jobs come, upward social mobility comes for all. I believe it’s possible," he said. The former PM's macroeconomic vision varies somewhat from Deputy President William Ruto's bottom-up approach which focuses on the microeconomic aspect.
