Growing trees is the only way to fight the adverse effects of climate change. Let's appreciate the concern from corporates in Kenya, which are working with other organisations to help in planting more trees. While Kenya is aiming for 10 per cent forest cover, Gabon is walking the talk as her forests cover stands at 88 per cent of the country. The forests are home to unique wildlife, including 60 per cent of the world’s remaining forest elephants. The trees absorb a total of 127 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, which is equivalent to removing 30 million cars from the world’s roads. This remarkable achievement has placed Gabon as being the first African country to get paid for reducing carbon emissions and forest degradation. It is massive news to not only the African continent but also the entire world in fighting against carbon emissions and by extension climate change. The payments come as part of a breakthrough agreement between Gabon and the Central African Forest Initiative, which was launched by the United Nations in 2015, having backing from donors; and with the 10-year deal, signed in 2019. This could place the country to receive almost €126 million (Sh16.1 trillion)if it meets its targets to further cut carbon emissions in half by 2025. A very good initiative by an African country. I hope we as Kenyans can and should learn from them. Onali Nduw Nairobi.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
