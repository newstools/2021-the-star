Karachuonyo MP Adipo Okuome has raised concerns over reports that some political parties were illegally recruiting members at night in his constituency. He cautioned his constituents to be wary of people demanding identification cards for registration. “I want to appeal to my constituents to be careful with unscrupulous people who are asking for details of their IDs. Don’t share details of your ID or give a photocopy of such,” Okuome said. He called for investigations into the reports, saying his office has received several complaints. The lawmaker said those behind the racket are targeting the youth and vulnerable groups, especially the elderly. “It is unfortunate that a few individuals with selfish interests are duping our people to register to parties whose ideologies are unknown to them,” he said. He also called on those who have attained the age of 18 to apply for IDs, saying many youths lack the document. Okuome said the document is important as it is required in most transactions including government services, travelling and financial matters. The legislator said it is mandatory for someone who has reached 18 years to acquire an identity card, failing which one will be guilty of committing a criminal offence under the Registration of Persons Act. He said many IDs remain uncollected at the Registrar of Person’s offices in the subcounty. “We are calling upon the owners of the uncollected identity to collect them,” he said. Okuome also urged residents to continue registering as voters ahead of the 2022 General Election. “You cannot elect leaders of your choice if you are not registered as a voter,” he said.
