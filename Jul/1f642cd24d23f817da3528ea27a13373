Forwards Steve Sakari and Boniface Ochieng have been ruled out for Sunday's must-win Rugby World Cup qualifier against Zambia at Nyayo Stadium. The duo sustained injuries during last weekend's shock 20-19 loss to Senegal and are yet to recover.  Head coach Paul Odera said they will also make five positional changes for the vital clash against Zambia. “We have done our analysis from our defeat to Senegal and we are ready to make amends. The boys are determined and are looking forward to the game,” added Odera.  He said they  are looking at tightening the defence especially from the set-piece. "We are looking at closing up space especially at the scrum and line-out. We gave away too much space to Senegal last week," noted Odera.  The former international said they have worked hard in improving the line-out after Senegal dominated all facets of play last weekend. In attack, Odera said body position with ball in hand will be vital if they are to win the encounter. "From our analysis when in attack, we were getting our body position wrong and the opposition was able to get turnovers. This is, therefore something we have worked on with the players this week,” said Odera. Kenya and Zambia clashed two years ago with the Simbas winning 31-16. The Southern African outfit lost20-5 to Senegal on Wednesday. Odera said he  expects a close contest. "Both teams are under pressure to win. We have done our analysis on them and we know they are quick and nimble. We will have to nullify that threat and win the collisions upfront,” added Odera. On the same day, Kenya Under -0 team will face Madagascar in the Barthes Cup final. Elsewhere, there will be three Kenya Cup matches on Saturday.
