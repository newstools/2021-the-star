The war between Law Society of Kenya President Nelson Havi and CEO Mercy Wambua has intensified after the society advertised and shortlisted three applicants for the chief executive position. Through one of the local dailies dated July 16, 2021, LSK said that it received three applications for the position of CEO and secretary to the council. Of the three, two applicants have been shortlisted for the interview which will take place on Friday, July 23. The society had invited applicants for the position on June 29, and by the end of the application period on July 14, three people had applied. The three were Mutua Ngumbau Nzioka, Juliette Akoth Jakaila, and Josephat Mutunga Mutisya. "After reviewing the here applications for completeness and conformity with the requirements that had been set out in the advertisement, two managed to be shortlisted," the advert read. Mutua Ngumbau Nzioka and Josephat Mutunga Mutisya will be interviewed on Friday at the LSK headquarters located at Gitanga Road, Nairobi. Nzioka will be the candidate to face the council at 10.20 am, while Mutisya will appear at 11.20 am. Wambua was sent on compulsory leave in June to pave way for the recruitment of her replacement. During the meeting, 118 members supported the motion to sent her on leave while 16 members voted against it. Thirty-three of the 118 were physically present at the Gatanga Road offices. Last week, Havi was arrested by the detectives from DCI over assault allegations. Havi who is accused of assaulting Wambua was taken to DCI headquarters for questioning. LSK President allegedly injured Wambua during a meeting on Monday. Police said they had asked Havi to present himself for questioning over the claims but did not honour the same. Havi dismissed the claims saying Wambua forced her way into the boardroom while they were having a meeting with the intention of recording the proceedings.
