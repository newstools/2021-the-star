The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Commission on Administrative Justice (Ombudsman) have launched investigations into irregular hiring at the Kenya Trade Network Agency. The probe followed an anonymous complaint to the agencies by a member of the public who questioned the appointment of two managers. The appointments of director corporate services and director of strategy, compliance, and business development is also a subject of review. CAJ chief executive officer Musa Bashir in a letter to Kentrade CEO said the complaint cited violations of the human resource and procedure manual guiding promotions, appointments, and confirmation of staff. There are concerns that the jobs may have not been advertised as provided in the Mwongozo Code of Governance. CAJ thus sought to be furnished with Kentradeâ€™s career progression guidelines, advertisement of the listed posts, and list of applicants as well as shortlisted candidates for the positions. It also wants the interview report giving a summary of scores for each of the candidates and the appointment letters. Following the reports, the EACC has taken up the matter and has already taken statements from the Kentrade Human Resources and Administration manager Hellen Wasike. Among documents the anti-graft agency sought to review were letters requesting for authority for filling of vacancies held by the said officers. They also sought board papers relating to the filling of the posts as well as written opinion of the chief executive officer on the recruitment, promotions. EACC has also interviewed Kentrade director of corporate services and the head of legal services over the anomaly. The agency also sought to review confidential/personal files for the two managers, as well as approval of their promotions. KenTrade is under the National Treasury and is mandated to facilitate cross border trade and manage the electronic single window system. -Edited by SKanyara
