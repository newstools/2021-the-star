Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company will shut down the water supply pipeline along Uhuru Highway on Thursday. The shutdown will take place from 6 am on July 15 to 6 am on July 16 due to ongoing construction of the Express Way. Among areas to be affected include; the whole city centre, areas along Mombasa road, South B and C areas,  University of Nairobi main campus, JKIA, Nairobi Central Business District. Others are; Coca Cola Factory, EPZ Athi River, the whole industrial area, areas along Jogoo road, City stadium, Maringo, Bahti, Buriburu and the surrounding estates. “This will facilitate interconnection of the relocated new and old water pipeline on Uhuru highway between Haile Selassie Avenue and Bunyala road junctions with Uhuru highway to enable the release of the road corridor to the expressway road contractor," the notice read. "We appeal to our customers for indulgence and also urge them to use available water supply sparingly." President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the 27km project on October 16, 2019, as part of the plan to decongest the Central Business District. The project, implemented by KeNHA, is a four-lane dual carriageway that connects the Nairobi-Mombasa section and the Nairobi-Nakuru highway section terminating at Waiyaki Way. In September last year, Kenya Power announced it was relocating power lines along the highway and will bill Kenha Sh1.08 billion. It is expected to be completed in December 2022 by the China Road and Bridge Corporation. The expressway will have 10 interchanges, including the SGR terminus at JKIA, Eastern Bypass, Southern Bypass and Enterprise Road. Others are at Capital Centre, Haile Selassie Avenue, Thika Road, The Mall in Westlands, Sarit Centre and James Gichuru Road.
