A door-to-door major campaign has been launched in Garissa county to trace the owners of more than 9,000 uncollected Huduma Namba cards. County commissioner Boaz Cherutich cited the current drought in the county and the destruction of telecommunications masts by al Shabaab militants as reasons for the low collection of cards. “Many residents have either migrated to other areas in search of water and pasture or have not received text messages alerting them on where to pick up their cards due to lack of mobile network connectivity,” Cherutich said. So far, 9,938 out of the 22,996 cards received remain uncollected. The administrator spoke to the press after a closed-door meeting with chiefs and assistant chiefs at the Government Guest House in Garissa. Cherutich said the campaign, to be coordinated by the chiefs and heads of Nyumba Kumi initiative across all subcounties, will start soon. “Those Kenyans who are supposed to collect their cards cannot be traced or do not have the information that the cards are available in our offices. We have made arrangements to make sure that all the cards are distributed to the Registrations of Persons offices in all the subcounties,” he said. “In order to attain our targets and ensure that the 9,938 individuals are issued with the cards, we have commenced a door-to-door campaign that will be conducted by our chiefs, their assistants and Nyumba kumi elders.” The county commissioner said his office has written to mobile service providers requesting them to restore services and promised to deploy additional security personnel to ‘terror hotspots to guard the masts’.
