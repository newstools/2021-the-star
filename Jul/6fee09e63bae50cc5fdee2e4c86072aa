Kenya's Emerging Stars made a promising start to their Cecafa U-23 campaign with a 3-0 thumping of Djibouti in their opening Group C encounter at Bahir Dar Stadium in Ethiopia. Ulinzi Stars’ marksman Joseph Njuguna opened Kenya's account eleven minutes into action with a left-footed screamer 20 yards out, after being neatly set up by KCB speedy winger Reagan Otieno. The KCB man later doubled Kenya's advantage in the 64th minute after rising unmarked to head in Austin Odhiambo’s enticing delivery from a set piece. The Kenyan lads were not done just yet. After an interplay of crisp passes between him and skipper Bernard Ochieng on the right channel, Kariobangi Sharks’ right full-back Fredrick Alushula lobbed the ball over to Benson Omala who soared above his markers to nod in Kenya's third. The win has fired coach Stanley Okumbi’s charges to the summit of Group C, where they sit pretty on three points. They return to action on Wednesday when they will flex muscles with South Sudan. Either a win or a draw in their next match will guarantee Emerging Stars a place in the semifinals of the regional showpiece. Earlier in the day, DR Congo and Uganda played out to a barren draw in a balanced Group A affair.
