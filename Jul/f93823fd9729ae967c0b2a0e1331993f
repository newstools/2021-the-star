A new police commander for Coast region was Thursday named in mini changes.Manase Musyoka, formerly the Migori County commander took over as the Coast Regional Police Commander replacing Paul Ndambuki who had posted in Mombasa in April. Ndambuki was moved to police headquarters, Nairobi for redeployment. Cases of hooliganism especially in Kilifi had emerged as a major concern, which some officers cited for the changes. Two weeks ago, three people including a local prominent investor were killed in a land dispute by goons who had been hired. More than 20 people are in custody over the incident. Police headquarters termed the changes normal aimed at boosting their operations. In Nairobi, Buruburu subcounty commander Adamson Bungei was moved to Central in the same capacity to replace John Nyamu who moved to Embakasi. Embakasiâ€™s Francis Ngugi replaced Bungei in Buruburu. The changes were occasioned by demands to conduct operations on street children and parking boys who have been a menace in the last five months.

They include Augustine Nthumbi (Nairobi), Robinson Mboloi (Rift Valley), Peris Muthoni (Western), Titus Karuri (Central), Karanja Muiruri (Nyanza), Rono Bunei (North Eastern), Noah Mwivanda (Eastern) and Musyoka (Coast).
