The coronavirus pandemic, that has been reported in almost every country in the world, has left many national economies and businesses reeling from losses and states struggling with lockdown measures to fight the spread of the virus. Although the pandemic has created chaos in many sections and infrastructure the world over, the trajectory for digital transformation is gathering momentum. As the pandemic continues to dominate headlines, the development and deployment of information and communication technology infrastructure and its attendant services has meant a continued trend towards digital transformation for societies, businesses and governments alike. Even as Kenya grapples with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the role of ICTs and digital services has become central to continued economic and societal activity and to lessening the pandemic’s impact. The country should therefore increase digital connectivity to mitigate against the negative economic shock of the virus. Covid-19 has forced a greater demand for digital reliance across the board, and this outcome is likely to be here to stay in the “new normal”, as the utility of more abundant data and the ever-lower cost of using those data influence how entrepreneurs, policy-makers and professionals make decisions. Kenya has the opportunity to set an example for Africa in how to use emerging technologies in areas such as digital payments, precision farming, predictive health and many more to address its most pressing challenges.
