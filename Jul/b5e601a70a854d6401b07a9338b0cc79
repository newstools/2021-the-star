Deputy President William Ruto has challenged leaders to focus on issues that will better the lives of the people. He said Kenyans want the politics that is anchored on development. “The hungry want food on their table; not the change in the Constitution,” he said. He spoke on Saturday in Kilifi County during the burial of Bishop George Mwangome Chipa and his brother Adam Goe Chipa. “We are going to talk about the economy and the empowerment of millions of Kenyans living in poverty,” he insisted. Ruto asked Kenyans to rally behind transformative leaders. “Do not support a leader just because he is from your tribe. Check on his development track-record," the DP said. He regretted that some leaders were still stuck in old ways of conducting politics that is guided by hate, division and empty promises. “Do not engage in the gambling of your future,” he explained. The Deputy President was accompanied by MPs Richard Chonga (Kilifi South), Paul Katana (Kaloleni), Benjamin Tayari (Kinango), Owen Baya (Kilifi North) and Aisha Jumwa (Malindi). Kilifi South MP Richard Chonga, who was elected on an ODM ticket, said he will be making a move to the hustler nation “soon”. “Where you are seeing me now is where I am. This is because we want more development in Kilifi,” he said. He noted that he has faith in Ruto and his dedication to take Kenya back to the growth path. While welcoming Chonga’s take, Kaloleni MP Paul Katana and Kinango MP Benjamin Tayari, said the Coast region will support the Deputy President in 2022. “We are organising ourselves politically. We want to be in the Hustler family because this is the right direction for our region,” Kilifi North MP Owen Baya added. Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa argued that they were behind the United Democratic Alliance “that promises a new start for our country.”
