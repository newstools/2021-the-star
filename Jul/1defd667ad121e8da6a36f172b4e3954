Actress Kate Actress' firstborn son has turned 15. Taking to social media, the mother of two described her son as her ‘good luck charm’. “My baby is 180 months today. You changed my life in ways I could never imagine," she wrote. "You really are a blessing. You are the bestest big brother, my forever litu boy, may you grow in fear of the Lord. May he protect you from evil, may he grant you wisdom. Happy Birthday @leevsthewrld." In November, Kate said her mother took a loan of Sh400K for her school fees in Uganda and she ended up pregnant within the first three months of joining campus. She added that things were not easy as she had disappointed her mum who had invested so much in her education. She welcomed her second child, daughter, Karla, with her husband Phillip Karanja in 2019.
