South Sudan’s First Vice-President Riek Machar has launched the consultative process for a commission that is key to the 2018 revitalised peace agreement. The unity government was tasked with creating a Commission for Truth, Reconciliation and Healing in the agreement. This also includes establishing an independent hybrid judicial court to investigate and, where necessary, prosecute individuals bearing responsibility for violation of international law. The hybrid court for South Sudan will have jurisdiction over the following crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious crimes under international law and applicable South Sudanese laws. The timeline is for crimes committed from 15 December 2013 until the end of the transitional period. Machar said the commission will seek to ensure transparency. “We want to provide the aggrieved a chance to speak. We talk of peace, but peace without justice does not hold,” Machar said.
