Rapper King Kaka says he hid his identity while visiting his wife Nana Owiti after she welcomed their first child. Speaking on Nana's YouTube channel, the couple opened up on parenthood, and the fears they had about it. They got their firstborn daughter when Nana was still living at her home. "When we got Geezy, we did not even have money, no car. I used to take a motorbike to Kitengela to see Nana. I would cover my head with a hat, and a scarf on my face," he said. He said he feared becoming a parent because of the financial implications of it. For Nana Owiti, what scared her most about being a mother was the pain of childbirth. "I had traumas from my ushago, I saw my auntie give birth. I was in class three or four. When I heard the baby cry, I walked in to see. I found my aunt filled with blood. The sight of that and how she wailed scared me," she said. The thought of being a mother was not so scary for her as she had raised her younger sister. "I was a few steps ahead in parenting because I started raising my sister when I was 19.I was scared about giving birth, and whether I will be fit enough as a mother. So as I don't make mistakes that were done to me as a child." The couple are raising their two children.
