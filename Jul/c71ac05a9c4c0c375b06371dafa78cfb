Businessman Jimal Marlow has been in the middle of a family feud after his two wives took their fight to social media. His wives, Amira Marlow and socialite Amber Ray, traded words to a point where Amber Ray had to move from Syokimau to Kilimani to avoid meeting each other. Early this week, Amira's confidential conversations were leaked online by blogger Edgar Obare. In them, she claimed her husband is abusive and is not as rich as he makes it out to be online. He is debt-riddled with bank loans. Jimal responded to the claims. "I came from nothing. I was a makanga. No one raised me from there," he told Word Is. "For me to be where I am with what I have right now, I did not get it from anyone." Speaking about taking bank loans, Jimal defended himself, saying, "I will not lie, I take loans to finance my businesses. Every businessperson in this country that has a humble background, you have to take a loan to raise yourself to go higher." He added, "I owe Sh150 million in loans to a bank and another Sh80 million and another bank I owe Sh90 million. If you owe three banks that amount then you have a good income to sustain those loans. "A bank is not your mother's house to check in and they will just front you the cash. They have to look at your net worth, assets and then decide to give you a loan." He continued, "People are saying I have loans. Yes, I have loans even you personally kama unataka loan, enda kwa bank. And I pay them well."
