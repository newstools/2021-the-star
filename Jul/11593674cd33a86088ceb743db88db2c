Politicians have been urged to be tolerant of each other and preach peace and unity as the country prepares for next year’s general election. Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju said some political leaders have been dividing Kenyans and causing chaos instead of providing leadership. “It is unfortunate that it is us leaders who bring tension. When we say we are people of faith, we often don’t put that into practice. Many times we choose toxic politics over unity,” he said on Thursday. Tuju was speaking in Gichugu, Kirinyaga county, during the funeral service of a former civil servant in the Ministry of Public Works, Eng Edward Kariuki.  Kariuki was Tuju’s relative. The former Rarieda MP called on communities to intermarry, saying this will help cultivate unity and counter tribalism that has been one of the core vices in the country. “I have relatives in Kirinyaga, Kiambu and Nyeri. We are all one and belong to one Kenya. This is our home. When we see our children intermarrying across the ethnic divides, they are just humans with no mistakes,” he said.
