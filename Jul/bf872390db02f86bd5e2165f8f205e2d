Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai has asked residents of Rioma village in Marani subcounty to partner with the police to ensure the safety of the community. Mutyambai said despite the recent stand-off between the police and residents over claims of police brutality, officers have been working day and night to ensure residents are safe. “Give us information about criminals in the community, and we will deal with them accordingly,” he said. Mutyambai spoke during a visit to Rioma police station in the subcounty following an outcry from residents over alleged police brutality. The Inspector General assured residents that challenges posed by the police will be handled promptly to restore the cordial relationship between security personnel and the public. Last month, residents staged protests at Rioma police station over the alleged death of a man in police custody and the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old girl during the protests. Edited by A.N
