Rapper Khaligraph Jones has partnered with Odibets under their Odimtaani initiative to launch the ‘OdiNare’ rap challenge. The goal of the online rap challenge is to uplift talented rappers who are struggling to come up in the Kenyan music industry. Last week, Khaligraph Jones went live on Instagram highlighting how rappers in the Kenyan music industry are finding it hard to come up due to different challenges thus he had decided to start a rap challenge. Pledging an Sh500,000 cash prize for the best rapper, Papa Jones said he will hand out Sh10,000 daily to various winners and offer a chance for three upcoming artists to join his record label Blu Ink Corp for a one-time record contract. Khaligraph Jones noted that the winner will also have the opportunity to work on a collabo with him. Heeding Khaligraph Jones call, Odibets will boost the rapper's rap challenge project by offering Sh4.5 million cash boost thus the winner will walk away with Sh1 million among other prizes for the various participants. Speaking to journalists during the launch of the rap challenge, Odibets General manager Dedan Mungai said; "We decided to support Khaligraph and the whole Kenyan music industry as a way of giving back to society and nurturing untapped talent that is out there." He then handed the Sh4.5 million cheque to Khaligraph Jones. Khaligraph Jones said the one-of-a-kind challenge is going to be big and will help bring up new talent into the Kenyan music industry. "The OdiNare challenge is going to be big and stars will be made from this platform, watch this space and if you are a talented rapper jump onto the bandwagon coz you never know you might be the lucky winner," said Khaligraph Jones.
