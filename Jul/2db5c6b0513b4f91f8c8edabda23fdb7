 National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has promised to fight endemic corruption in government if elected president next year. Muturi is among several politicians including Deputy President William Ruto and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi who have declared interest in succeeding President Uhuru Kenyatta who retires next year. Muturi said his candidature is serious and that he is capable of steering the country to greater heights. "I have said it before that I am not participating in the race to fight for the second position but the top seat. I know how the country operates and I am capable of handling the state as president," Muturi said. He was speaking during a meeting with Pentecostal church leaders at his home in Kanyuambora, Mbeere subcounty, in Embu on Saturday.  Muturi said he was ready to traverse the country to preach unity and ask for votes ahead of next year's August elections. The church leaders prayed for Muturi ahead of his campaigns. Muturi promised to be at the forefront in the fight against corruption. "I want to get the country back to where it used to be when the activities in the government offices were more efficient. President Kibaki introduced the Vision 2030 blueprint but as of today we are still not sure of achieving most targets in the great plan due to corruption in its implementation," he said. The speaker said Kenya does not lack people who are capable of leading the nation but those who are honest and responsible. The religious leaders criticised politicians from the Central region who dismissed Muturi's coronation by elders in Murang'a in May.  "I want to tell the leaders from Central Kenya that we have our own now. Let them support us the same way we have supported them before. Mt Kenya East has a capable leader who has shown his ability in the Parliament and we want to award him the top seat to bring the discipline and order in the country," Bishop Silas Muriuki said. Muriuki also urged Muturi to unite all churches.  Edited by P.O
