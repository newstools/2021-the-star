Musingu Boys High School football team new coach Brendan Mwinamo is keen to revive the school's lost glory “At the moment, I am focusing on helping Musingu High restore the lost glory. We have managed to strengthen the technical bench and also recruited quality players straight from the primary schools," he noted. Mwinamon said: “We have set our targets and we want to see how things will unfold as we strive to return to school games. Our local FKF organised leagues  have also contributed a lot in terms of offering experience." Mwinamo, however, he expressed his great respect for Kakamega High School soccer team popularly known as Green Commandos. Mwinamo, who is now settling in Musingu after a long stint at Kakamega High, has produced many soccer stars,who are currently involved in top leagues around the globe . The tactician is one of the most successful coaches in the region having assisted the Green Commandos to win three national titles as well guided them into the National Super League. Mwinamo revealed that Kakamega High, where he has been both a student and a teacher, will always remain close to his heart. "Kakamega High has made me the person I am today," he noted. He encouraged healthy rivalry in football but warned that this shouldn't be translated into enmity. "Competition enhances quality football  and  professionalism and that should be our target." Mwinamo further thanked Musingu High School principal Bernard Lukuya who has invested a lot in sports.|
