The Service Party leader Mwangi Kiunjuri and Laikipia Senator John Kinyua have faulted the government for the recent commodity taxes it reintroduced. Speaking on Sunday during a fundraiser at Timau PCEA church in Meru, they said Kenyans were suffering and with no money in their pockets. The leaders urged the government to address the burning economic issues. “We have increased taxes on fuel and cooking gas which are basic commodities. It is okay for the government to build roads and airports but do they benefit Kenyans who do not have money?” Kiunjuri asked. Kiunjuri said former President Mwai Kibaki’s administration had directed banks to lend money so people can engage in business. Today, no financial institutions are willing to lend because they too are broke, he said. Kinyua said Kenyans have suffered enough from the coronavirus pandemic, urging the government to reduce taxation on fuel. “In Laikipia, if we are not being killed by wild animals and cattle rustlers, then the government is continually increasing taxes, thereby making life very difficult,” Kinyua said. He said that if fuel taxes were to be reduced, the cost of living would decline since the price of commodities revolves around fuel. Kiunjuri said the political coalitions being formed are for political gains and not meant to benefit ordinary mwananchi. “Kenyans are not fools and are no longer backward. What they want from their leaders are the policies, programmes and promises fulfilled,” he said. “The next elections will not be about political parties but about individuals who can deliver.” He said Kenyans are tired of coalitions because they have been formed before, only for the leaders to betray voters.
