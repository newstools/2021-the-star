Some 900 livestock traders and farmers in Garissa have received Sh6.1 million to mitigate against economic disruptions due to Covid-19. Garissa Governor Ali distributed cheques on Tuesday at the Agricultural Farmers Training Centre. Korane called on the beneficiaries to utilise the money for the intended purpose. He said the money, part of the Sh15 million Livestock Market System grant from USAID, will improve livelihoods and benefit the communities. “The grant is aimed at supporting market actors, entrepreneurs and farmers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic to enable them to bounce back with viable economic opportunities as the crisis subsides,” Korane said. The governor also unveiled other in-kind support to the livestock farmers worth Sh8.4 million that included a mobile veterinary lab for rapid response to pastoralists in far-flung areas. Other items were 20 sets of handwashing equipment, 50 sets of protective gear and equipment for livestock markets, butcheries and slaughterhouses. Korane also distributed 12 sets of flexible flaying knives, butcher straight knives for the slaughterhouse and 20 aluminium meat carriers for butcheries LMS county programme manager John Kutwa said the Sh15 million stimulus grant was the result of a direct engagement between Korane and USAID mission director Mark Andrew Meassick early in the year. “Garissa is the only county in the country to receive direct Covid-19 response support from USAID as a result of your engagement and it will go a long way in helping our farmers to recover from the impact of the global pandemic,” Kutwa said. Present were county assembly speaker Ibrahim Abass, executives Mohamed Shale (Livestock), Issa Iyow (Finance), Issa Yarow (Roads), Abdi Farah (Water), livestock director Haret Hambe, among other leaders.
