The glamour to have the country's second most prestigious competition played in a befitting venue finally bore fruit just 48 hours before the clash. FKF head of leagues and competitions, Frank Ogolla, confirmed the development with a terse post to acknowledge that what is expected to be an enthralling duel -FKF Betway Cup final between two of the country's most successful clubs will be played at Nyayo Stadium on Sunday, July 4. "Finally Nyayo stadium it is," said Ogolla, whose post was accompanied by a trophy engraved FKF Betway Cup 2021. A place to host the final which will pit Gor Mahia against their arch-rivals AFC Leopards has left the federation's top honchos with a headache. As late as Thursday, the top billing clash had been earmarked for Utalii after being shifted from Ruaraka. To get Nyayo as Kasarani will be busy with the Athletics Under 20 trials, is therefore a big bonus. The contest will still be played under the government protocols on containment of Covid-19 meaning there will be no fans to savour the contest. Both sides needed post-match penalties to edge past Bidco United and Equity respectively, in the semifinals. A chance to represent the country in the 2021/22 CafÂ  Confederations Cup as well as Sh2 million cash prize is at stake for the winner of the match, which will be a repeat of the 2013 FKF Cup final. Bidco United, meanwhile, will be gearing up for a clash against Equity in the third-place playoff, a curtain raiser to the grand finale.
