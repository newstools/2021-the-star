The Garissa administration is setting up a Geographic Information Systems laboratory to help track water, education, health, roads project. The GIS lab will also help to facilitate development planning and management in the areas named and in rangelands, environment and natural resources. The platform will store and manage digital footprint of development projects in the sectors. GIS-based database systems are a legal requirement aimed at providing data for use in formulating the County Integrated Development Plan. The technology is important for decision-making during planning and allocation of resources. Deputy county secretary Yunis Yussuf on Thursday said a 13-member GIS resource team has been appointed to oversee the establishment of the lab. Yussuf said the geospatial technology is necessary for Garissa because it still faces numerous challenges. The challenges include unplanned settlements, degraded rangelands, inadequate or unplanned infrastructure and low quality of development projects. In addition to poor monitoring systems, there is mushrooming of new settlements and inequitable resource allocation due to lack of appropriate tools for decision-making. "We have resolved to use GIS technology in recognition of these challenges and the need to streamline monitoring of development projects and ensure equitable resource allocations based on evidence," Yussuf said. Present were donor relations and coordination director Mohamed Sahal, water director Osman Aden, special programmes director Abdikadir Arab, environment and natural resources director Mulki Mohamed.
