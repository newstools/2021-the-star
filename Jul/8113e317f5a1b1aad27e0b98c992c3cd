At least 840 families living in slums in Embu can now build permanent houses after they were issued with title deeds. Governor Martin Wambora on Thursday issued 269 title deeds to the residents of Kathita and Kimangaru slums. Speaking during the ceremony at the Embu Talent Academy, Wambora said the county government will embark on improving living conditions through the provision of infrastructure and strengthening security of tenure in informal settlements. “More than two generations who have been living in informal settlements can now develop permanent residences and go about their businesses without fear of eviction,” he added. Lands executive Jane Ndegi said the project was initiated in 2013 with the aim of investing in infrastructure and service delivery interventions, enhancing tenure security, planning and survey, strengthen institutions and project management and urban growth. “The relationship between the county and national governments with regard to the implementation of the project has been well received and we hope to further bring services closer to the people living in informal settlements,” Ndegi said. The residents of Kathita and Kimangaru were full of joy and lauded the county government of Governor Wambora for securing their future through awarding them the ownership documents. “From today, I will sleep soundly and without fear of eviction or demolition as it has been in the past,” said Michael Ngari from Kimangaru. The project was a joint initiative of the Embu county government, the World Bank, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and the Ministry of Lands. Edited by Henry Makori
