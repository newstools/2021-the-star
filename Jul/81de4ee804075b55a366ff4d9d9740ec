Residents of Kimalat near Kitengela town in Kajiado have raised concerns over an investor’s proposal to put up a steel plant near their homes. On Wednesday, residents woke up to posters from the investor pinned on tree trunks, notifying them of the plan. The owner of the land, in the undated notice, has given the residents 14 days to raise any issues. The notice stated in part, “The registered owners of land reference number Kajiado/Kaputiei-North/5925 situated in Kitengela proposes to change its use from agricultural to industrial use (metal processing).” County physical planning acting director Fred Swaleh told residents that the government will not approve any changes on land use without putting the matter to public participation. Swaleh said the investor erred by not dating his notice because that would put more worry on the interested parties. “The investor is supposed to put such notice in the national newspapers indicating the intent and the number of days for the public to see,” he said. He advised the residents to write to his office raising all their concerns before the matter is put before the public. “We operate above board and this same matter shall be addressed as it is stipulated by the law,” Swaleh said. Lands executive Hamilton Parseina told residents that nothing will happen behind their backs. The residents say setting up a metal factory in a residential area will expose them to pollution and diseases associated with industrial waste. National Environmental Management Authority county director Joseph Kopejo said the matter is a physical planning issue but residents can engage the concerned office because the notice is part of public participation. “Environmentally, we have no issues to raise at this point because there will be a separate process of environmental impact assessment later,” he said. The residents fear that if the change of use is approved, their lives will be put at risk by factory emissions. -Edited by SKanyara
