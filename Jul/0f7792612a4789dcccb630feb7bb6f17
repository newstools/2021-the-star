National women's beach volleyball coach Sammy Mulinge feels experience will carry the day for Kenya at the Tokyo Olympic Games later this month. He said the combined experience Gaudencia Makokha and Brackicides Agala was a major asset for the country ahead of the game. Despite this being Kenya's debut at the quadrennial event, the tactician said the the duo have played in various international competitions and gained enough exposure under their belts. " I do not expect them to experience stage fright," he emphasised. Kenya have been drawn in Group 'E' alongside Brazil, USA and Latvia. "Agala has been in this competition for a while  and knows exactly what is required of her. Her exposure in other fields makes her exceptional. Makokha, on the other hand, has played senior beach volleyball up to the World Championships  save for the olympics. If they can use their knowledge properly, they are bound to make an impact," he explained. "Brazil and USA are ranked higher than us while Latvia is a decent side. However, we are analysing them to know how best to handle them. Our first objective is to get a set,"  he added. Mulinge is also pleading with Olympics Kenya to accommodate Yvonne Wavinya and Phosca Kasisi in the Tokyo travel plans for the sake of exposure. Mulinge, who doubles up as the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) coach, feels his youngsters deserve to travel with the team having worked tirelessly during the qualifiers. "I have requested Olympics Kenya to consider letting the two travel with us. Wavinya and Kasisi are upcoming  and it is painful to leave them out having fought so hard during the qualifiers. They are central to our plans and they need this kind of exposure for their wholesome growth in the sport." The team is likely to travel a week before the competition serves off on July 23.
