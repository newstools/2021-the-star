Emerging Stars head coach Stanley Okumbi is convinced his charges have sharpened their claws well enough to charge effectively for this year's Cecafa Under-23 tournament that kicks off in Ethiopia on Wednesday. “We have had a good session in camp and believe we are capable of attaining a positive result at the regional tournament,” said Okumbi. Okumbi spoke during the team’s final training session at Nyayo Stadium on Tuesday, the same day the regional body conducted the draw for the tournament. Emerging Stars are set to leave for the northern city of Bahir Dar on  Wednesday. Kenya have been pooled in Group 'C' alongside Djibouti and South Sudan. Group 'A' comprises defending champions Uganda, Tanzania and DR Congo, while Group 'B' has hosts Ethiopia, Burundi and Eritrea. Kenya will open their account against Djibouti on July 19 and then face South Sudan on July 22. The top teams in each of the three groups will proceed to the tournament’s semi-finals, alongside the best-placed runners-up. In the semis, Group 'A' winners will flex muscles with the best runnersup as Group 'B' winners lick horns with Group 'C' winners. Third place playoff and the final will be held on July 30. The organisers were forced back to the drawing board after both Somalia and Rwanda pulled out of the tournament at the eleventh hour, with the latter citing a spike in Covid-19 caseloads in the country, making it impossible to raise a team.
