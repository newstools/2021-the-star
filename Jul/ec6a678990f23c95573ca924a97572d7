Three trailers ferrying limestone from Twimuma area of Kyuso subcounty in Kitui were impounded by Kamuwongo police officers for exceeding weight limits. The drivers were found ferrying excess limestone and using low volume tarmac to transport the materials. Kenya National Highways Authority engineer Eric Momanyi said the three trailers had carried over 10 tonnes of the material used to make cement. He said the drivers will be charged at Mwingi law court for carrying overweight materials and using low-volume tarmac to transport them. “According to the delivery note, the three were transporting the materials to Athi River in Machakos where the company manufactures cement,” he said. Momanyi said there's a designated road for trucks ferrying the limestone. The arrests come less than a month after the county government of Kitui banned limestone mining in Twimuma. Environment, Tourism and Natural Resources executive Patrick Musau said residents had complained that the blasting activities was causing noise pollution. The residents also complained of dust, disruption of learning in nearby schools and cracking houses. They wanted the investor to address the issues. However, the investor obtained a court order to continue mining limestone in the area.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
