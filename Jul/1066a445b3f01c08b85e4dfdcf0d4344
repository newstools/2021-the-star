Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi says he will not comment on his impeachment until official communication has been made to his office with the grounds for the planned removal. Saisi while speaking to the Star on Saturday on phone said he only learned about the looming impeachment motion via the media. “But MCAs should not go viral to condemn me unheard. First, they should give me a chance to be heard and a right of  reply to the allegations that are on the floor against me,” Saisi said. “In case they will want me to appear before their ad hoc committee, I will do so, but I have no faith in them because they have already made their minds to have me out of the office,” Saisi added. Saisi told the Star he will seek his justice at the Senate where his fate will be determined without any corrupted minds. The DG’s cry comes after the county assembly approved a motion seeking to remove him from office. The notice of motion that was tabled by Wodanga MCA Vincent Atsiaya was signed by 37 MCAs. Shiru ward MCA Nixon Butiya did not sign the motion. The notice of motion cited that Saisi violated the Constitution, engaged in abuse of office and gross misconduct. But Saisi said he was elected alongside Governor Wilber Ottichilo and the assembly has no power to send him home. Edited by Henry Makori
