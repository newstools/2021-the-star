It is exciting and interesting to be on campus, but very hard to survive there. Most universities and colleges students suffer a lot, especially due to financial constraints. 'Comrades' as they call themselves, will most days go without food for lack of money. Sometimes, students will indulge in drugs and use the money from their parents to go to parties. Others style themselves as politicians and buy alcohol for their friends, depleting their cash. Some students drop out of school when Helb loans are insufficient and parents cannot top up. Universities and college students should use their intelligence to start businesses for self-reliance. They should find a side hustle or two to cater for their needs. As a student, you should understand your family background and work hard to bring light to society. Joan Hellen  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
