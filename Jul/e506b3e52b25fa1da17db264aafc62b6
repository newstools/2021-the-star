The re-constitution of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission heralds the sense of urgency as the clock ticks towards the general elections in the next 12 months. A lot needs to be put in place to ensure all systems are functional and meet the expectations of Kenyans. The selection panel interviewing shortlisted candidates should ensure that the commissioners selected are beyond reproach in terms of integrity, professionalism and competence. They should also represent regional, ethnic and gender balance to attract public trust and confidence. The 2022 elections are poised to be the most expensive and competitive politically. The lack of an incumbent seeking reelection opens up the battleground to a new political dispensation that requires a neutral and trusted arbiter in the name of IEBC. The incoming commissioners together with the chair Wafula Chebukati have a daunting task ahead. IEBC should ensure that there is a smooth transition of power by carrying out a credible, free and fair election that ensures that even the losers accept the results. Suspect systems, especially the transmission and tallying, have always been a thorn in the flesh. Aggressive voter education and registration exercises should commence immediately to avoid the last-minute rush. The ICT systems to be used need to be procured early and electoral officers manning them trained early enough. Kenyans do not want a flawed electoral process that is a recipe for mistrust and poll chaos. I urge all Kenyans to also exercise their constitutional and electoral rights by voting in leaders that will bring down the high cost of living, create employment and improve the economy.
