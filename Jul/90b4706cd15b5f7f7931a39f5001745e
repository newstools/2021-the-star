Ulinzi Stars head coach Benjamin Nyangweso has extolled his charges for exhibiting great character in their hard-fought 2-1 win over a resilient Wazito side, during their closely contested Kenyan Premier League encounter at ASK Grounds in Nakuru on Wednesday. Nyangweso hoped his side would maintain their fine form in their next fixture against struggling Western Stima. "This win is very important heading into our next league assignment against Western Stima. The boys did well to overcome a side that came determined to grab maximum points against us," said Nyangweso. "Right now our main focus is on winning each and every game. We are not so much worried about what position we will be at the end of the season." Kevin Kimani had a glorious chance to put the moneybags ahead in the 14th minute from a set-piece but his effort swirled inches wide. He must have rued the missed opportunity when Mark Bikokwa put the hosts ahead in the 21st minute. But Bikokwa momentarily turned from hero to villain after collecting a yellow card a minute later. Eager to make a difference, Wazito tactician Francis Kimanzi effected a tactical change in the 40th minute, when he brought on Whyvonne Isuza and Eric Otieno for Brian Musa and joseph Odhiambo. Then exactly on the stroke of half-time, Wazito centre-back Johnstone Omurwa committed a grave howler when he turned the ball into his own  to double Ulinzi's advantage. Then in the 71st minute, Kevin Kimani made amends for the earlier missed opportunity when he came on the end of a superb through ball to pull one back for Wazito. Following the result, Ulinzi have dislodged Wazito from eighth — where both have 34 points — but the soldiers enjoy a healthier goal difference.
