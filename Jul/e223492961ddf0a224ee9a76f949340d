The Media Council of Kenya has appointed a task force to review betting and related activities in media outlets. In a statement on Wednesday, the council CEO David Omwoyo said the team will address all betting emerging issues, best practices and their impact on the media industry. The task force consists of eminent media sector professionals led by Emmanuel Juma, who was known for his political humour segment dubbed Bull's Eye that aired on NTV. Other members of the seven-member task force include; Wangethi Mwangi, Ken Bosire, Ruth Nesoba, Julie Masiga, Tole Nyatta and Lydia Radoli. "The Council has noted that the content in advertisements and talk shows often does not meet the standards established in law," Omwoyo said. "The regulation of such content is important to safeguard the accuracy of information consumed by the public." The council has reiterated that advertising gambling on media platforms is a potential public health issue that may have a direct and material effect on gambling participation, particularly by children. "Recently, it has been observed that media houses are taking part or running gambling programmes without licenses and advertising gambling outside watershed hours in some cases during children shows," Omwoyo said. The council said it had found it necessary to develop structures and processes that will enable organised and collaborative interventions within the sector. Omwoyo said the task force will assist MCK to find out the nature of betting in media houses as well as investigate the media houses' ability to vet advertisements and outside content and shows.
