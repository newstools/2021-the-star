Centum Real Estate Limited has reported a consolidated profit of Sh650 million for the year ended March 31 2021. This profit has been driven by profit from residential units, sales development rights and gains on investment properties. Centum Real Estate recorded residential unit sale deposits of Sh1.8 billion in the year, a 20% increase from Sh1.5 billion recorded in 2020. “The effect of Covid-19 containment measures was an initial slowdown particularly in Uganda, but this changed in subsequent quarters and our average monthly cash collections have increased by 73% ,” Real Estate Managing Director, Samuel Kariuki said. Centum Real Estate completed the construction of two projects in Vipingo and Uganda, in addition to launching three new projects in Nairobi. Two of the new projects attained the pre-set market validation threshold of 30% and their construction has commenced. In the sales-led development model, Centum Real Estate seeks to pre-sell at least 30% of a project phase before ground-breaking. Centum Real Estate had cumulatively sold 1,281 residential units with a total sale value of Sh11.5 billion as at March 31 2021. This represents 63% of the total units either completed, under construction or under market validation. “These sold units have a profit potential of KES 2.2 billion, which is expected to be booked progressively from the financial year ending 31 March 2022," Kariuki said.
