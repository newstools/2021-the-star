Presidential aspirant and Amani National Congress leader, Musalia Mudavadi has urged Rift Valley residents not to vote based on fear in the forthcoming election. He said people should stop viewing elections as a moment of turmoil but a time of peaceful renewal. Speaking at PCEA Neema Church at Teachers Estate in Nakuru on Sunday, Mudavadi said he was looking forward to a peaceful transition from President Uhuru Kenyatta's era. "As we exit President Kenyatta's era, let us not fight; elections time is a God given moment of renewal," he said. He also urged people to vote with their conscience and pick prudent and progressive leaders instead of selecting based on ethnicity. Mudavadi observed that there was fear and insecurity in the country and urged the government through the Ministry of Interior to intervene. "There is a lot of kidnappings and enforced disappearances, women cannot live in peace because they fear for their children," he said. The former Vice President is in Nakuru for a two-day tour which started on Saturday to champion his economic blueprint for the region. On Saturday, he held several closed door meetings, one with Governor Lee Kinyanjui and another with the business community and professionals. Today he is set to attend two church services and later have a consultative meeting with different groups at Kunste Hotel. During the service at Neema PCEA, Mudavadi said kidnapping of children was on the rise. "Interior Cabinet Secretary, Fred Matiang'i should put in measures to end the trend that has the country afraid," he said. On the economy, he said people were suffering because of mismanagement and plunder of public resources.
