The government of Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) has invited Southern African Development Community (SADC) organ on Politics, Defence and Security (Troika) on a fact-finding mission into the country. The country’s minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Thuli Dladla made the announcement on Saturday. Dladla said that the mission will arrive in the country on Sunday, 4 July 2021. The invitation comes amid protest in the country, citizens calling for major constitutional reforms. The ongoing protest is largely being led by the young people demanding major reforms. The protesters have been calling for King Mswati to make way as part of democratic reforms, including free elections. On Friday, the government of the Kingdom of Eswatini condemned the acts of looting that have been witnessed during ongoing protests. The Acting Prime Minister Themba Masuku said that the riots have degenerated into criminality and are infringing on many and basic social rights of emaSwati. “While we continue to protect and to promote the full expression of all constitutional and human rights, including the right to protest, we cannot condone the attacks on emaSwati and their property.”
