Kanu leadership in Kiambu is seeking to expand party membership in Central region, primarily targeting women and youth. Kanu Women Congress national secretary Gladys Chania said this would be done through empowerment programmes to be implemented by the party and its partners in all counties of the Mt Kenya region. The same will be expanded to other parts of the country. “It is the only political party that has weathered political storms since Independence,” Chania said. She spoke in Kiambu on Tuesday. Last week, Kanu chairman Gideon Moi visited Kiambu and held meetings with MCAs and a number of party leaders. During the tour, Gideon drummed up support for Jubilee Kiambaa MP by-election candidate Kariri Njama. The Kanu chairman said the party will also support Jubilee's candidate for Muguga ward by-election. The two by-elections will be held on July 15. Gideon said he had made several visits to Mt Kenya counties including Embu, Meru and Tharaka Nithi during the BBI sensitisation tours. He asked Kiambu residents to support President Uhuru Kenyatta's development programmes. Chania said after the by-election, the party will aggressively market itself ahead of the 2022 General Election. “There is enough space for women and youth in the party through empowerment programmes by the party and the partners,” she said.
