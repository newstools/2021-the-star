Residents of Naivasha have received a donation of equipment to be used for monitoring the quality of water in rivers and lakes in the region. The River Health Assessment equipment worth Sh1.5 million was donated by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF-Kenya) in partnership with UK based fresh produce seller TESCO. According to WWF-Kenya Rift Lakes Programme Manager, William Ojwang, involving the community in data collection will help them understand the need for collective responsibility. "The main goal of this project is the establishment of a citizen-led Naivasha Rivers Health Assessment framework for the improvement of water quality and flow in the basin, leading to increased freshwater ecosystem health and business resilience," Ojwang said. The equipment donated includes; scooping nets, sorting trays, Dissolved Oxygen meters, PH kits and Turbidity Tubes. WWF-Kenya CEO Mohamed Awer noted that water from Lake Naivasha has made an immense contribution to the Kenyan economy but because of population increase and the areaâ€™s growth into a town, there pressure on available resources like water. He added that the equipment donated to the Water Resource Users Association will provide a water monitoring mechanism to ensure there is compliance with water allocation and supply plan. "In 2009, the lake receded by nine metres to the extent that large growers were digging trenches up to 6km to the highest water point and that was a wakeup call to growers," Awer said. Lake Naivasha WRUA Chairman Enoch Kiminta said that with the right data, they will be able to hold accountable those polluting rivers in the area. He stated that the association is fully armed to collect data and monitor pollution in rivers, which will help them influence policies on water resources management. "Addressing challenges of water quality and quantity can be difficult unless one has the right equipment for the task," he said.
