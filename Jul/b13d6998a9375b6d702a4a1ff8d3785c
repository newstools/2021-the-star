Wajir Governor Ahmed Mukhtar on Sunday urged residents to support his administration. The governor said he would use the remaining term to improve services and unite the county. He promised to prioritise the health and water sectors, saying the people of Wajir are craving efficiency and good governance. Mukhtar, who took over as governor on May 18 following the impeachment of former Governor Mohamed Abdi, spoke in Eldas constituency when he welcomed Education CS George Magoha to the area. “You all know that I took over when the county had a lot of issues, including poor governance, that led to members of the public losing trust in the county leadership. Since then, we have held a series of citizen engagement forums to try and correct things,” he said. Mukhtar said the consultative dialogue forums with Wajir residents are aimed at enhancing good governance, human rights and gender equality. “I am happy to report that these meetings are yielding fruit. The future looks bright for our county.” Mukhtar said it is the responsibility of all leaders to serve the electorate without discrimination. "As servants of the people, it is our civic duty to at all times inform the public of our services, engage and incorporate their opinions in executing public services," he said. Eldas MP Aden Keynan said they will support the governor to ensure he delivers. “For us, all that matters is service delivery to our people. That is all that we are interested in, not the political sideshows. The governor knows this very well,” the legislator said. Edited by A.N
