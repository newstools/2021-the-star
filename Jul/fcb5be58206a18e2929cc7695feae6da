Former WCB signee Rich Mavoko says his mother raised him alone after his dad disowned them. Speaking to Massawe Japanni on Radio Jambo, the 'Show Me' hitmaker said he did not meet his father. "I never met my dad until he died. It was hard but the fact that I didn't know him, I was not affected," he said. "When he was alive, he did not look for me and that made me feel very bad." During the interview, Mavoko said the reason he left Wasafi is he disagreed with his former boss Diamond Platnumz. "We disagreed business-wise. I had my stand and he had his, and so I left." In the past, Mavoko said his exit from WCB was a messy and noisy affair rather than a mutual one. This was after he expressed discontent with his contract, which he termed as "exploitative and malicious".
