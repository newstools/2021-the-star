A woman has lost eight teeth after being attacked by her co-wife while in company of her husband. This was after losing three teeth and the dentist recommending that five teeth which were loose be removed. Sara Muteisi grievously injured Esther Chebet on June 25 at Kawangware alongside another man who has not been arrested. A report states that Chebet was headed home at night at about 10pm in company of her husband. They found Muteisi waiting for them at the entrance of their home. Muiteisi grabbed a stone and used it to hit Chebet in her mouth. At that instant, three of her teeth were knocked out and she bleed profusely. A man then appeared armed with a wooden bar and hit Chebet on her arm, causing her more injuries. She was screaming for help and her husband who was, shocked by the turn of events rushed her to the nearby clinic - St Catherineâ€™s - where she was given First Aid before being referred to another health facility to have an X-ray because more teeth seemed loose. Following an X-ray report, the dentist recommended that five more teeth were to be removed. A P3 form was filled after the degree of injury was indicated as grievous harm. Muteisi was arrested and taken to Kibera court where she pleaded not guilty. The court granted her a bond of Sh100,000. The matter will be mentioned on July 14.
