Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi has called out ODM leader Raila Odinga for pretending all was well in the country, while the economy was going down. Mudavadi said he has been raising concerns over the state of the economy and the need to revive it, and those who didn't listen to him are now coming out to preach the same. "Those who pretended that all well have now been smoked out of their hide-outs," he said in a tweet on Thursday. The former Vice-President went on to say reviving the economy should be the main driver of the administration that will take over after President Uhuru Kenyatta's retirement in 2022. He added that his ANC party slogan (Uchumi Bora Kwa Wote) advocates for an economy that works for all. "The resuscitation of the economy, which I have continuously advocated for should and must remain the main agenda going to the next phase of leadership," Mudavadi said. Mudavadi's remarks come a day after the former Prime Minister said many Kenyans are struggling to make ends meet, and the only way this can be remedied is by building an economy that works for all. Raila said that building such an economy will have to start with the promotion of small and medium enterprise businesses and by also encouraging realistic taxation and innovation. "All Kenyans have great aspirations and expectations amidst struggles to make ends meet. Our youth are struggling to clear school, secure good jobs, stop depending on parents, start families and, save for the future," Raila said. On Thursday, Deputy President William Ruto welcomed Raila and Mudavadi into what he termed as a Hustler nation-led economy conversation. In a tweet, the DP said the political conversation has now changed and it's based on what the Hustler nation has been championing - A people-centred, jobs focused empowerment. "Leave the leaders-centred Constitution change to create positions, share power/meagre resources among the elite. Karibuni," Ruto said.
