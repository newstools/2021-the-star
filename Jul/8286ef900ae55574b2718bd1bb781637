Limuru MP Peter Mwathi has asked the Jubilee Party to take action against legislators campaigning for UDA candidate Njuguna Wanjiku ahead of Kiambaa by-election. Mwathi said they had openly disobeyed the party, which sponsored them to Parliament. “This is lack of respect to the President, who is also the party leader, is not what the party requires,” he said. The legislator warned Kiambaa voters that electing the UDA candidate in the July 15 by-election would amount to consigning themselves to the opposition before next year's general election. Mwathi has taken over the Parliamentary Security Committee seat that was left vacant after Kiambaa MP Paul Koinange died on March 31. He urged residents to elect Jubilee candidate Kariri Njama, saying he has the blessings of the President. “President Uhuru had a lot of respect for Koinange and he would want to use Njama to see him finish the projects Koinange started,” Mwathi said. He dismissed claims that UDA is popular, saying it is testing if it can win a seat in President Uhuru’s backyard but not necessarily to deliver anything to the people. “Why do you campaign and confuse people. UDA is a new party. Do not send yourselves to the opposition while you were in the middle of a government that is still ruling,” Mwathi said. The Kiambaa by-election is becoming a two-horse race between Njama and Njuguna. Other contenders include Mwalimu Richard Ngugi and accountant Evans Gichia. Mwathi dared all the rebel Jubilee legislators to tender their resignations to the speaker of the National Assembly and seek a fresh mandate from voters.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
