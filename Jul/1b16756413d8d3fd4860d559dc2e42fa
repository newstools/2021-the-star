Police in Kericho have launched a manhunt for a father suspected to have defiled his three daughters before fleeing. Kericho police commander Silas Mathiu said the three girls, aged between 14 and six, have since been transferred to one of Kericho's children protection units. Mathiu said the suspect and his wife have 10 children, five of whom the wife sired with another man before she got married to the suspect. Speaking to the press outside his offices, Mathiu said the suspect defiled two of his stepdaughters before turning on the third one who he biologically sired with his wife. Mathiu said the suspect's wife alerted the police but the husband managed to flee. The man is an employee with one of the multinational tea companies in the county. The county police boss decried increasing cases of defilement being committed by fathers against their daughters and appealed to residents to report such incidents. He said last week, a 14-year-old girl was waylaid by a man and defiled before being murdered. Her body was later found and retrieved from a nearby river with deep cuts all over. The suspect is yet to be arrested. -Edited by SKanyara
