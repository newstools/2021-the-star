Kenya’s FIA rally stars Hamza Anwar, McRae Kimathi and Jeremy Wahome are upbeat ahead of the 3rd round of the African Rally Championship scheduled to start from Friday to Sunday in Tanzania. The trio, who are sponsored by Safaricom and Kenya Airways, will be making their debuts in Tanzania  and will give their Ford Fiestas a second outing after last month’s Safari Rally. “I am thrilled at this opportunity because it is my first time to take part in the African Rally Championships. It is a new challenge but from the experience I gathered at WRC Safari Rally last month, I am confident I will perform well,” said Jeremy Wahome. Wahome and Anwar, 22, and Kimathi 26, are some of the youngest drivers who featured in last month’s WRC Safari Rally that made a comeback in Kenya after a 19-year absence. Wahome finished in 16th position, Anwar (25th) while Kimathi retired at the final stage due to a mechanical problem. This is the second time Hamza Anwar is taking part in the Africaan Rally Championships after finishing fifth during Africa Rally Championship Equator Rally that was held in April this year. McRae Kimathi finished in 8th. The three will once again be driving the M-Sport Fiesta Rally 3 sponsored by Safaricom and Kenya Airways. “I appreciate the opportunity that Safaricom and Kenya Airways has given us to grow our talent. My aim is to improve my results,” added Wahome. ARC will also see Carl ‘Flash’ Tundo, a five-time winner of the Safari Rally and winner of Equator Rally held in April, defend his title in Tanzania. He is also the 2019 Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC) champion, making him the only Kenyan winner of an IRC round. He was also among the drivers that Safaricom sponsored during the WRC Safari Rally.
