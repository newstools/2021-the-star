All delegates to the 7th Annual Devolution Conference next month must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the Council of Governors has said. The conference will take place in Makueni between August 23 to 26 at Makueni Boys High School. It is expected to attract at least 5,000 delegates, including the President and the Deputy President. Plans have been made by the Council of Governors and the Health ministry for additional vaccines to be provided to the Makueni county government so that service providers like hoteliers and boba boda riders are vaccinated before the conference. “This will be a physical meeting and not virtual. The requirement is that all participants are vaccinated. This is the last annual conference and all the governors will attend,” CoG vice chair James Ongwae said during an inspection tour conducted on Friday to assess the level of preparedness. Also present were Health CAS Dr Rashid Aman and Devolution and ASALs CAS Abdul Bahari Ali. The conference steering committee also paid a courtesy call on Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana in his office. “The Ministry of Health will provide vaccine services for the delegates who will be attending the devolution conference in Makueni county,” Aman said. The conference had earlier been scheduled for May 3 to 7 but was postponed due to the Covid situation in the country. The 7th Annual Devolution Conference will focus on climate action, in particular the impact and the role of sub-national governments. Data from the ministry shows that by Friday, 1,035,621 people had received the first dose of the vaccine while 572,361 had been fully vaccinated, representing a two per cent proportion of the adult population that has received the two doses.
