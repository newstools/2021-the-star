Deputy President William Ruto has called upon leaders to desist from insults and deceit as they seek to outdo their opponents in the political arena. The DP said that leaders should instead commit to competing with each other on the platform of ideas and issues. Ruto was speaking when he met grassroots leaders and opinion shapers from Ndia Constituency, Kirinyaga County in Karen, Nairobi County on Thursday. “Leaders must commit to compete with each other on the platform of ideas and issues. Rather than engaging in insults and deceit, they must work towards transforming the lives of the people,” Ruto said. He added that Kenyans are sufficiently informed to make informed decisions, which are based on the leaders’ development track-record. His call comes amid increasing political pressure ahead of the 2022 General Election, as interested leaders try to outdo opponents. The meeting is part of Ruto’s hustler narrative series, where he has been engaging leaders across the country. On Wednesday, the DP was in Machakos County during an empowerment programme of traders. He said that his team was intensifying plans to empower Kenyans through the bottom-up, middle-out economic model by focusing on issues that will improve the lives of Kenyans. Ruto added that politicians should desist from politics that is guided by hate, division and empty rhetoric and anchor their issues on development.
