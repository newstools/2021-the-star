A confession note allegedly authored by Caroline Kangogo - the cop accused of killing two people - has emerged, hours after her body was found at her parents' home in Elgeyo Marakwet on Friday. DCI said she committed suicide. In a long draft text message, Kangogo said she suffered depression and lamented about her husband, whom she accused of philandering and neglecting her and her children. The message appears to meant for her brother as she asked him and her parents to take care of her children because "their father is too much into women". Kangogo asked that she be buried at her parents' home because her husband 'dumped' her. Kangogo was a suspect in the killing of two people, including police Constable John Ogweno, in Nakuru on Monday, July 5. She later allegedly shot dead Peter Ndwiga Njiru, 32, in a lodging in Juja, Kiambu county, about 200km from where the police officer died. An autopsy showed Ogweno died of a haemorrhage. Njiru's autopsy said he died out of bleeding from the head. In the draft text, Kangogo did not show remorse for allegedly killing Njiru, writing he conned her out of Sh1.5 million. She did, however, show remorse for allegedly killing Ogweno, asking for forgiveness from his family. Kangogo also wrote that she underwent sexual harassment in the police force. She also said she was not shown support at work as she had to make several trips to hospital due to her child's asthmatic condition. Police say Kangogo shot herself at about 7.30 am Friday at Nyawa village, Tambach division in Keiyo. Her parents called police who found the body in a pool of blood in the bathroom. Rift Valley Regional Commissioner George Natembeya confirmed the incident. “We are told the mother found her holding a pistol which she used to commit suicide in the bathroom in their rural home,” he said.
