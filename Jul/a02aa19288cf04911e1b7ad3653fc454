It is less than 13 months to the 2022 general election and so many things and activities are happening in our country. The recent being the public interview of positions of Chief Justice and Supreme Court judge. In the history of our country, we got the first female Chief Justice and she is doing marvellous at her new job. Currently, interviews to fill the vacancies for commissioners of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission are ongoing. The number of women in the process is encouraging. Most importantly, they are smart, knowledgeable and experienced. From their current roles, they are diligently giving a majority of them higher chances of steering the commission forward on a positive foot. Through the process, many women are rising and getting consideration for the public and leadership positions in the country. The women are fighting among themselves for powerful roles while competing with men too. They are out to fight for leadership positions and not leaving anything to chance. With this trend, more will come out for the political seats. Meeting the two-third gender rule is still facing hurdles but women are telling the nation that they must stand out and be counted. With this empowerment, maybe the next Parliament won't have a hard time implementing the two-third gender rule. Hopefully, it comes to pass. Nairobi  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
