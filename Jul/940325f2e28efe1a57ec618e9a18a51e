Former Vihiga Public Service and Administration executive Pamela Kimwele has said her removal from office was unlawful. Kimwele was removed alongside three other executives – Amos Kutwa (Health), Paul Mbuni (Lands) and Kenneth Keseko (Trade). She said the assembly had received court orders not to execute their removal. “The court had suspended the process of removing the four of us until July 8, 2021,” Kimwele said. “The four of us obtained a court order from the High Court in Kakamega on June 17, 2021, to suspend the implementation and or execution of the report by the county assembly to implement an ad hoc committee report on the unrest of health workers, coordination of county public service pending bills and implementation of county assembly resolutions by the county executive.” Kimwele said the assembly ignored the orders. The order states, “Should you fail to comply with the court order, we shall immediately institute contempt of court proceedings against persons holding the respective offices and petition the court to have them declared unfit to hold public office among other sanctions.” But Governor Wilber Ottichilo dismissed the four executives as recommended by the assembly. Speaker Hasna Mudeizi said the removal of the four was within the law. The Vihiga county assembly in May recommended the removal of the four county executives from office, citing gross misconduct and failure to honour summonses by an ad hoc team. An ad hoc committee of the assembly recommended that the assembly commence removal proceedings within 14 days after the approval of the report.
