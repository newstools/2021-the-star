Diamond's manager Babu Tale has marked one year since his wife Shamsa Kombo died. On his Instagram page, Tale shared photos of his family and said they are still in mourning. "A year ago, a day like this, God decided to take one of us, something that we are still mourning every day. May God continue to rest you in peace." This comes a few months after he rubbished social media claims that he plans to remarry soon. "I believe the institution of marriage is a very important thing that deserves respect. I got married a long time ago by Allah's words," he said. "My wife's shadow lives with me, so I'll wait until the shadow disappears then I'll remarry." He added, "My wife told me not to remarry. I remember that day when I was in the hospital with her."
