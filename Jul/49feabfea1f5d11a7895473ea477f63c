Starring: Sarah Shahi, Mike Vogel, Adam Demos, Margaret Odette What makes a show of a film take the number-one spot on any streaming site? It has to check several boxes and appeal across a diverse audience. A challenging feat for any producer or director. When I saw that ‘Sex/Life’ had been trending at the number-one spot on Netflix since its release, I got curious. Billie Connelly is a mother of two living the suburban dream. Her husband Cooper is an investment banker who is devoted to his family. From the outside, the Connellys are the poster for the picture-perfect family. However, Billie keeps a deep dark secret of her past. Her life was once an exciting orgy of sex, desire and fantasies that came to life. Right at the centre of her old life was Brad. Brad is the hunky Australian music producer who changed Billie’s life. Together, their life was a roller-coaster of emotions and erotic lovemaking. Billie starts finding herself reminiscing of the old days until she runs into Brad. When her past threatens to destroy her picture-perfect present, what will Billie choose? In essence, the show addresses the midlife crisis that most people go through at a certain point in their lives. However, instead of digging in deep into the quandary, it tries to entice the viewers with over-the-top sex scenes. The show might be trending now, but it is for all the wrong reasons. It loses its rhythm and goes round in circles trying to make a point but it fails terribly. The writing is shallow, the acting sub-par and at most, the racy scenes are endurable.
