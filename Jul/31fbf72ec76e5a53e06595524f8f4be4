The statement by the former Prime Minister Raila Odinga is like a manifesto. But Kenyans have sharp memories. They remember everything. The last person to speak about anything to do with the rule of law is Raila. Does he really understand the rule of law? When he swore himself in at Uhuru Park yet he knew there was a genuinely elected president, Uhuru Kenyatta, whom he is now supporting, wasn’t he breaking the rule of law? Raila used [Ruaraka MP] TJ Kajwang' and [deported lawyer] Miguna Miguna to swear him in. Where was the rule of law at that time? Talk of respect for the Judiciary, his handshake brother is the President. And Miguna, who swore him in, was deported and there is a court order that he be allowed back. Raila is almost a principal in this government. So, which court ruling is he telling us to obey if he cannot tell the President to allow Miguna back? The President has not appointed the judges of the Court of Appeal despite a court order. Why can’t Raila advise or convince his handshake partner to follow a court order and appoint the judges? If we speak about peace and cohesion in this country, sincerely, how can Kenyans trust him with that? Let’s go to the other issue of corruption. In 2015, he used a paybill number to raise funds to pay striking teachers. Not a single teacher was ever paid. In 2017, he raised money for campaigns using paybill number and then he boycotted the repeat elections. Did he return that money? He should be the last person to speak about corruption. For that manifesto, I think the former prime minister should consult people further. He should rework the manifesto and find a way of convincing Kenyans. Otherwise, Kenyans remember everything about him and it would be very difficult to convince them to elect him in 2022. The nominated MP spoke to the Star
