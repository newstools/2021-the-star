President Uhuru Kenyatta has cancelled his planned two-day tour of Ukambani region over fears the visit may trigger a spread of Covid-19. The President was to visit the region on Tuesday. There had been disquiet over perceived unfair distribution of 'Handshake goodies' with Uhuru visiting Nyanza in May and unveiling several projects. Uhuru had visited Kitui on June 25 for the official launch of the Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Protection in Museve. He had met Ukambani leaders in mid June. In the two-day development tour, the Head of State was expected to visit Machakos and Makueni counties. In Makueni, the President would begin his tour at the Konza Technopolis in Makueni before proceeding to inspect the Thwake Dam project and later launch Kibwezi-Kitui road. Uhuru would then inspect ongoing government projects and launch new ones in a bid to pacify the region. During a previous meeting with Lower Eastern leaders, the President called for the unity of the National Super Alliance, ahead of next year's General Election. Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu and her Machakos counterpart Alfred Mutua were among the leaders who attended the meeting held at State House, led by Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka.
