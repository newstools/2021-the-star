The Kajiado County Government has announced a 50 per cent cut on all licenses for bars and restaurants this financial year. Announcing on Thursday afternoon, Governor Joseph Lenku said his decision to slash the levies was informed by job losses and economic struggles experienced by traders. Lenku said the most hit by the Covid-19 pandemic are the struggling traders in the bars and restaurants sector. He announced a raft of changes that include waivers and an increase in operational hours. He directed that a 50 per cent waiver be effected on all the licenses payable to the Kajiado County Alcoholic Drinks Control Board by bars and restaurants for the 2021/22 financial year. Lenku said all the application fees payable to the board be suspended for the 2021/22 financial year. “Licences falling under the same department be harmonized and merged for ease of payment and administration,” said the governor. Governor Lenku also recommended that the Kajiado County Alcoholic Drinks Control Act (2014), be amended to provide for board membership to include representatives of bars and restaurant owners’ associations from each of the five sub-counties. The county government also increased operational hours for bars and restaurants two hours earlier within their respective working hours. “The move is meant to assist the business community in the food and entertainment industry in their recovery process from the COVID 19 pandemic effects. He added that it will also help them to retain their current staff and recall those who may have lost their jobs.
