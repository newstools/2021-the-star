The immediate former Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary General Wilson Sossion has refuted claims that he resigned from the union after intervention from ODM leader Raila Odinga. Speaking on Monday evening, the former Knut SG said that the Orange party boss respects democracy, insisting that he resigned from Knut out of his own will. "Hio ni porojo. Raila hawezi na anaheshimu demokrasia ya watu, kwa hivyo hiyo ni fitina… Ilikuwa hiari yangu mwenyewe," Sossion said on NTV, which loosely translates to, "That is small talk. Raila cannot do that and he respects democracy... it was out of my own will." The nominated MP noted that Raila is his party leader and whenever they have a conversation; it’s usually about politics and the affairs of Kenyan workers in parliament. "I have pushed for salary increments for teachers, I have pushed for employment of teachers and I saw that I have accomplished a lot at the union but it was time for me leave," he added. This is the first time the former Knut boss was speaking after announcing his resignation from the teachers’ union. Sossion resigned on June 25, after three years of leadership conflict in the union and the Teachers Service Commission. The union boss in a press conference at the Windsor Hotel in Nairobi said he had outgrown Knut and will focus on articulating workers' issues through his parliamentary post. "I shall remain loyal to Knut and always be available to advise and support the leadership," he said. Sossion's resignation came just hours to the Knut election, which was scheduled for Saturday, June 26, 2021.
