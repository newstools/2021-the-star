Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang has asked the county government to recruit more staff for the Intensive Care Unit at the referral hospital. Kajwang said health workers in the ICU will help in the fight against Covid-19. The senator said an acute shortage of trained health personnel has compromised service delivery in combating the virus at the hospital. Speaking when he toured the hospital on Monday, Kajwang said the government had established and equipped the ICU but it lacks personnel to operate it. He said lack of adequate staff to operate the facility shows its unpreparedness in the fight against coronavirus. “An ICU shouldn’t be only beds and ventilators as we have noticed here. We want the county government to fast-track recruitment of personnel to make our ICU fully functional,” Kajwang said. He said the situation makes it difficult to handle Covid-19 patients who need ICU services. “I am going to talk to Governor Cyprian Awiti to see how the health workers can be recruited,” he added. Homa Bay branch chairman for the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers Stephen Obunga said the ICU has only two critical care nurses instead of at least five. Obunga said the facility does not have an ICU doctor but has just one clinician. The union official said the staffers should be trained to offer ICU services. “The matter is with the government but little has been done. We’ll succeed in the fight against Covid-19 and other diseases effectively if all the issues we’re raising are addressed,” Obunga said. The hospital currently has 24 Covid-19 patients in the high dependency unit. A few weeks ago, the hospital suffered a serious shortage of oxygen. According to the hospital's acting CEO, Peter Ogola, they are trying to address the challenges. Edited by Henry Makori
