National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has ruled out joining any  existing coalition, calling them indisciplined. Muturi said on Sunday he welcomes any like-minded people to join him and form a disciplined and orderly government. He was speaking at ACK St John's the Apostle Kanyuambora where he attended the Sunday service. He said forming coalitions is not a bad idea and he welcomes anyone who wants to join him. "The most important is having people who are matching my virtues, which are driving my urge for the topmost seat, and not just forming a coalition for the sake of it," Muturi said. He also said that there is no right time to form a coalition, citing Mwai Kibaki's Narc of 2002, formed a few months to the election, as a good example. The debate about parties merging to form coalitions is currently a hot  topic but Muturi said he doesn't think there's a reason for him to rush. "Kenya is a multiparty democratic state and political parties are free to unite if they have an agreement. If I have to merge with anyone, it has to be on the basis of agreement, fundamental areas of integrity and the desires of those parties," he said. Muturi said he is his own man and not anyone's project. He said he wants the topmost position in the country and he will not be dissuaded. The speaker called for young people all over the country to be brave and vie for leadership positions. He said that the future of the country is in their hands and thus they should not be scared by any rumours they hear about leadership. (Edited by V. Graham)
