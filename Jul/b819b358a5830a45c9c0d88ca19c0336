Deputy President William Ruto has told off critics of his weekly church donations that he will not stop. Speaking on Sunday when he attended a church service at the New Breed City Chapel in Kiambu, the DP said he has been accused of many things and some people don't like the way he worships. "Some have a problem about how often we go to church, others have accused us of carrying money to church but we will not stop." "We are looking forward to the day when we will not be taking thousands, when we will not be taking millions but when we will be taking billions to church," Ruto said. He went on to say that without God, he would not be where he is today. Ruto added that he should be allowed to worship God the way he feels right. "We didn’t have godfather’s we only had God the father. Please understand us and allow us to worship God the way we feel we should," he said. Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga has has been a big critic of the Deputy President, accusing him of perpetuating corruption through the church donations. Raila claimed that Ruto was pretending to be clean by offering huge sums of money to the church in the "guise of investing in heaven." “People who are moving around with money in sacks are always approaching innocent churches to be invited for a fundraiser and come to boast in public that they are investing in heaven. Which heaven?” Raila said. In 2019, Ruto accused the ODM leader of being behind a proposal that was to limit church donations. Ruto said Raila was the mastermind behind a Bill sponsored by Minority leader John Mbadi which sought to limit harambee donations to Sh100,000. The Bill proposes amendments to the Public Officer Ethics Act to require those giving more than Sh100,000 to declare to the anti-graft agency the source of the funds.
