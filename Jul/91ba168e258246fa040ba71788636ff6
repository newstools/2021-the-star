A Nairobi court has allowed police four more days to continue detaining a Chinese businessman linked to multi-million shillings money laundering. Milimani senior resident magistrate Sinkiyian Tobiko granted detectives from Directorate Criminal Investigations Kilimani office more time to enable them complete investigation linking businessman Deng Zian Kai to money laundering and being unlawfully in the country. According to an affidavit filed in court by investigating officer constable George Otieno, the suspect was arrested on June 30, 2021 at Kileleshwa in Nairobi, after they received intelligence report indicating that Deng runs a company dealing in a multi-million shillings money laundering. Otieno told the court that the company is used by the respondent to clean liquid cash proceeds obtained from traffickers of persons and narcotic substances. "The respondent has also used the said company in facilitating international traders to evade payment of taxes both locally in the republic of Kenya and other destinations in the world," said the officer. He told the court that the respondent's actions have diverse effects in the Kenyan economy. The court heard that following the said intelligence information, operation was conducted by detectives at the respondentâ€™s residence where entrance was forcefully gained after he failed to give access to the officers after proper identification. Otieno told the court that during the operation, a number of mobile phones, laptops and other electronic devices were recovered. He also said the suspect was in possession of a Zambian travel document as well as other Kenyan national identifications belonging to other persons. He said to achieve this goal, DCI Kilimani will be liaising with and getting correspondences with other agencies including, but not limited to Immigration, Interpol, drug enforcement Agency. -Edited by SKanyara
