Hundreds of residents of Mosiro in Kajiado county can now seek loans using land documents as collateral in commercial banks. Kajiado Governor on Tuesday issued 1,000 land allotment letters to plot owners and public institutions at Oldorko town in Mosiro ward. Governor Lenku said residents issued with the allotment letters can develop their plots. Public institutions including primary and secondary schools, dispensaries and churches were also issued with the documents to guard them against land grabbing. Lenku said the plots were secured, surveyed and allotted by the county land registry to deter fraudsters. The process started two years ago. “This exercise marks a new beginning in securing land rights of marginalised communities in rural areas, who had lacked the means to utilise prime land in their towns for economic empowerment,” Lenku said. He added that most of these prime lands were lying idle as no one could develop them. The new owners can venture into commercial activities. The governor urged plot owners to desist from disposing of them cheaply and instead use them to empower themselves and their families. Lenku urged the Maa community to unite in demanding their rights. “In future general elections, let us also vote as a block for the desired leaders. We have the numbers, and we can negotiate with other like-minded leaders for political goals,” Lenku said. Annette Sision, a resident of Mosiro town, said she struggled without success for close to 20 years to acquire an allotment letter for a plot. “I am so grateful to the county government for making this possible. I can now develop my property without fear of being evicted,” Sision said. Teresia Tikoishi, head of Naning’oi girls’ primary school and rescue centre for abused girls in Oldorko, thanked Lenku after she received an allotment letter on behalf of the school.
