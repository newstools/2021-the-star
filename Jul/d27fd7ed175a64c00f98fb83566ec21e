Kisumu county assembly has lost two of its senior staff - the deputy Clerk Nelco Sagwe and Senior Human Resource manager - Archbishop Lazarus Obera. The two died hours apart at the Aga Khan Hospital in Kisumu following short illnesses. Obera died on Saturday while Sagwe lost his life on Sunday. According to a statement by the assembly Speaker Elisha Oraro and Clerk Owen Ojuok, the two were dedicated and disciplined civil servants whose transformational leadership will be missed by the Assembly and particularly the staff they mentored. "Sagwe, a PhD finalist student at the University of Nairobi, was a highly experienced, dedicated and disciplined civil servant", they said. They said the assembly has lost a dedicated, hardworking and religious servant (Obera) - an elder who was a source of inspiration to many and who ably played the role of a counsellor and mediator in the Assembly. "On behalf of Members of the County Assembly of Kisumu, the House leadership and staff, we wish to convey our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the departed." Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o sent his condolences to the families of the two and the County Assembly. Nyong'o in a statement noted that the two officers were dedicated senior workers and their sudden demise is a terrible blow not only to the Assembly but to the County as a whole. "I wish, on behalf of the government, to send my sincere condolences to the Assembly leadership, friends and relatives of the two officers," he said. The governor added, "It is even more saddening that Mr Sagwe had just completed his PhD studies at the University of Nairobi and was awaiting graduation. May God rest their souls in eternal peace. Amen."
