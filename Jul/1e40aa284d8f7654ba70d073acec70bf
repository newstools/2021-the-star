Spain coach Luis Enrique said he had no complaints over his side’s Euro 2020 semi-final exit after a penalty shootout defeat to Italy on Tuesday, insisting he will only be congratulating his players for their efforts in the tournament. Alvaro Morata’s well-taken finish dragged Spain back into the game after Federico Chiesa had brilliantly fired Italy into the lead in the second half at Wembley. But after neither side could find a winner following extra time, Morata’s miss in the shootout proved crucial, as Jorginho’s spot kick sealed a place in the final for the Azzurri. “It is not a sad night for me, not at all,” Luis Enrique told a news conference. “Of course there is some disappointment but that is elite football. You have to learn to win and lose. “We talked a lot about how we wanted to play, the players believed in it and I can only congratulate them, I have no complaints. “We have shown that we are a team. Now it is important to recover and then we will meet again ahead of the World Cup qualification.” The former Barcelona coach singled out 18-year-old Barca midfielder Pedri for special praise. Spain’s Pedri completed all 56 of his passes in the 90 minutes of normal time at Wembley—only France’s Samuel Umtiti has ever completed more with 100 percent passing accuracy in a European Championship match since 1980. “No 18-year-old has done what he has,” Luis Enrique added. “His performances, his interpretation of the role, how he finds free space, his quality, his character... I have never seen anyone do what he does, it is devoid of all logic.”
