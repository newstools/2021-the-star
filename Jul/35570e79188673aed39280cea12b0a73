Kenya Safari Rally winner Sebastien Ogier has donated Sh2.5 million (€20,000) to two Kenyan charities. In a statement on Tuesday, Ogier said the charities, Nakuru Children's Project and Ol Pejeta Conservancy will each receive half of the amount. "Education is the key for a better future so I want to support Nakuru Children's Project with €10.000, and we should do everything in our power to protect this wildlife so I will also make a donation of €10.000 to Ol Pejeta Conservancy," Ogier said. Ogier stated that he fell in love with Kenya because of the support he received from locals during the Safari Rally competition he won a few weeks ago. "This wonderful country got a place in my heart," he said. The seven times World Rally Champion won the 2020 World Rally Championship held in Naivasha on June 27 after overnight leader Thierry Neuville hit a rock and retired his stricken Hyundai. The Ol Pejeta Conservancy works to conserve wildlife, provide a sanctuary for great apes and to generate income through wildlife tourism. Nakuru Children's Project is a UK based charity that helps children achieve their dreams through education.
