Former Tahidi high actress Angel Waruinge, alias Miss Morgan, says she is disappointed with her former colleague Omosh. The recovered alcoholic appealed for help from the public a second time after Kenyans raised money for him early this year. Through her YouTube channel, Miss Morgan said itâ€™s time Omosh accepted he is sick and needs help. "My brother, we had this discussion and society came through for you because you were a big name. But I saw your ungratefulness and this is what has hurt me the most. You are a crying wolf, you are disappointing so many people," she said. "While we were in that situation before, some chose to ask for help and they got it, some chose to change and they are changing their lives. Some chose not to get back into the addictions and they are thriving." Miss Morgan added that Omosh should realise he could be hurting his family, friends and even his former colleagues as they are getting trolled. "Accept that you need help, it has to come from you. Seventy per cent comes from you and the other percentage is from God and your family. People are not talking badly because you disappointed them. The world owes no one a living, so stop feeling entitled," she said. "Do you know how many people would have wanted to be helped? I am disappointed in you." Having overcome alcoholism, Miss Morgan said it is a disease and people should stop trolling the family and people who are not involved in it.
