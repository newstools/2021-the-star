We are doing extremely well in drumming up support for the Jubilee candidate in the Kiambaa parliamentary by-election. We have about 70 per cent on our side and want to push it to 80 per cent by the time constituents go to the polls on July 15. We are not leaving Kiambaa until the very last day. Our candidate, Kariri Njama, is the most suitable for the position. There is no doubt about it. He has been a candidate in the constituency in past polls. In 2013, he contested and came second. He did not leave the ground and in 2017, he again contested and came second. This means Njama is a person the constituents know very well, someone they relate with, who understands their needs and aspirations. The other group campaigning in Kiambaa seems to be focusing on something else. For them, they are not selling a candidate for the July 15 by-election but popularising a presidential candidate for 2022 General Election. When you look at their posters, you realise that a person who is angling to be a running mate will be pictured with their presidential candidate, with their candidate for the by-election behind them. For them, it is not about the Kiambaa Member of Parliament but the 2022 presidential election. For us, it is different. It is about our Kiambaa candidate. We know for sure he has the capacity and the drive to address issues facing the people of Kiambaa. Also, he has a foundation that has been helping people all along. We are therefore telling the people of Kiambaa not to allow themselves to be swayed by people who do not have their interests at heart. People from other areas are going to the constituency and pretending they know the needs of our people very well. We are telling the people of Kiambaa to elect someone who will be with them forÂ  a year. It is a critical time and they need someone who will complete projects started by the late MP Paul Koinange.
