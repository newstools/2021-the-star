The demolition of the standing portion of the apartment block that collapsed near Miami has been brought forward due to an approaching tropical storm. The upright section of Champlain Towers South will be destroyed within days to allow rescuers to search the site safely, officials say. The death toll has risen to 24, with 124 people missing after the collapse of the 12-storey building on 24 June. Officials are investigating other tower blocks for structural faults. On Saturday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the forthcoming demolition would "protect our search-and-rescue teams". He added: "We don't know when it could fall over. With these gusts that would create a real severe hazard." Storm Elsa, a 75-mph (120km/h) hurricane, could potentially hit Florida early next week. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Cava Levine signed a demolition order on Friday. She initially said she expected the demolition would not happen until late July. There are no details so far about compensating the owners. On Friday, a firefighter carried the body of his own seven-year-old daughter from the rubble of the collapsed block. He had kept vigil at the site for nine days and was there when she was extracted. Stella Cattarossi is the third child to be recovered from the site in the Miami suburb of Surfside. She was with her mother, grandparents and an aunt visiting from Argentina, according to local10.com. What caused the 40-year-old building to crumble remains unclear. But a 2018 inspection warned of "major" design flaws in the original design. The building association's board says it will appoint an "independent receiver... to oversee the legal and claims process".
