Children can be notoriously difficult to feed, from being picky eaters to ensuring they have a balanced diet.Â  It can also get pretty tedious trying to come up with a new meal and snack options for them, so we partnered with Suntop to help you out. Suntop recently released a new selection of juices that are healthy, sugar-free, and perfect for your little ones. They are also the perfect accompaniment for their packed lunch whether it's at school, on a picnic, or something you threw together while working from home. For our first recipe, we chose the egg salad sandwich. Here is how you make one. Ingredients Method For this recipe, simply slice your egg pieces and mix them with the mayonnaise and fresh herbs. Spread the mixture onto your bread slices and top with the tomato for a refreshing bite. Serve with some fruit as well as your child's favourite flavour of Suntop juice.
