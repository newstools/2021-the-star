Moses Kimathi, alias DJ Moz, has opened up about having a vasectomy as a family planning method. The Kubamba Radio presenter says the burden of contraceptives should not be left to women alone. In an interview with Capital FM's Valentine Njoroge, he said he chose to have the procedure after his wife developed complications with birth control methods. "I'm married and I have been for 13 years. The reality is that the burden of family planning had always been on my wife. My wife had been on the pill for the longest time and it was also not good for her and I knew it was affecting her," he said. "She and I had this conversation from time to time and we had agreed that it had to stop. We had come to the point where we now had three kids and the cycle had to stop. So vasectomy became an option." The DJ said the procedure was successful and he is functioning normally. This talk comes amid a heated debate after former radio presenter Nick Ndenda revealed that he had done a vasectomy. This was after he announced his breakup with his seven-year wife Muthoni Gitau. He said he opted for vasectomy since he did not want to get children, and also did not want his wife to have a hard time using contraceptives. “After seven years, this feels like the best decision for both of us. The plan is to grow and heal as individuals as we evaluate what we want moving forward.”
