Both leaders Kenya Police and second-placed Kibera Black Stars will be in the thick of action as the National Super League fixtures enter round of 26 this weekend. Kibera Black Stars lock horns with  Muranga Seal at St. Sebastian Park on Sunday, and a win might propel them to the summit of the log should Police falter in their efforts. Only a solitary point separates the two sides, with the law enforcers going into the weekend fixture a step ahead with 43 points. Kibera Black Stars appear to be the surprise package at the moment, having dislodged Talanta from second after pipping  Coast Stima 2-1 in their last encounter. Kenya Police managed a 2-0 win over MCF to fire themselves to the apex as Talanta slumped to third. Talanta, who are currently guided by Ken Kenyatta, had taken command of the proceedings for the better part of the season, but their fortunes seem to be dwindling after blowing hot and cold in their recent outings. Police have a date with Kisumu All Stars at Moi Stadium, Kisumu in one of the rescheduled matches set for Sunday while Talanta will flex muscles with Modern Coast at GEMS Cambridge on the same day. On Saturday, MCF and Migori Youth lock horns at Thika Stadium on the same day that Soy United host Nairobi Stima at ASK grounds in Nakuru. Shabana will look to maintain their steady run when they come up Kisumu Hot Stars at Narok Stadium. The Kisii-based side have experienced a rise on the curve since the appointment of former Migori Youth tactician Robert Ojienda, and a top three finish looks very likely. Coast Stima and Mwatate United will battle it out at Mbaraki while Fortune Sacco and Mt. Kenya will settle scores at Kianyaga ground in Kerugoya. Mt. Kenya, who have been battling relegation for the better part of the season got a new lease of life after securing a sponsor to boost their fortunes. Gusii will host Silibwet at Awendo Green Stadium on Sunday as APS Bomet take on Vihiga Bullets at Bomet Grounds on Sunday.
