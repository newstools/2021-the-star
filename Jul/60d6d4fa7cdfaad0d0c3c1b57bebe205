The women's national basketball team coach George Mayienga believes the arrival of Kigali-based Georgia Odhiambo is a big boost to his game-plan as the Lionesses continue training for the FIBA Afro-Basket Zone Five qualifiers in Kigali, Rwanda on July 12-17. Odhiambo's arrival increases the foreign legion in the camp, including Spanish-based Mercy Wanyama and the US-based trio of Victoria Wanjara, Brenda Wasuda and Felmas Koranga. "The diaspora base players will be key to our performance in Rwanda. From what I am seeing, I expect the team to do well. They look sharp. I am happy that they are finally here. Because of their understanding of the game, their presence is vital to the team's progress," Mayienga said. The head coach is optimistic the girls will put a great show in Kigali and pointed to the fact that they are no injury worries as a sign of better things ahead. "Now that we are moving to camp, I will make use of that time to push their girls to give their best since there are only a few days left. Everybody is working hard to make the final team," he said. Meanwhile, the team will hit residential camp at Nyayo Stadium, Nairobi as the D-day approaches.Â  Moris Aluanga, the national team board member, said everything is set after deliberations with the Ministry of Sports. "We have finalised with the Ministry of Sports about the team's camping. So they will move to the hotel. As soon as they are through with today's (yesterday) sessions, they will go home pick their bags and head straight to the hotel until they travel," former KBF and FIBA Zone Five president said. Kenya will battle favourites Egypt and also the reigning champions, debutants South Sudan as well as host Rwanda and Burundi for the sole ticket to the regional festival. The finals are slated for Yaounde, Cameroon in September. So far, Cape Verde, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali and Mozambique have booked their tickets.
