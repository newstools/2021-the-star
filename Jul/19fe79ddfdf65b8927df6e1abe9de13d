The abandoned, substandard and dirty downtown lanes are undergoing rehabilitation as the Nairobi Metropolitan Services eyes ward-based projects starting this month. According to Major General Mohammed Badi lead team, major roads within the busy Central  Business District have been re-carpeted with the focus being on the lanes. “NMS is first doing major roads before we go into the estates. Not only have we done the roads but we are also working on the inner lanes,” he said. Badi explained that before NMS no single lane had been repaired with most of them being converted into the dumping area, a base for street boys and hawkers “The big problem in CBD is these inner lanes which were never repaired. But we are now doing all of them. We do not want to move outside CBD without completely re-carpeting the whole of it,” he said. The NMS boss is also optimistic that all road projects to have tarmacked roads within the city's informal settlements will be completed by mid next year. Noting the challenges, Badi says NMS capacity is limited due to the number of equipment available. “Remember construction equipment is very expensive and the budget we have cannot buy more than five pieces of equipment,” he said. Since its establishment, NMS has bought eight pieces of equipment and repaired almost five. Last September, NMS said it intends to speed up road repairs across the capital following the completion of a new asphalt (bitumen) plant on Kangundo Road. The plant can produce 2,400 tonnes of bitumen daily which is enough to recarpet three Kilometers of road. Nairobi has been relying on asphalt from a plant on Nanyuki Road in the Industrial Area which produces only 150 to 300 tonnes of asphalt a day. Already, NMS has re-carpeted several roads in Nairobi’s CBD including City Hallway, Moi Avenue, Wabera Street with Grogon and Kirinyaga Roads also nearing completion.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
