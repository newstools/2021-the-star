President Uhuru Kenyatta has ordered swift investigations into the murder of Kenyan environmentalist Joanna Stuchburry. In a statement on Friday, Uhuru condemned the killing and ordered security agencies to track down the perpetrators of the heinous act. Stuchburry, renowned for her relentless efforts to conserve the Kiambu Forest, was shot dead by unknown people on Thursday afternoon at her home. “My Government will pursue and apprehend the criminals behind the killing of Joanna. We will not allow few misguided individuals to continue shedding the blood of innocent people working hard to make Kenya a better place for all of us. Those are cowardly enemies of our country,” Uhuru said. The President said his administration greatly appreciates the contribution of  Stuchburry in conserving the environment. “It is very sad, unfortunate and regrettable that bad people have senselessly taken away the life of Joanna Stuchburry in such a senseless manner," he said. "For the longest time, Joanna has been a steadfast champion for the conservation of our environment and is remembered for her relentless efforts to protect Kiambu forest from encroachment." The Head of State promised Government action to track down and apprehend killers of Stuchburry terming them cowardly enemies of the Kenyan nation. The President prayed to God to give the family of Stuchburry strength and fortitude to bear the tragic loss of their loved one. Award-winning conservationist Paula Kahumbu broke the news on her social media pages, stating that Stuchburry was shot four times in her driveway at Mushroom Gardens Estate near Thindigua. "Stuchburry was shot dead this afternoon known for her relentlessly attempts to protect Kiambu forest from developers - she was shot four times in her driveway nothing was stolen. May she Rest in Eternal Peace. May the culprits be caught and punished," she said.
