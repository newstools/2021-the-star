The body of a missing electrician was found locked in his house in Kayole estate, Naivasha, after two days of search. A neighbour, Dan Kimani, said the body of the deceased who was living alone was found lying on his bed after they broke into his house. “He has been working in one of the construction sites and when he failed to report to duty for the second day we went to his house where we found that he had passed on,” Kimani said on Thursday. And in another incident, the body of a 25-year-old man was found hanging in his mother’s home in Nyondia village along the Naivasha-Kirima road. It’s suspected that the deceased who worked in Nairobi committed suicide after returning home due to harsh economic times. Tears flowed freely as relatives and friends tried to come to terms with the incident that occurred a day after the man arrived home. A witness, James Githinji, said that they were in the dark over the motive of the suspected suicide, adding that the deceased had not complained of anything when he arrived home. He said the man arrived home with all his personal effects and wares that he was trading in Nairobi before retiring to the parents’ home. “We were called in the morning only to find his body hanging from the roof and we suspect that he was depressed,” he said. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru confirmed both cases, adding that the bodies had been collected and inquest files opened. Edited by Henry Makori
