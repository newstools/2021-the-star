The Bundesliga and second-tier Bundesliga 2 will permit five substitutions per match in the 2021-22 season while away fans will be allowed to attend games from matchday three on August 27 , the German Football League (DFL) has said. Football’s law-making body IFAB gave competition organisers the option of allowing teams to continue using up to five substitutes per game until the end of 2022 and the DFL’s Extraordinary Members Assembly took up the option. Most matches last season were played without fans due to the Covid-19 pandemic — with away fans barred — and the DFL said matchday three was selected for their return as teams would need to get used to welcoming back crowds again. “For as long as spectator capacity is still subject to legal restrictions, five per cent of the tickets for each game are to be reserved for away fans,” the DFL said. “Once restrictions are lifted completely, there will be an automatic return to the intended contingent of 10 per cent.” The new Bundesliga season begins on August 13 with defending champions Bayern Munich playing away at Borussia Moenchengladbach.
