Deputy President William Ruto has hit out at opposition leader Raila Odinga, saying he should apologise to Kenyans for disrupting the Big Four Agenda after President Uhuru Kenyatta invited them into government. Speaking on Sunday while attending a church service at the Presbyterian Church of East Africa in Umoja, the DP said the Big Four would have created jobs for many young people in the country. "The President out of abundance of heart welcomed you to government and you came and disrupted the Big 4 agenda; it would have given jobs to plumbers, masons and you took us to a constitutional change." "You need to apologise to us and you need to be ashamed of yourselves," Ruto said. The Deputy President alleged some have been in government and stolen from young people. Ruto said they run cartels in government but pretend to give lectures on how to fight corruption. "Hawa watu ndugu zetu ni watu wa ajabu sana kwa sababu wakiwa kwa serikali walikuwa wanaibia vijana. Sasa wako kwa serikali wanaibia wagonjwa na covid billionaires," he said. This loosely translates to, "These people are full of wonders. When they were in government, they stole, now they are stealing from the poor like the Covid billionaires." The DP hit out at the opposition for claiming to run the government. "The irony of this thing is that it is only in Kenya where the opposition pretends to run the government," Ruto said. He went on to say that he has helped those complaining about his visits to fundraise for churches and helped low-income earning Kenyans gain powerful positions and no one complained when he did it. "Nataka niwaulize wawe wa kusema ukweli, mbona mnalalamika saa ile wengine wanapata kusaidika," the Deputy President said. The second in command had attended the Presbyterian Church of East Africa in Umoja, for a fundraiser for the construction of a youth church. DP Ruto highlighted the developments the Jubille government has made in the area, to improve the lives of residents of Eastlands.
