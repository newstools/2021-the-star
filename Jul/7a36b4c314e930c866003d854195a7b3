Migori Governor Okoth Obado has been told to resign from ODM and seek fresh mandate from the electorate. Makadara MP George Aladwa said Obado is still an ODM member despite his recent move to popularise People Democratic Party. “We don't have a problem and respect Obado’s decision to defect to PDP. He should resign officially and leave us alone,” the MP said on Tuesday. Aladwa said all leaders who have been elected on the ODM ticket should respect the party and if they want to work with other political outfits, they should resign and seek fresh mandate from the electorate. “His [Obado's] manoeuvre is a small matter that is not giving us sleepless nights,” the legislator said. He said the party will weed out MPs and MCAs who go to bed with rival parties. “We have elected leaders who, after being elected using our party ticket, decide to not only disrespect our party, but also our leader Raila Odinga. Loyalty and fidelity to the party and Raila will be our yardstick come 2022 General Election,” Aladwa said. He said the party has started mass registration of people and is strengthening its grassroots mobilisation by joining other parties such as Jubilee to ensure they form the next government. Aladwa was speaking in Migori town where he meet several ODM leaders led by county chairman Philip Makabong’o and secretary general Joseph Olala. Migori MCAs Graham Kagali of South Kanyamkago, Hevron Maira of Muhuru Bay and Kevins Keke of South Kamagambo were present. “We have decided to move on to strengthen the party in Migori without the governor and his supporters who are out to frustrate us. We respect their freedom to move,” Makabong’o said. Kagali said the party is stable and back on track. "There is a tsunami coming and our rivals will be swept away into political oblivion.” Edited by A.N
