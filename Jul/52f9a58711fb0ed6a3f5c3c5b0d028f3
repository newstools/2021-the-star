The Bodaboda Association of Kenya has urged the police to deal firmly with thugs  using motorbikes to commit crimes. Association chair Kelvin Mubadi on Wednesday said the persons committing the crimes are not their members, but criminals out to soil their reputation. “We will not accept our name to be tarnished and when we get hold of these criminals we will not hesitate to hand them over to the police,' Mubadi said. He added that police should arrest and arraign thieves using motorbikes to commit crime. The association rejected claims that boda boda operators  were collaborating with criminal gangs. He said the riders are making an honest living with their motorbikes. Mubadi said that 99 per cent of all motorcycles used in crime are not boda bodas. “Not all motorcycles are boda boda. Through my consultative meetings with boda boda operators across counties, I believe, trust and I can say that they are not involved in such crimes,” he said. The BAK condemned the criminals who have invaded the boda boda sector. Crimes linked to boda boda have become rampant across the country, especially in Nairobi. Numerous videos where gangs use motorbikes to commit crime have gone viral in social media. Mubadi said that motorcycles have become the easiest mode of transport in crime incidents because of their ability to manoeuvre in traffic unlike vehicles. “The gangs have gone back to purchase motorcycles and use them in crime. But a boda boda operator wakes up in the morning to go earn a living and is stationed at a particular stage,” he said. Mubadi said that all boda bodas should be registered under the Bodaboda Information Management System aimed at weeding out the criminals. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
