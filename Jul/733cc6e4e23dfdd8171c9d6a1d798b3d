Sheria Mtaani, legal lobby group, has appealed to stop Justice Jessie Lessit from concluding the Willie Kimani murder case. After Justice Lessit was promoted to the Court of Appeal in June, it appeared that the Kimani case would have to start afresh after five years. But last week Chief Justice Martha Koome instructed Lessit to complete the Willie Kimani case. Sheria Mtaani and its founder Shadrack Wambui then went to court arguing that an Appeal Court judge cannot hear a High Court matter and that the case should start again.

Kimani had filed a complaint against a senior policeman accused of shooting his client, a boda boda rider. Kimani was last seen at Syokimau police station. Four policemen are charged with his murder. It was a sensible decision by the CJ to let Lessit finish this case. No-one objected to Lessit before her proposed transfer. So this objection is purely procedural. 'Justice delayed is justice denied'. This case started in July 2016. It should be allowed to conclude with Lessit presiding.
