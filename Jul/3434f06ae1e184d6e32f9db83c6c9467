KCB squandered a 2-o lead to share spoils with Tusker in an evenly contested Football Kenya Federation Premier League match at Thika Stadium on Sunday. Tusker made the first inroad into their opponent's territory when Boniface Muchiri darted down the left channel past his markers before unleashing a rasping shot that sent Joseph Okoth into a full length save. An end to end game, Nashon Alembi threatened Tusker's goal seven minutes later after being put through by Michel Oduor but Hashim Sempala was swift enough to nip the attack in the bud. Derrick Otanga broke the deadlock in the 24th minute when he capitalised on Tusker custodian Robert Mboya's howler to put the bankers in the driving seat. Tusker head coach Robert Matano effected an early change in the 32nd minute when Faraj Ominde made way for Humphrey Mieno. The decision almost proved fruitful when Mieno and Kevin Okoth interchanged some crisp passes before setting up Sempala, who however, scooped the ball inches wide. In the 60th minute, KCB head gaffer Zedekiah Otieno introduced David Ambulu and Samuel Mwangi for Reagan Otieno and David Simiyu respectively, whereas Matano in a further change, brought on Eric Zakayo, Jackson Macharia and Chistopher Oruchum for Brian Marita, Genry Meja and Okoth. The changes eventually paid off, when Mieno pounced on a loose ball in the area to net the brewers first goal in the 81st minute. Then three minutes later, Macharia came on the end of Mieno's pinpoint pass to level the terms for the brewers. The results leave Tusker at the summit of the log with 51 points as KCB remain rooted in second with 47.
