Vote counting is underway in the Kiambaa by-election. Polling centres closed at 5.20pm. The contest has narrowed down to a two horse race pitying Jubilee's Kariri Njama and UDA's John Njuguna. Other candidates in the by-election include Richard Njoroge (The New Democrat Party), Isaac Karomo (Federal Party of Kenya), Willie Mbugua (Independent), David Mugo (Independent), Evans Wainaina (Independent) and Njoroge Harrison (Independent). The constituency has slightly more than 96,000 registered voters with 154 polling stations in five wards. There were blame games, propaganda and low turnout during Thursdayâ€™s polls. The polls are seen as a contest between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto. There was heavy police deployment across the constituency to avert possible chaos. Earlier, residents confronted National Assembly Majority Leader Amos Kimunya at Kimuga polling station during the start of voting. The angry residents claimed that Kimunya was not a voter nor an agent in the by-election.

The post by Moses Kuria is therefore a false allegation. #July15thByelections," IEBC said in a tweet.
