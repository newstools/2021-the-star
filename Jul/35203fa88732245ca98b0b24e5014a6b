A new office for Kinale assistant county commissioner will be built within three months, Lari MP Jonah Mburu has said. The legislator on Wednesday asked residents not to worry about how they will be served and from where. He said his CDF committee discussed the issue as urgent, and resolved to give the office priority, as government services have to go on without any hindrance. However, he did not disclose the amount of money that will be used. He said the office will not be residential but purely for providing services. “We shall build offices only. The block will not accommodate any officer's family. They will strictly be offices,” he said. The MP said police houses will also be built to accommodate all officers stationed at the Soko Mjinga police post. Former area councilor Titus Kiratu said the Kenya Forest Service had accepted to allocate one acre to the regional administration to build assistant county commissioner’s offices and a police post, after a request by the defunct Kiambu county council. “I was a member of the council when we requested KFS to allocate land where government offices can be built. It is now upon the current government to follow up on the land, build more offices and expand this station” Kiratu said. A police officer escaped unhurt on Wednesday after his house, which is next to ACC Karanja Kimata’s office, caught fire. He was woken up by residents who saw flames of fire billowing from the roof tops and rushed to put it out. “The officer was tired after a night of patrol. He had returned at dawn, just before the fire broke out,” resident Charles Nyoro said. Deputy county commissioner Agnes Karoki thanked residents for putting out the fire, adding that police have launched investigations to establish what really caused it. She also disclosed that even though the roof and ceiling were destroyed and the officer lost property and cash, nothing else was damaged. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
