Willie Kimani's murder case failed to resume on Thursday after the court was informed that a witness was bereaved and could not attend hearings. The prosecution told Justice Jessie Lessit that 44th witness Nicholas Ole Sena had lost his father and that the burial is set for Friday. Lessit allowed the adjournment and fixed the case for hearing on July 16 when Ole Sena will be in court. Ole Sena was stood down last year from the witness stand and has never concluded his testimony due to the many adjournments in the case. Last week, Justice Lessit said she will conclude hearing the matter even though she had been promoted to the Court of Appeal. In directions given in a virtual court, the judge said she had received written instructions from Chief Justice Martha Koome to conclude all her partly heard matters and pending judgements. She said this during the mention of Kimani’s case which has been pending since January when it was last mentioned in court. The case was to be heard every Thursday and Friday between July 8 and July 30. Last week, Kimani’s family pleaded with the Chief Justice to allow Lessit to conclude the matter. The judge will proceed with the hearing of the Kimani case from July 16 all through to July 30. Defence lawyer Cliff Ombeta, who had argued that Lessit has no mandate to hear any matter at the High Court after being sworn in as a Court of Appeal judge, did not oppose the directions. Ombeta said he wants to finalise the matter. Lessit has two more witnesses to hear including the one who had been stood down last year before the prosecution closes its case. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
