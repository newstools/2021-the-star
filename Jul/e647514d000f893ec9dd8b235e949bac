Tanzanian singer Diamond Platnumz is gearing up for his fourth album. He has been hanging out with international superstars. Diamond has been in the US for the past month after he attended the BET Awards. Among the superstars he has so far posted is legendary rapper Snoop Dogg, whom he shared a video with in the studio. "There are moments when you can't watch the numbers coz if you watch numbers you believe you fell off," Snoop Dogg told Diamond Platnumz. "You did not fall off. That's okay. You gotta work hard, there are people who want to be like you right now." He added that his music has changed people around him who were involved in the drug business. Diamond is also working with American stars Swae Lee, Akon, Wiz Khalifa, Swizz Beatz and Busta Rhymes.
