Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday met 227 MCAs from Mt Kenya region at his Karen official residence. The MCAs were taken through the UDA manifesto and the bottom-up economic model. The DP is set to unveil his economic blueprint in December. The Saturday meeting comes less than two weeks after he held a similar forum with MCAs from Baringo county. Last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta's camp suffered a blow after some of his staunch loyalists from his Central backyard joined Ruto's hustler nation. The surprise switch of at least eight politicians to Tangatanga is seen as a way to firm up Ruto's bid to turn the tables on Uhuru in Mt Kenya ahead of the 2022 polls. Kiambu Woman Representative Gathoni Wamuchomba jumped ship to Ruto's camp. Nakuru Town East David Gikaria and Githunguri MP Gabriel Kago also joined the hustler movement.
