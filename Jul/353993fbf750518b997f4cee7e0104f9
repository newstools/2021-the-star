Online betting firm, Odibets has come to the rescue of ailing former AFC Leopards star Ezekiel Otuoma. The footballer was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) sometime last year, a condition that now threatens to wreck all the gains he has made in his glittering football career as well as his future ambitions. The forward last featured for National Super League side, Talanta FC before the ailment struck and eventually weighed him down. And after his on and off trips to the hospital ran his pockets dry, Otuoma came out to seek financial help early this year. The local football fraternity immediately chipped in and embarked on a sustained social media campaign to appeal for financial aid. Fortunately, Odibets heeded the pleas and will now afford the ailing player the much-needed support through their Odi Mtaani initiative. The firm has pledged Sh1.5 million to cater for his treatment in Germany. Odibets further pledged to provide money for Otuoma's transport and support his wife's business venture. "In addition, we have also paid for the transport costs to Germany to a tune of Sh300,000 and a further Sh200,000 to support the wife’s business," said a communique released by Odibets. Odibets country manager, Aggrey Sayi said they had come to give a message of hope to the footballer 'who once graced our Kenyan grounds'. “Today we have visited Ezekiel to bring a message of hope to him and support him by paying his medical bill," said Aggrey Sayi. Early last month, Odibets under the Odimtaani initiative paid hospital bills for Harambee Stars goalkeeper Patrick Matasi and his family who had been involved in a road accident.
