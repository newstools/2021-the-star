Sprinters Mercy Oketch and Loice Morara are keen to follow in the footsteps of Mary Moraa when the World Under-20 trials get underway at Moi International Sports Center, Kasarani today (Thursday). The two upcoming sprinters want to launch their international career by sealing places in Team Kenya for the World Under-20 Championships. Moraa qualified to the 2020 Olympics two weeks ago and will be representing the country in the 800m. Oketch and Morara will both race in the 400m but the latter will double up in the 200m. Both athletes alongside Moraa are products of Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyanza South camp at Mogonga PAG in Kisii. “Moraa has inspired and mentored us. We are following in her footsteps and we want to represent country during the World Under-20,” said Oketch, the national secondary schools 400m champion. The East Africa secondary schools bronze medalist added: “We have trained with her and she has always encouraged us.” Morara, popularly known as Mzungu, echoed Oketch’s sentiments. “We have trained for the event and we are raring to go. We don’t want to let our coaches down,” said the athlete who has been training in Nairobi. The two, who spoke separately to the Star on Tuesday, remained cagey on whether they will also follow in Moraa’s footsteps and upgrade to the 800m race. “Time will tell but I cannot rule it out,” said Oketch while Morara said she will for now focus on sprints. Oketch and Moraa will be among a strong team of 50 from Nyanza South during this weekend's trials. They were selected during regional pre trials held at Kisii University a month ago. Nyanza South team manager Haron Onchong’a said they are targeting to enter 10 athletes in Team Kenya for World Under-20. “Our focus is on sprints and field events. However we have good middle and long distance athletes who can make it. In 2017, we had 10 athletes in Team Kenya for World Under-18 from Nyanza South and this time round, we also want to have the same number,” said Onchong’a.
