Gospel singer Size 8 has urged fellow musicians to stop using scandals and stunts to remain relevant. Speaking to Word Is, the mother of two said she is currently focused on serving God and is no longer following hype. "I still get endorsements and so on. I am just doing my work to serve God. You can still serve God purely and your brand stays up," she said. "You can stick to your lane and money will still come. I know I am not perfect." Last week, musician Willy Paul said Size 8 blocked him on Instagram and does not pick his calls. He shared a video of him trying to reach out to the singer but the number does not go through. Pozze then asked what wrong he did to the mother of two. Willy Paul and Size 8 were once close friends and even worked on a song together. Pozze said for the last four years, they have not talked. "I thought gospel is all about God, hii ni gani yenye we are blocking each other. Size 8 blocked me for no apparent reason. If you call yourself a servant of God then live according to that." Size 8 preaches at JCC Thika every Tuesday and Friday. "I am much into Godly things and rarely concentrate on what people are doing out here. I am praying so that the nation can heal from the current problems."
