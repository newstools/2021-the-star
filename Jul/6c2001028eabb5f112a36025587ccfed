The hotly contested parliamentary by-election in Kiambaa is about who will complete the work left by the late Paul Koinange, Senate Chief Whip Kimani Wamatangi has said. The by-election scheduled for July 15 comes in the final year of the current Parliament and the last budget before the next election in August 2022. Wamatangi who is the Kiambu senator said it will be difficult for the new MP to come up with fresh projects, since those already passed are factored by this year’s budget. Wamatangi said the new MP's task will be to follow up and complete the projects which Koinange started. “There will be no possibility for someone to change anything especially this being the final budget before we go to the next general election,” Wamatangi said. He spoke on Saturday when he made an impromptu tour of Kiambaa. The senator who is campaigning for Jubilee Party candidate Kariri Njama urged residents to take time to listen to those seeking the seat and analyse them. “All these candidates are our people. The most honourable thing is to listen to all these aspirants' visions, plans and knowledge about our constituency. We need someone who will complete the projects that had been awarded funds and those which were ongoing,” Wamatangi said. The senator asked Kiambaa residents to maintain peace and exercise tolerance ahead of the poll. Njama and his UDA competitor Njuguna Wanjiku have intensified their campaigns. Other candidates include Richard Njoroge and Evans Gichia. All the candidates have promised that they will complete Koinange’s projects and they know where they are. Koinange died on March 31. Voters in Muguga ward in Kabete constituency will also elect their MCA on the same day. The seat fell vacant after Eliud Ngugi died on March 16. “So far so good, even if the campaigns are so hot, we have not heard of any incident or riots, threats, fights or other ugly scenarios,” Wamatangi said.
