A 35-year-old matatu driver was found dead in a 10-foot pit latrine after he went missing on Sunday in Kasipul constituency. The body of Mathew Amondi was found inside a latrine in Aolo village, North Kamagak. The driver went missing on Sunday evening after work. He was operating a Kisumu-Kisii bound matatu. “A bad ordour was emanating from the latrine and when we went to check, we found the body. The body had started to decompose,” a resident said. It was reported that the driver had communicated with his wife on the phone earlier in the day. North Kamagak senior chief Benson Midigo said the man even sent money to his wife by phone. “The money he sent was for shopping. He also told his wife that he was going to a place he did not disclose,” Midigo said. The administrator said the family of the driver realised Amondi was missing when he could not be reached on the phone. His wife and friends tried to call him, but his phone was switched off. Kasipul police commander Lilies Wachira said an investigation into the death has been launched. She said they will question some of the driver's family members and people he was working with. Wachira said the disappearance of the driver had not been formally reported to the police. “We’re asking the family and friends to cooperate, so the investigation process is expedited. Let residents remain proactive by reporting missing people to police first,” Wachira said. The body was taken to Rachuonyo South Subcounty Hospital mortuary.
