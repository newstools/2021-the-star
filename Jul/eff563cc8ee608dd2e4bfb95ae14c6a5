Should the country have held the referendum to determine the fate of the Building Bridges Initiative by now, the majority of supporters who would vote for it are from ODM, according to the research carried out by the TIFA. TIFA released its findings on Thursday which covered the support for any Constitutional changes, knowledge of the BBI report contents, reported participation in the BBI process, expressed BBI referendum voting intention, and main reasons. Its opinion also covered the perceived main motivations for BBI reforms by president Uhuru Kenyatta, and ODM leader Raila Odinga, the support for minimum reforms by Parliament if BBI does not go forward, and the perceived likelihood of having a BBI referendum before the 2022 election. From its findings, ODM party supporters would have voted for the Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020, with a majority of 59 per cent while 13 per cent would vote against it. The findings also revealed that only 25 per cent of the ruling Jubilee Party would vote for the bill to amend the Constitution compared to 31 per cent who would vote against it. Also, 11 per cent of the Jubilee supporters are undecided whether to vote for it or against the bill, and 16 per cent would not participate in the voting process. Only 9 per cent of the United Democratic Alliance UDA which is associated with Deputy President William Ruto would have voted for the bill, while 57 per cent would vote NO. Six per cent of UDA supporters are undecided whether to vote YES/NO, compared to 19 per cent of its follower who would have refrained from the process. The outcome comes as the Court of Appeal continues to hear the case challenging the ruling of the High Court which overturned the BBI process, terming it unconstitutional. The court enters day three on Thursday, with the respondent trying to convince the seven-judge bench of the Court of Appeal to uphold the ruling of the High Court.
