Majority of Kenyans believe that ODM party leader Raila Odinga supports BBI to increase his chances of being the president in 2022, a poll has found. The TIFA poll released on Thursday indicates that 50 percent of the population believe he is supporting the initiative to increase his chances of becoming president. The research was done on 1,500 respondents on June 24 to 28, 2021. The study had a margin error of +/- 2.53 percent. But 13 percent said he is supporting BBI to encourage or build national unity. This was followed by 3 percent who said he wants to fix or correct certain errors in the Constitution. Thirty percent were not sure. However, since the BBI initiative begun, Raila has not indicated his interest in becoming the president in 2022. Last week he mentioned that the formation of a heavy political machine is in the works. The formation, which he said will transform into a “tsunami”, will sweep the country in next year’s general election. “There is a strong wind coming. It is heavy. It will turn into a tsunami. That is why I want our people to know that we know where we are going.” “We want our people to know that the machine we are making is a heavy one. You see others chest-thumping, they are passing wind,” he added.
