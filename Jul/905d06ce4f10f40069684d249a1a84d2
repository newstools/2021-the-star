Deputy President William Ruto has said that the era of choosing leaders based on tribal alliances is gone. The DP said it is time for Kenyans to assess, scrutinise, evaluate, and choose their representatives according to their development agendas. “It is time for Kenyans to assess, scrutinize, evaluate and choose between development agendas now in the public domain and not tribal alliances,” Ruto said. Ruto said the shift to a political conversation based on the economy instead of ethnicity has started to take root in the country, saying it is a most welcome move. Speaking on Tuesday at the Africa Inland Church-Milimani in Nairobi, Ruto said that the current panic in Kenya’s political arena is as a result of his dedication to empowering ordinary Kenyans. He noted that some politicians have been profiting from people’s poverty and unemployment. “That is why the Big Four plan was sabotaged because it promised a better future for ordinary people,” Ruto said. He added that instead of paying attention to the Big Four that guaranteed jobs to millions of Kenyans, the said leaders were focused on the review of the Constitution. “When you see a leader complaining that a poor person has been given a tool of the trade like a wheelbarrow, then there is a problem.” He pledged to intensify his plans to empower Kenyans through the bottom-up, middle-out economic model.
