Belgium vs Italy, Friday 22:00 Having lost at the quarter-finals of the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016, Belgium finally cleared this hurdle at the 2018 World Cup. Belgium have shown real development under boss Roberto Martínez, as no European nation has won more games (47) and scored more goals (175) than Belgium since Martínez took over. Mancini’s inspired substitutions got the job done against Austria, with another clean sheet in 90 minutes taking Italy’s current streak to 12 within regulation time. Arriving in their fourth successive European Championship quarter-final, a win would result in a fifth consecutive European Championship victory for the Italians. Averaging 21.8 shots per game—a tournament high after the Round of 16—while facing only seven shots themselves, shows Italy have been at their best. In fact, they’ve only conceded 13 goals across their last 18 matches at major tournaments, keeping eight clean sheets, and conceding more than once on only one occasion.

Confidence should therefore be high, especially as their last H2H win against Denmark came at this very stage of the Euros back in 2004, while they also won the only other meeting at these championships in 2000. The Czechs became the first team since at least 1980 to deny the Netherlands a single shot on target at the Euros, and another solid defensive performance is possible here, as they are yet to concede over 1.5 goals in four games during this edition - the first time playing as the Czech Republic that they’ve achieved that. Denmark have reached this stage for the first time since 2004, after registering their first knock-out win at this tournament since their surprise triumph in 1992. Their 4-0 victory over Wales was their second consecutive match at the Euros to see them score 4+ goals, and only their third such match in history.

Scoring two goals in three of their four Euro 2020 matches, Ukraine’s attack could again be heavily relied upon here as after conceding against Sweden, Andriy Shevchenko’s side have kept just three clean sheets across their last 19 internationals. More positively though, since late 2018, Ukraine boast a solid record against sides currently ranked in Fifa’s top ten. England booked a third quarter-final spot from their last four Euro appearances courtesy of a 2-0 win over Germany at Wembley, in what was their first knock-out victory over the Germans since the 1966 World Cup final. That result gave Gareth Southgate’s men a fourth clean sheet in a row at Euro 2020, making England only the second side in Euro history to not concede in any of their opening four games. That victory further extended the Three Lions’ unbeaten run to ten internationals, whilst they’ve lost just twice to opposition currently ranked worse than Ukraine since a H2H defeat back in October 2009. Concern here will instead come from a lack of goalscoring, as England’s four goals netted at Euro 2020 is the lowest return from any side left in the competition.
