Carrefour Supermarket is expanding its retail footprint across the country with the upcoming opening of two new stores in Kisumu county. The two stores will be located at United Mall and Market MEGA, adopting the hypermarket and supermarket models respectively. "The opening of the two stores will create direct and indirect job opportunities to over 200 Kisumu residents," Country Manager Franck Moreau said during a courtesy meeting with governor Anyang’ Nyong’o. "This would take form through the direct and indirect employment, expanded supply opportunities for local farmers and manufacturers, and a wider market choice for customers." Moreau said the stores will open in July and August respectively. The stores will offer upon opening a convenient assortment, focusing on fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) at Carrefour prices. "Our continuous commitment to contribute towards the Kenyan economy is reflected in the increase of job opportunities for local communities where we operate," he said. " As a true testament to uplifting those around us, more than two hundred Kisumu residents will benefit from the opening of the two stores through direct and indirect employment.” The opening of the two stores will raise the total number of Carrefour outlets in Kenya to 15, including 11 stores in Nairobi and two in Mombasa. Early in the year, Carrefour Kenya opened its 12th store in Nairobi at the Westgate Mall in Westlands. The new store will serve residents of Westlands, Parklands and the larger Thigiri area. The Westgate store will also introduce several digital services such as shopping delivery, or “Valet trolley” which will give customers the chance to shop and have their goods ready for collection at the store. This follows the recent Carrefour openings in Kwale County at Diani Centre Point Plaza and at the Nextgen mall, along Mombasa road in Nairobi.
