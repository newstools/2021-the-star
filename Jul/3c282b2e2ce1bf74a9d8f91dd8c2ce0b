St Anne’s Nyangoge will represent Nyanza region at the national under 20 girls' rugby championship scheduled for Bomet University on July 17 and 18. The Saints, coached by former Nyanza region Kenya Rugby Union development officer Laban Bosire, thrashed Rianyanchabera Mixed Secondary 31-0 in a one-sided game held at Cardinal Otunga High School, Mosocho in Kisii County on Saturday. Team captain Marvel Laura led by example touching down twice with Margaret Wangare also scoring two tries. Sandra Kerubo added the fifth try with Linda Kagweria scoring two penalties for the winners. “Our advantage over Rianyanchabera is that our school is a boarding institution which allows us to train continuously. We have been training since 2017 when we introduced the game and it is now the most popular game,” said Bosire. He added: “I’m looking forward to the nationals where I expect the girls to excel. Currently, I have six girls in the national under-19 team. I want more to join the under-20 team.” Bosire thanked the school’s administration for supporting the rugby programme. St Anne's captain Laura said she is targeting to play for the national women’s team, Lionesses at international level. “We are working hard ahead of nationals and our target is to represent Kenya at the Olympics in 2024,” said a confident Laura. Rianyachabera coach and  Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Nyanza region development officer, Joseph Okong’o conceded defeat saying his girls gave their best. “We started serious training two weeks ago and most of my girls are  in Form One and Two. We shall come back stronger next year,” added Okong’o. He added that Koru and Aluor Girls who were expected for the Nyanza region championship did not turn up.According to Kenya Rugby Union development coordinator Ronald Okoth, KRU’s nine districts will field teams at the national under 20 championships at Bomet University. “We want to start preparing the selected athletes for the 2024 Olympics,” he said.
