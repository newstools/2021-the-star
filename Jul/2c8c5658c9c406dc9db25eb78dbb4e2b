Detective Anne Wanjiru Waiganjo who collapsed and died on Saturday at Baita Restaurant in Upper Hill had a blood clot in the left leg, an autopsy has shown. Chief government pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor said the blood clot in Waiganjo's left leg affected her heart functions and caused her death. “She had deep vein thrombosis, which led to pulmonary embolism, a clot in the pulmonary artery,” Dr Oduor said. Waiganjo was the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations unit in Karen. She had attended a farewell party for outgoing Makadara DCIO Henry Kiambati when the incident occurred. She is set to be buried on Friday at her Karatina home in Nyeri, her colleagues said. Deep vein thrombosis occurs when a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins in one’s body, usually in legs. Pulmonary embolism, which killed Waiganjo, is a potentially life-threatening complication associated with deep vein thrombosis. According to her colleagues, who were present, Waiganjo had complained of chest pains shortly before collapsing. Anne was the younger sister of Joshua Waiganjo, who was arrested in January 2013 after allegedly posing as an assistant commissioner of police for five years. The courts acquitted him of impersonation and other charges. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
