Ngoche siblings were the star attractions as the NPCA 50 Overs league entered the second week in Nairobi on Sunday. Shem Ngoche capitalised on a turning wicket to lead Stray Lions to six wickets win over hosts Ngara Sports Club while his elder brothers, James and Nehemiah, combined well with the bat and bowl as Swamibapa opened their 2021 campaign with a 99 runs win over Ruaraka. After losing the toss, the left arm spinner Shem created an illusion of turn with four wickets that enabled the visitors to bowl out the home team for 133 in 35.5 overs on their way to their second successive win. Shem (4 for 19) picked up four wickets in his first three overs to reduce the hosts to 52 for after 15.1 overs. However, Ngara innings was rebuilt by the skipper (15 not out) and Tanzeel Sheikh (43), who got them to 127 for 8 before new signing, Gerald Mwendwa, bagged his second with the dismissal of Sheikh in the 31st over. Mwendwa added on his third an over later to register 3 for 22. With the bat, Ngoche continued from where he had left in the opening match against Ruaraka, scoring unbeaten 42 as Stray Lions sealed the victory in 26.5 overs. Krishna Babu (20), Garry Chirumuuta (37) and Neil Mugabe had laid the foundation for the chase before Ngoche got onto the wicket with the board on 89 after 21 overs. “I’m once again delighted with my performance. I realized that the wicket was giving much help and so I decided to come in early and I am glad it worked for me,” Shem said. At Ruaraka, James bagged five wickets as Swanibapa bowled the home team for 114 in their quest for 213. At 89 for 4, Ruaraka were on course to get the total but the introduction of James destroyed their hopes as he cleared the middle order easily to claim 5 for 13. Earlier Nehemiah top-scored with 59 of 82 balls as Swamibapa posted 213 with four balls to spare. He put on an eighth wicket stand of 61 with James (29) and that lifted them to 209 for 8.
