Media personality Dickson Ngibuini, alias DNG, will run for the Woodley-Kenyatta Golf Course MCA seat. Declaring his bid, he said he did not vie in 2017 because at the time the ruling party had nothing to offer the youth. The former gospel artiste has lately been sensitising the youth on leadership and governance issues via his initiative, 'Who's Your Leader?' "Everyone I have interacted with has been telling me I have massive leadership potential. Many have told me I need to get into leadership. Others have told me I need to vie for an elective position," he said. "Despite having been involved in presidential elections and civic education thrice, I never had the interest to vie." Disillusioned with the ruling party in 2017, DNG launched a youth initiative, Hustle Yako, and supported other civic education campaigns, such as Jiactivate, Next Generation, Kura Yako Chaguo Lako and My Voice Counts. "I then set up my NGO: 254 Cares, where Hustle Yako is domiciled. I, thereafter, unveiled the Punguza Initiative and most recently, Who's Your Leader? Initiative," he said. He says he targets more young people to get into elective politics. "My goal is to get more young people excited about voting and participating in civic and political processes. The reason is simple: The change we seek is not going to come across miraculously. We have to work for it." Speaking to Word Is a few months ago, DNG said he regrets being part of TNA's campaign. "I supported UhuRuto in 2013. I campaigned for them under the TNA banner, 'I Believe'," he said. This was a movement by youth for youth that put forward the notion that Kenya can be better with young people in power. "But they have failed Kenyans. I criticise them today because I expected them to be better. I know what they promised Kenyans. I was there, in a branded T-shirt, hosting the rallies and roadshows and passionately selling their manifesto."
