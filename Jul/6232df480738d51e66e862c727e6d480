Operations, including learning, will resume at the Kisumu National Polytechnic on Monday next week after a 14-day closure. The institution was closed last month for 14 days after learners went on a rampage to protest against the management's decision to call off student elections. According to the school management, the Kisumu National Polytechnic Students Association (Kinaposa) elections were called off over Covid-19 fears. Elections will now be held on July 14. “The polytechnic is hereby closed with immediate effect for 14 days following the containment of the situation witnessed today, June 25, 2021,” the memo read. “This was as a result of the postponement of the student’s Kinaposa elections following the review of the Covid-19 containment measures issued by the Ministry of Health on June 18, 2021.” In another memo dated July 11, chief principal Catherine Kelonye said the decision to reopen the institution was made by the governing council. She said Kinaposa elections will be held electronically on July 14. The exercise will be conducted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. "You are required to pay attention to the scheduled outline and report to your respective heads of department for guidance pertaining to the ongoing academic programmes," the memo said. Kelonye urged students to avoid gatherings and observe all Covid-19 protocols. Edited by A.N
