Kahawa blanked Generations 37-21 in a national handball league tie at Nyayo National Stadium yesterday. The winners, up 17-11 at the breather, did enough to pull away for good as the self-supporting Generations applied the pressure to turn the tables in vain. Kahawa, who were humiliated 36-19 by Strathmore University the previous day, had 5 goals a piece from Moses Macharia, Rabin Isaac and Hassan Kubisa. The losers had the game’s highest scorer in Celesrus Okoyana, who shot 8 while Derick Odhiambo and Ian Wanjala provided four each. In another match, Rangers' Stephen Chemasuret nailed 11 goals but it only helped his team to 33-33 deadlock against Thika. They led 21-19 at half-time. Thika did well to humble Tigers 45-39 in another match as Rangers pipped Kenyatta University 30-27 in a hard-fought encounter. In the women’s match, Joan Onyinwa provided nine goals as she led Rangers to a 26-21 triumph over Amazon who had 4 each from Sarah Gitau and Prisa Chebet.
