Lawyer Cliff Ombeta has asked the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to give rogue officer, Corporal Caroline Kangogo time to surrender. Kangogo is believed to be on a killing spree after allegedly killing a police officer in Nakuru and another man in Juja, on Tuesday. In a tweet on Wednesday, Ombeta called on the DCI to assure her of fair treatment and access to justice once she surrenders. ""Uncork' your weapons and blood thirsty attitude so that we avoid extrajudicial killings. She definitely will have a story. Ask public to avoid mob justice if spotted," Ombeta said. He, however, did not disclose whether he would represent the officer if she surrenders. Kangogo, is the suspect behind the killing of Police Constable John Ogweno, in Nakuru and a man identified as Peter Ndwiga Njiru, in Juja. On Tuesday, DCI warned the public to be on the lookout, stating that Kangogo who is armed and dangerous has been on the run since early Monday morning, after she killed Ogweno, who was based in Nakuru. "We are cautioning members of the public especially men to be on the lookout for the rogue officer, who is luring men to her trap before executing them in cold blood." "Let nobody trust her since she is armed and dangerous. Should you spot the suspect who is covering herself in a buibui, do not hesitate to contact us through our toll free line 0800722203," DCI said. According to DCI, the rogue officer took off with Ogwenoâ€™s firearm, a loaded Ceska pistol.
