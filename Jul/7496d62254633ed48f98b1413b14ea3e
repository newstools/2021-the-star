The Kiambu county government has promised to increase water connectivity in the region from 54 per cent to 85 per cent in under three years. Governor James Nyoro made the promise on Saturday, while commissioning a water project at Number Kumi village in Kiambaa constituency. He said Number Kumi residents can now enjoy access to safe and reliable water supply. Nyoro said the water is expected to serve over 1,000 villagers. Residents will be getting the commodity at least five days a week. Water executive David Kuria said they are providing water through gravity to avoid electricity bills. He said the county government has lined up other water supply projects in Kiambaa subcounty. They include drilling of additional boreholes and rehabilitation of surface water sources such as the Kambaa-Karia springs and the Gathiri springs in Thimbigua. Resident Patrick Kamau said they are happy with the effort by the county government to ensure all residents access clean water. He said most villagers have dug boreholes, but the water is not safe since many homes use pit latrines, which might contaminate the water. Cianda MCA Philip Mubea, who is also the Kiambu county assembly deputy speaker, said crucial projects like installing water had stalled due to lack of money in the county coffers. He said the county government factored water installation in the budget to alleviate residents' suffering. "Residents can now instal water into their homes at a subsidised cost,” Mubea said. He said the water being distributed in the area was tapped from Tigoni dam. “The area had no water, and we were able to secure water pipes and tapped water from Tigoni dam,” Mubea said. Edited by A.N
