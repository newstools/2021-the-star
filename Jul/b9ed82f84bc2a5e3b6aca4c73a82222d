Modern Coast Rangers will today host Silibwet Leons on Friday at Serani grounds as they seek to continue to rise from relegation zone. Rangers lie 16th on the log with 28 points from 26 matches. However, the Mombasa-based team have played one more game than fellow relegation strugglers Kisumu Hot Stars, Mt Kenya United, Coast Stima and Soy United. Modern Coast Rangers assistant coach Ahmed Said says their target is to survive relegation. Fourth-placed Shabana have a tricky tie against eighth-placed Mully Children’s Family (MCF) at Thika Stadium on Saturady and are hoping to move into the top three. However, Shabana coach Robert Ojienda is worried about his team’s defensive fragilities. “We have lost about 10 points in the recent past due to lapse in concentration in the last 10 minutes of the games. It is a big problem but we have tried to address the problem in the last one week,” added Ojienda. He said the team’s promotion push is still on course. “The league remains very competitive but I’m confident I will guide the team to the Kenya Premier League. We have a tough game against MCF but we are equal to the task,” said Ojienda. Over the weekend, Shabana were awarded a walkover after Kisumu Hot Stars failed to show up at Narok Stadium for their game while MCF battled to a 2-2 draw with Migori Youth. In other games scheduled for Saturday, log leaders Talanta FC will hope to extend their lead on top of the log when they battle Murang’a Seal at St Sebastian Park in Murang’a County while second-placed Kenya Police and Nairobi Stima will clash  at Ruaraka Grounds. At Kianyaga Stadium in Kerugoya, Fortune Sacco will play Administration Police Service FC Bomet. Five games have been postponed following the suspension of sports activities in Nyanza and Western regions. The postponed games are Migori Youth vs Coast Stima, Kisumu Hot Stars vs Mwatate United, Kisumu All Stars vs Kibera Black Stars, Vihiga Bullets vs Mt Kenya United and Gusii FC vs Soy United.
