More than 15 members of Nakuru County Assembly have endorsed ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi to vie for the presidency in 2022. During a meeting held at a Nakuru Hotel on Saturday evening, the MCAs drawn from different parties among them Jubilee and ODM said they will support the candidature of Mudavadi based on his blueprint of reviving the economy. The MCAs said they were also impressed by his being a face of peace. Led by majority leader Moses Ndungu and deputy majority whip Wahome Jambo, the MCAs vowed to advance Mudavadi's agenda of reviving the economy and uniting all communities living in the cosmopolitan County. MCAs had earlier presented a list of issues they want to be addressed by Mudavadi once he becomes president among them, high taxes and laws that have made importation of goods for SMEs difficult. They also urged him to deal with the high unemployment in the county and encourage the creation of small industries to spur a production economy. The MCAs observed that many household essentials including cooking gas have increased following the signing into law of the Finance Bill 2021. “Our endorsement is out of realisation that Kenya's economy needs someone who understands it,” Ndungu said. While winding his two-day tour in Nakuru on Sunday, Mudavadi said that the 2022 general election should be conducted within the timeliness set out in the Constitution. Speaking at the Cathedral of Christ the King Catholic Church in Nakuru, Mudavadi said the elections should be held not later than September 2022. Mudavadi warned the government from altering the set dates, saying that it will be tantamount to clawing back on the gains of the 2010 Constitution. "Kenyans should be governed according to the law which should apply in all aspects," said Mudavadi
