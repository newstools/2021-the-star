LSK president Nelson Havi could face assault charges after he allegedly injured CEO Mercy Wambua at their Gatanga Road-based offices during a meeting on Monday. A police report at Muthangari station under OB number is 34/12/7/2021 shows Wambua reported her right arm and finger were hurt during a scuffle that erupted during the heated meeting. Speaking to Star, Wambua said she and the council had a meeting convened both physically and virtually. Upon learning that Havi and team had converged at the board room, she said she joined them but was met by shouts that she was a stranger, and had to leave. "He was there with legitimate council members allied to him as well as a team calling themselves caretaker members. Other legitimate council members joined online," she said. When she sat down, opened her laptop and refused to leave, she claimed, the president rose up and charged at her, slamming her laptop shut and shoving her. "I missed slap from him by a whisker," Wambua said. In the melee, she said, she had her arm and finger injured. The meeting had to be stopped as she left to report the matter to the police. By the time the Star reached her, she was still at the hospital doing an X-ray and other medical examinations. " I have also filled the P3 form for further police action," she added. Wambua and Havi have had a long running tussle after Havi declared her sacked in October last year. However, she refused to budge. Havi alleged Wambua was part of the team that had embezzled the society's money. The council of 13 had however voted 9-4 to clear her of any wrong doing and reinstated her. Efforts to obtain a comment from Havi failed as he did not pick calls.
