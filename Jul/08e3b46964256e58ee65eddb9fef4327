The Nairobi County Assembly Women Caucus has urged the government to deploy adequate security personnel in the city to curb crime. Kidnappings, muggings and robberies have increased in the city centre and estates. Led by chairperson Doris Kanario, the women legislators on Friday said the trend is affecting people's socio-economic status and their mental health. “Muggings, robberies and kidnappings in Nairobi are on the rise and happening in broad daylight. This must be addressed,” she said. “The victims have been left with physical abuse, sexual abuse, being killed, psychological abuse, confinement, isolation and being drugged,” Kanario said. The crimes have instilled fear among residents of Nairobi, disrupted social peace, and reduced economic investments. The MCAs said the loss of income owing to the Covid-19 pandemic should not be used as an excuse to terrorise people. Nominated MCA Elizabeth Nyambura said cases of missing children were worrying. “Several families are in pain while searching for their loved ones. Worse still is the trauma that comes to the victims and those around them,” she said. The women hope the anti-mugging squad that was recently formed will smoke out the muggers and thieves. The anti-mugging unit began patrolling the CBD in May this year. The unit is also patrolling Uhuru Highway after motorists complained of being harassed and robbed when stuck in traffic, especially late in the evening. The road has been experiencing traffic jams due to construction of the Nairobi Expressway. The MCAs are also advocating strengthening the Child Protection Unit within the government to focus on the detection and prevention of crime against children. They also want gender-based violence prevention and response programmes prioritised. The women leaders urged agencies in the administration of criminal justice in partnership with non-state actors to undertake community awareness and sensitisation through public forums and media platforms.
