Simbas' head coach Paul Odera breathed a huge sigh of relief as his charges advanced to the final round of World Cup qualifiers with 45-8 win over Zambia The Kenya Simbas were on the verge of missing out on qualification after a shock 20-19 defeat to Senegal last weekend but coach Odera was happy with the outcome. “The boys played their hearts out, executed well on attack and defence and there was desire to correct the wrongs of last week,” he added. Odera was delighted with the set piece and rush defence as they frustrated the Zambians in every facet of play. “With that intensity going forward, we can’t drop our standards anymore. We will look for more games to build consistency and combinations. Remember we have not played in almost two years so the more games we play, the better for us as we chase the dream to qualify for the World Cup in 2023 in France,” he noted. Senegal top the standings with eight points with Kenya second on six points. Zambians are third with no point. Fijian-born utility back Jone Kubu led the line scoring a brace with Dan Sikuta ,George Nyambua and Darwin Mukidza scoring a try each. Kubu added four conversions and Dominic Coullson added a penalty as the hosts led 32-3 at the interval. Meanwhile, the Kenya U-20 side retained the Barthes Cup with a hard fought 21-20 win over Madgascar. They led 13-12 at the interval. Coach Curtis Olago saluted his charges for showing character in the entertaining match. Chipu will now play at in the Junior Rugby World Trophy next year having thrashed Senegal 50-3 in their opening match.
