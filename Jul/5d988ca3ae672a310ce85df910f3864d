Kenya Lionesses are in upbeat mood as the FIBA Africa women’s Zone 5 qualifiers tips off in Kigali, Rwanda today. The team arrived safely and will go into the four-team tournament well aware that only the winners will book the sole ticket to the FIBA Afro-Basket show slated for Yaounde, Cameroon on September 17-26. After finishing runners up to Egypt in Kampala, Uganda in 2019, Lionesses are hoping to go one better this time round and head coach George Mayienga said his charges are ready. “We had our training session and got a feeling of the court. Egypt and South Sudan have tall players but we will be ready for them,” he said. With Uganda, Eritrea, Burundi and Ethiopia having pulled out, Kenya will have to go full throttle from their opening game. The tactician revealed he will take every game seriously and will rely on the exploits of his five oversea-based players and the local mix for results. He said that Felmas Koranga, who was named the best rebounder in Kampala, will be given limited minutes in every quarter so that she doesn’t aggravate her injury. “She remains key to my plans but I will not give her many minutes in every quarter. I need to keep her free of injury throughout the games.” Rose Ouma will lead the side that will also rely on Mercy Wanyama, Victoria Reynolds and Brenda Adhiambo. Ouma said she is convinced the team will do well in the show since they have a mixture of young and experienced players. “It is advantageous to have experienced players in the team because it is a good blend for success,” she said. Speedy Melissa Akinyi, Natalie Akinyi, Velma Achieng and Georgia Adhiambo and the lanky Christine Akinyi will also have big roles to play.
