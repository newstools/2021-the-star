Mr Seed's wife Nimo has denied bleaching her face. In an Instagram video, curious fans noticed her face was lighter than the rest of her body. "Am I crazy? If I wanted to bleach I would have started with my hands," she said. "You better look at my hands, I have like a birthmark. It separates; on this side, I have lighter skin tone, and on the other side, it's darker. And my mum is exactly this way. If you have a problem my friend, it's not your problem." After the rant, Nimo posted a picture of her mum to prove the point. She also shared her TBT pictures to show she hasn't changed her skin tone. She added that the comments and have been disturbing her and that is why she decided to clear the air.
