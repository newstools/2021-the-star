South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga to serve as Acting President as he prepares to visit Zambia, ahead of the State Funeral Burial for the late President Kenneth Kaunda. The announcement was made on Friday. According to the statement from the office of the president, the appointment comes following treatment of the Deputy President David Mabuza. Mabuza is currently receiving medical treatment in Russia. Kaunda succumbed to pneumonia in June at the of 97. Kaunda led Zambia into independence from Britain and went on to rule the country from 1964 to 1991. He joined the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress in 1951 as one of the people fighting for independence from the British. Eight years later, he broke away and founded the Zambian African National Congress, which was banned and resurfaced as the United National Independence Party, of which he was the leader. Kaunda will be buried next week at a private ceremony for family and invited guests.
