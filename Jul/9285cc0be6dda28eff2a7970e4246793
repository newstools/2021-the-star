Kenya Lionesses face Madagascar on Saturday in an international friendly match at Nyayo Stadium. This will be the hosts’ first match in two years after last year’s international test calendar was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Lionesses last played in the Africa Cup, which was acting as Rugby World Cup qualifiers, in 2019 in South Africa The Malagasy outfit arrived on Wednesday evening alongside their Under 20 team who will play Senegal in the Barthes Cup. Lionesses head coach Felix Oloo welcomed the encounter as ideal build-up for the repechage game against Colombia later in the year or early next year. “We have not played a test game in two years. The girls have been training hard and we are delighted to finally play a match,” he added. Oloo expects Malagasy outfit to be competitive and fast. “They are slick and quick in the backs. We will have to build our play and strength in the forwards and aim to dominate and deny them the ball,” added Oloo. He said the some of the playing squad will do duty for the Sevens side at the Tokyo Olympics later in the month and the match will be an added advantage. Oloo said he was optimistic the side will qualify for next year’s Rugby World Cup in New Zealand despite the lack of tests matches for the girls. “Our eyes remain on the prize of the World Cup. The girls are relishing the match despite the Covid-19 challenges.” The highlight of the day will be the Rugby World Cup qualifiers pitting the Simbas against Senegal at the same venue from 4pm
