The court has temporarily halted the swearing-in of Anne Kananu as Nairobi governor pending an appeal filed by human rights activist Okiya Omtatah and former Governor Mike Sonko. Court of Appeal judges Wanjiru Karanja (presiding), Jessie Lessit and Jamila Mohammed said the order will remain in force until October 22 when further directions in the case will be issued. In the appeal, Sonko argues that the High Court failed to evaluate his evidence and showed open bias while dismissing his case. The open bias, Sonko argues, was displayed when the High Court failed to assess his evidence and objections to his impeachment as Nairobi governor both in the county assembly and in the Senate. On June 24, Justices Said Chitembwe, Wilfrida Okwany and Weldon Korir ruled that the nomination, vetting and swearing-in of Kananu as deputy governor was done within the law. The three-judge bench upheld the decision by both the Nairobi county assembly and Senate to impeach Sonko. “They fully complied with the Constitution. We do not see any external hand in his impeachment," they ruled. Edited by A.N
