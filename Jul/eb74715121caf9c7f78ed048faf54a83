Kenya Airways PLC  has launched its Time to Think service that offers customers additional time before they make payments for their bookings. Customers will be able to book their flight and place the booking “on hold” for up to 21 days before they can make their payments. Before the launch of the product, customers would book their destinations and pay immediately. In addition, the product offers customers protection from ticket price increases and a way to avoid penalties in case of adjustments in their travel plans. In a statement on Tuesday, KQ said the airline has focused on creating a model that meets the needs of its dynamic market and customers, during a time where booking confidence has been knocked by the ever-changing nature of travel in the face of Covid-19. Chief Commercial and Customer Officer, Julius Thairu said they continue to develop and innovate their travel experience by placing passengers needs at the heart. "As this service goes live, we want our customers to feel more confident when booking with us and enjoy the option to pay when ready,” he said. This new service can be booked at any Kenya Airways Sales Office or preferred Travel Agent.
