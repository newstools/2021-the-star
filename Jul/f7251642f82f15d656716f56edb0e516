Police on Wednesday dispersed Saba Saba protesters, who took to the streets to march for a fair living. The human rights campaigners and youths were campaigning against youth unemployment and harsh economic times. The march is to mark the 31st Saba Saba, which is marked on July 7 every year. This is to commemorate the Second Liberation struggle in Kenya. Plain clothes police officers were seen arresting some of the youths taking part in annual Saba Saba protests at Archives area, Nairobi CBD on July 7, 2021. Dressed in red shirts and carrying red flags, the youths were also dispersed byÂ  police using teargas, as they carried on with their protests. The police also threw a teargas cannister which got stuck on a Star Bus wind screen as they dispersed the Saba Saba protestors. In Kenya, Saba Saba Day is remembered as the day in when nation-wide protests took place. On July 7, 1990, Kenyans took to the streets to demand free elections. The politicians who had called for the protests, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, were arrested days before the protest day. Other organisers of the day such as Njeru Gathangu, George Anyona, Raila Odinga etc were beaten up and detained by the then tyrannical dictator President Moi. In present day Kenya, Saba Saba has taken on a new meaning, with human rights defenders (HRDs) and civil society organisations asking for respect of the constitution, an end to police brutality and killings, advocating for a favourable legal and policy environment in Kenya. Some of the organisations are Inuka Kenya Ni Sisi, Kenya Human Rights Commission, National Coalition for Human Rights Defenders, the Social Justice Centres' Working Group and Mathare Social Justice Center among others.
