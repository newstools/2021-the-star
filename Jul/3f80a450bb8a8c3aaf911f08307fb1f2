The Kisumu government has embarked on an aggressive campaign to reclaim and conserve rivers in the county. Rivers targeted include Dunga, Kisat, Auji and Namthoi. City manager Abala Wanga said they are partnering with the Kisumu Water and Sanitation Company to identify and eliminate notorious polluters. “We want to transform the city and inculcate the culture of environmental conservation and greening the city,” the city manager said. He warned factories against discharging raw effluent into rivers and the lake. Wanga said Kiwasco has been asked to identify the polluting sources. “You realise that the smell that was from the lake has disappeared because of conservation. We are working on those pollution channels,” he said. The city manager announced that through the partnership, they will plant trees along the rivers. He said various institutions have been identified to plant three million trees. Tree seedling vendors in Kisumu have been incorporated to give professional advice for the survival of the trees planted. Wanga said they have identified organisations and incorporated them in a programme called ‘Greening the City’. He said they have rolled out a design to improve road corridors, starting  with the stretch between the airport and Kenya Breweries. In the initiative, they are partnering with Ciala Hotel. Wanga issued a stern warning to pedestrians and motorcyclists to respect the ongoing greening programme and protect the trees along Oginga Odinga Street. He said they will not tolerate destruction of trees and walkways. Edited by A.N
