Gor Mahia head coach Sammy Pamzo Omollo has blamed inexperience for their 2-1 loss to Kariobangi Sharks at Thika Stadium on Wednesday. The fortunes of the defending champions have experienced a steep decline in their recent encounters and Omollo has placed it all at the feet of a naive squad that lack ideas on the pitch. "A careful examination of the first goal we conceded will show you out-rightly we are bereft of experience to handle situations in our matches. For instance, John Ochieng only needed to delay the opponent who was not even facing our goal, but he let him off the hook and we got punished for that," said Omollo. His counterpart William Muluya extolled his charges for their renewed vigour which has seen them register a five-match unbeaten run. "I'm impressed with how the boys have been playing of late. I've always asked them to build up patiently from behind as they grope for goal scoring opportunities and the strategy has always proved effective against the opponents," said Muluya. Eric Kapaito stepped up and converted from the spot to put Kariobangi Sharks ahead in the 21st minute after he was sent tumbling down in the area. The striker effectively took his tally this season to 21, heightening his chances of bagging the golden boot. Then in the 71st minute, Robert Onyango latched onto Odede's pass and made no mistake as he sent the ball rolling past onrushing Gor custodian Gad Mathew. The loss has left Gor in fifth with 40 points, three behind arch-rivals AFC Leopards. KCB beat Ulinzi Stars 2-1 to close in on leaders Tusker. The outcome has propelled the bankers to 51 points, leaving them four adrift of theÂ  brewers, effectively driving the title duel to the wire.Sharks have risen to third where they sit pretty with 44 points. Vihiga United and Nairobi City Stars played out a barren draw, the same scoreline registered in the match between Posta Rangers and Nzoia.
