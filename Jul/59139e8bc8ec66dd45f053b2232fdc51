Deputy President William Ruto has said the political conversation is changing, with a focus on ordinary Kenyans and how they can be helped get jobs. Ruto made the remarks on Thursday in Karen, Nairobi, during a meeting with leaders from Lari constituency. He said the bottom-up approach to the economy will transform the country and uplift the majority of people, reducing poverty levels. The DP also lauded rivals for joining the bottom-up conversation. “We are encouraged by the new political conversation going on among political leaders. Our conviction is that we must focus our energy and resources on Kenya’s economic transformation,” Ruto said. The DP said the conversation will no longer be about political leaders sharing positions in the government. On Wednesday, Ruto lauded ODM leader Raila Odinga for 'joining' the hustler train after the latter talked about economic empowerment. “Today, even the Riddler himself (Raila) has accepted that Kenyans don’t want issues of changing the Constitution, but Kenyans want to talk about the economy.” “My friend Tinga, welcome to the Hustler movement. The conversation here is about the economy, not ethnicity, empowerment not power."  Edited by CM
