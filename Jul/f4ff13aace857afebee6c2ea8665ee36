South Nyanza-based Migori Youth twice came from behind to hold MCF 2-2 in a neck-and-neck Betika National Super League round of 26 match at Thika Stadium on Saturday. MCF drew the first blood when John Ochieng’s well-placed header landed in the back of the net following a brilliant 19th-minute corner kick. And in the 28th minute, James Kasibante almost made it two for MCF but his sitter missed the target by an inch. Hillary Ojwang then stumbled on a glorious chance to draw his side level in the 31st minute, but only ended up scooping his effort above the crossbar. Migori’s incessant raids finally came to fruition ten minutes later when Tyson Omondi headed in to level the terms. Hillary Ojwang’s frantically latched onto Mark Ochieng's enticing pass into the area on the stroke of halftime only to squander the moment. MCF had their agenda well defined for the second half and it wasn't long before Collins Onyango’s attempt from a setpiece rattled the crossbar in the 60th minute. They pushed on, and minutes later, Emmanuel Otieno sent his rasping close-range shot slamming the back of the net after coming on the end of an enticing delivery into the area. But Migori were not the sort to give up. Just nine minutes to stoppage time, Ben Stanley included his moniker in the score sheet to keep the scores at 2-2.
