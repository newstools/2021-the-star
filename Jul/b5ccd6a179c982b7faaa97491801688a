 A man accused of beating up his daughter and causing her death for spending nights away from home has denied a charge of manslaughter. Frankline Marangu appeared before Kibera chief magistrate Joyce Gandani on Thursday. Court papers say Marangu caused the death of Christine Ntwiga on May 21 at Jamhuri ASK Show Ground quarters. The girl was 15. In a police report, the management of Coptic Hospital said they received a patient, a student at a girls' school in Makueni, on May 20 at around 9pm. She wasÂ accompanied by her father. The report says that the father took the girl to the hospital for a check-up after she had run away from home and failed to report to school. Christine was examined and discharged and her father took her back to their Jamhuri home. The following day, the girl was rushed back after she collapsed at home following alleged beatings from her father. She was pronounced dead soon after. Police officers on duty went to the hospital over the incident and were shown the body of the girl lying at the emergency room. The officers said upon interrogations, Marangu admitted to beating the girl to discipline her for disappearing from school. The report says he told the police that the girl had been sneaking from home and spending nights away from her parents. He had once made a missing person's report at Jamhuri police station but his daughter resurfaced later. According to the report, the girl had been designated as a child in need of care and protection after Marangu sought help from the station's children and gender desk. The father had allegedly used a water pipe to beat up the girl. The suspect's lawyer pleaded for lenient bond terms. The magistrate released him on Sh300,000 bond or a cash bail of Sh100,000 with the same surety. The case will be mentioned on August 3.
