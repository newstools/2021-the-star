Twitter is testing a new feature where users will be able to upvote and downvote replies on tweets, saying this is still not a 'dislike' button. “Some of you on iOS may see different options to up or down vote on replies. We're testing this to understand the types of replies you find relevant in a convo," Twitter said on Thursday. "...so we can work on ways to show more of them." The testing is currently being done on a select group of iOS users. Twitter said users downvotes aren’t public, while their upvotes will be shown as likes. "Your downvotes are visible to you only. Votes won’t change the order of replies,” the micro-blogging website said. The thumb down icon is a downvote that lets you know that you think the reply isn’t relevant to the conversation. “We want to better understand the types of replies you do and don't find relevant in a convo,” it added. Upvoting a reply as part of this test will be treated as a like –– you’ll be notified and the reply will show up in their Likes tab. Downvotes are only limited to tweet responses, not the original tweet. As of now, only YouTube has a 'dislike button' that shows the number of likes and dislikes in a video. While YouTube’s dislike button is visible to all, Twitter does not want to show downvotes. Last week, Twitter announced the shutting down of the Fleets feature. Unlike tweets, Twitter’s new 'Fleets' could not receive Likes, Replies or Retweets. And they disappeared entirely after 24 hours. But Twitter said they had big hopes for Fleets, but now it’s time to say goodbye and take flight with other ideas.
