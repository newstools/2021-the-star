@robertomollo3 A former boyfriend of a Kenya Medical Training College student who was found murdered in her Homa Bay hostel has been arrested. Eli Odoyo, 37, was arrested on Tuesday morning for interrogation over the murder of Emily Chepkemoi which occurred last Friday. Emily was a clinical medicine student. Homa Bay town Directorate of Criminal Investigations officer Monica Berege said the suspect is likely to have crucial information over the murder. Berege said the suspect will be arraigned when investigations are concluded. On Tuesday, a postmortem revealed that the 23-year-old student died from suffocation and had been stabbed three times in the head and upper arm. The body was found in a pool of blood in her hostel bed in Oriang estate in Homa Bay town. Her brother Joseph Kipruto has called for justice. “We’re total orphans in our family. It’s very sad indeed and what we want is justice,” he said. Kipruto spoke as they ferried the body to Samaritan hospital mortuary in Kapsabet, Nandi county. KMTC students urged police to expedite investigations and give justice to their peer. On Tuesday, chairman of the student representative council David Odhiambo asked police to ensure the perpetrators do not escape. They argued that swift justice will prevent a repeat of such incident in the college. “DCI should investigate the matter and bring the culprit(s) to book. They should not suspend their inquest until the suspects are arrested,” Odhiambo said. Chepkemoi’s classmate Michele Akinyi said the murder is a serious loss to the entire college fraternity. “She was humble and inspirational to many of us, due to her hard work and dedication. We’ll miss my dear sister,” Akinyi said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
