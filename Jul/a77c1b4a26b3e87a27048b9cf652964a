Tanzanian singer Rayavanny has been in the spotlight after leaving his baby mama, Fahima, for Paula Kajala. The 'Wasi Wasi' hitmaker was called out by the baby mama for neglecting his family. When recently asked about these accusations, Vanny said he is happy. "People will know, if there comes a time I will post, then I'll post. I don't like to talk a lot about love and relationships, but I'm happy." He and his baby mama have a son together and served couple goals until they split last year. Early this year, Vanny was almost arrested for sharing a cosy video with Paula, who at the time was said to be underage. She has since finished Form 4 and is set to start her Form 5 studies.
