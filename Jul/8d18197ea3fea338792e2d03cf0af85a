President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday met leaders from Marasabit over security concerns in the County. In a statement by State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena, the head of state called on the leaders to use their positions of influence to foster peace and reconciliation. Uhuru added that the hallmark of true leadership is to give the present and future generations a peaceful, prosperous and united County. "With great regret, the Head of State observed that the violent conflicts leading to loss of lives, destruction of property, and displacement of persons are largely as a result of incitement by selfish politicians and community leaders," the statement said. Adding that, "The President challenged the leadership and the people Marsabit to honour heroic Kenyans who've lost their lives over the years in pursuit of peace in the region especially the seven leaders who painfully perished in the 2006 plane crash while on a peace mission to the County." The consultative meeting with a cross-section of leaders is part of ongoing sustained Government efforts to address security concerns in Marsabit County. The leaders present included elected officials from the national and county levels, serving state officials, clergy and other community officials. They all affirmed their individual and collective civic duty to promote peace in Marsabit County and the region. The meeting comes a few days after General Service Unit officers were deployed in parts of Marsabit to restore order amidst escalating community conflict. Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai said the deployment came after lives were lost, property destroyed, cattle rustling and rising tension in the area. GSU commandant Douglas Kanja is leading the operation. At the time of the GSU deployment, at least nine people had been killed.
