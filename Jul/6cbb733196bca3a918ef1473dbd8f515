The United Nations children's agency, Unicef, has condemned the kidnapping and murder of children in Nairobi and other parts of Kenya. It has called for those responsible to be held to account and for additional measures taken to protect children. A man aged 20 is in police custody after his alleged confession to killing more than 10 children. Masten Milimo Wanjala helped police recover at least two bodies of children he is said to have confessed to killing. The court has detained him for 30 days pending investigations that could lead to murder charges. Police said he showed no remorse and appeared to enjoy killing the children and detectives say he also drank the blood of some. There has been a sharp rise in child abduction cases in the last two months, prompting the government to form a special anti-kidnapping squad. Missing Child Kenya, an NGO that documents missing children, has listed 190 children as still missing. Parents have expressed concern over the safety of their school-going children. This week, a Kenyan court acquitted another self-confessed killer for insufficient evidence. Onyancha grabbed national headlines 10 years ago when he confessed to killing 17 women across the country and drinking their blood.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
