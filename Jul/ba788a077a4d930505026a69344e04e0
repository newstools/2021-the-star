The government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, has received a Sh3.8 billion grant from African Development Bank to improve irrigation in 11 counties. The counties are Makueni, Kajiado, Machakos, Bomet, Tharaka Nithi, Meru, Nyeri, Tana River, Murang’a, Nyandarua and Kitui. Agriculture CS Peter Munya said the counties will benefit from the construction of feeder roads to help farmers access markets under the Small-Scale Irrigation and Value Addition Programme. He spoke on Wednesday at Kilimo House during the flag-off and handing over of project vehicles for small-scale irrigation and value addition projects in various counties. The project is funded by the AfDB, in partnership with the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme and the Government of Kenya. “The ongoing SIVAP projects include 12 irrigation schemes; 38 water pans; 17 boreholes; eight shallow wells and sand dams; five grading shades; four livestock sale yards; and rehabilitation of 65km of rural roads, which are at various stages of completion,” Munya said. So far, the project has reached 106,900 households which are mainly pastoralists and agro-pastoralist. “The ministry through the project coordinating unit will set up demonstrations plots for crops, livestock fodder production and kitchen gardens as a Covid-19 response initiative,” he said. The aim is to address the need for food and nutrition security as well as income generation. Munya said the government has also set aside Sh500 million to support the one million kitchen garden initiative in 21 counties. This, he said, will be done through the provision of kitchen garden kits including solar dryers, shade nets, and assorted vegetable seeds for 213,090 households. “During the March-May 2020 rains, seeds and seedlings worth Sh7.8 million were purchased and distributed to the 11 counties. These counties have managed to set up 220 demonstrations plots for both crops and livestock fodder,” Munya said.  (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
