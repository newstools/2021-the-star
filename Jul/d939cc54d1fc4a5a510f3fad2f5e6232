Air Force Senior Sergeant Anthony Simon Kamuti, who perished in a chopper crash two week's ago, was laid to rest on Friday at his home in Mosa, Kitui South. He was one of 11 soldiers who were killed in the crash near Ngong in Kajiado county. He was praised as a dedicated, disciplined, dependable and accomplished radar technician whose death had robbed the nation of unmatched service. CO Major S.T. Chirchir said they had served side by side for six years, and he praised Kamuti as a brave soldier and a reliable engineer dedicated to the service. “We say in KDF that if one hurts, the entire force hurts and this accident caused us a great and painful loss,” Major P.M. Heya said. Kamuti's widow Margaret Mwende eulogised him as an amazing husband and father to their two sons and daughter. Former Kitui Governor Julius Malombe termed the accident tragic, saying it had robbed Kitui and the entire country of a gallant army man. The KAF helicopter which crashed and burst into flames at Ol Tepesi in Kajiado county on the morning of June 24, reportedly had 23 airmen on board. The survivors are recuperating at the Kenya Defence Forces Memorial Hospital in Mbagathi, Nairobi. The cause of the crash is being investigated.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
