Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday reacted to ODM leader Raila Odinga’s remarks on building an economy that works for all. The former Prime Minister had on Wednesday outlined his 14-point economic vision plan, to make Kenya the African continent’s headquarters for global business. In a tweet on Thursday, the DP said the political conversation has now changed and it's based on what the Hustler nation has been championing - A people-centred, jobs focused empowerment. "Leave the leaders-centred Constitution change to create positions, share power/meagre resources among the elite. Karibuni," Ruto said. Attached to his tweet was a video of Raila and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi talking about empowering Small and Medium Enterprises, as the best way to grow the economy. In Raila's macroeconomic vision that varies somewhat from Deputy President William Ruto's bottom-up approach, which focuses on the microeconomic aspect, the former PM said he imagines a country with a firm foundation for the rule of law backed by efficient government structures that can withstand pressure. The ODM leader went on to highlight some of the things that need to be done, for this to be achieved, including; investment in manpower development through a universal top-flight public education system and enforce meritocracy when hiring them. "End result; We make Kenya Africa’s leading financial centre; a logistics, shipping and aviation hub; Africa’s headquarter for global business, manufacturing and diplomacy. Jobs come, upward social mobility comes for all. I believe it’s possible," he said. Raila added that pursuing a low and transparent tax regime supported by a clean and efficient public service as well as investment in energy will help achieve this. DP Ruto has been calling out leaders who have been pushing for the Building Bridges Initiative  Constitutional change, terming them selfish individuals, who don't care about the wellbeing of Kenyans.
