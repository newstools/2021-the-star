The Kajiado county government is set to review downwards levies and fees charged to operate entertainment joints and restaurants. Governor Joseph Lenku told the Star on Sunday he had formed a seven-member special committee to review the levies imposed by the County Alcoholic Drinks Control Board. He said the team will be chaired by county public service and social services chief officer Jonathan Kulei. Kulei is expected to collaborate with officials from the finance department and the Bar and Restaurant Owners Association. Lenku said he formed the committee following a petition by traders who have suffered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. In a consultative meeting between Lenku and traders in Matasia town on Saturday, it was agreed that the sector has not benefitted from waivers being enjoyed by other businesses. Traders said it is punitive to continue paying the levies when trading hours had been reduced to only two hours daily. Bars in Kajiado operate from 5pm to 7pm. Operators said other businesses paying lesser levies are open from as early as 7am and close at 10pm. The operators said they had been forced to lay off many workers due to poor business. "I have heard your concerns, which are easy to understand. These are hard times and we shall partner and see how we can reduce the levies,‚Äù Lenku told them. He said the team should give him a report within seven days on what the county government can waive. Edited by A.N
