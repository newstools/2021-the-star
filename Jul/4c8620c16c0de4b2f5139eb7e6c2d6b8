Just when Zoo Kericho are still smarting from the utter shock of being flushed out of the Football Kenya Federation (FKF)Premier League in February over match-fixing allegations, the club has been dealt a further blow On Friday, their center-forward Collins Neto announced he was parting ways with the side, adding he was now a free agent and ready to join any club that would place a good offer. “I've decided to leave Zoo not because I have any issues with the club, but because I now feel it's time to explore new challenges. “They had expressed interest in extending my contract but I strongly feel I should move on. I thank Zoo for all they've done for me during my time at the club,” said Neto. He leaves the Kericho-based side with his head high, having netted a total of 13 goals spread across the two seasons he has been with the club. “I scored a total of 13 goals, 9 this season and four in the previous,” he said. The 27-year-old Nyamira Boys alumnus, who joined Zoo from Wazito in 2020, says he would one day wish to play football in Qatar like his childhood role model former Kenyan international Denis Oliech. Besides Oliech, Neto draws great inspiration from Portuguese icon Ronaldo. “I've always considered Denis my local role model while at the same time drawing a lot of inspiration from Ronaldo,” he said. Neto, who was once handed a senior call-up by coach Ken Odhiambo while still featuring for Western Stima, said his dream is to inspire the Kenyan national football team to a maiden World Cup appearance given a chance. “My dream is to play for Kenya in the World Cup,” said Neto. “I wish to encourage budding footballers to pursue their dreams given football is rewarding in the country,” he concluded. Neto kicked off his journey in the top tier with Muhoroni Youth and later joined Western Stima, Chemelil, and Wazito before ultimately landing a role with Zoo.
