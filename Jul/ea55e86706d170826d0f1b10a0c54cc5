Mathare United head gaffer Frank Ouna says they are not experiencing any pressure ahead of their crunch tie against leaders Tusker. The Slum Boys have a date with the Brewers at Ruaraka grounds on Tuesday and Ouna believes his charges can bounce back from the string of losses they have suffered in their recent matches to pull off a major surprise. “We are playing a team that is the best in the league and a win against them will give us the right boost towards wriggling our way to safety. If that isn’t motivation enough then you shouldn’t be with us,” said Ouna. Ouna reiterated they will be taking each game at a time as they step on the gas peddle to salvage themselves from the jaws of relegation. “We can’t play all eight matches at once. We play one at a time and for now I am only looking at our game against Tusker,” he said. The Slum Boys remain precariously placed at the bottom of the Football Kenya Federation premier League log with 14 points, having managed only three wins in the entire season. Ouna, who was roped in midway through the season in a frantic attempt to improve the side's dwindling fortunes, says they have borrowed some vital lessons from their previous outings and will use them to improve their status in the competition. “Every game is motivation enough for us because every game is an opportunity for us to get three points of which we desperately need.
