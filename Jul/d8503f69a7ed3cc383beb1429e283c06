National Super League side Talanta have their eyes firmly fixed on promotion to the Kenyan Premier League, team captain Jackton Onjala has said. Talanta came from behind to extend their advantage at the apex of the log following a 2-1 win over a revamped Mt. Kenya United side at GEMS Cambridge, Nairobi on Sunday. “The match was very tough but I'm glad we gave it our all and secured maximum points. Every game counts because we are determined to maintain the top spot and earn a promotion to the Premier League,” said Onjala. “It is tougher for us now because every team comes to the game prepared and keen to beat us and slow our campaign. But knowing what is at stake, we play each game as if it is a final.” Kevin Ndung’u put Mt. Kenya ahead in the ninth minute but Anthony Gicho levelled terms seven minutes later. Castro Ogendo then stabbed the back of the net in the 39th minute to condemn Mt. Kenya to their second straight loss. Following the win, the Ken Kenyatta-led Talanta now sit pretty at the summit of the table with 53 points, six clear of second-placed Kenya Police, who have a date with Coast Stima at Ruaraka on Monday afternoon. The two sides have been in a neck and neck race, swapping the two top positions at whim.
