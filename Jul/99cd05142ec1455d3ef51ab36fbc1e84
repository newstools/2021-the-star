Jua Kali artisans want the government to cut down on the importation of Personal Protective Equipment(PPE) to boost local production and expand informal sector jobs. The Kenya National Federation of Jua Kali Associations (KNFJKA) said this will support recovery of businesses in the informal sector through production of face-masks and other Covid-19 related protective gear. “Once the government stops importing masks, Jua kali artisans are going to make money especially in the informal sector because most tailors in the market are going to sell a lot of re-usable masks and aprons,” said KNFJKA Nairobi Center Manager, Teresia Njora. Njora said beneficiaries of the Kenya Ni Sisi Campaign will find it economical to start producing more PPE under the initiative and on their own for trade in the bigger informal sector market. The Kenya Ni Sisi Campaign aims to distribute 1,500,000 PPE and create at least 15 million jobs by allowing the informal sector to play an integral role in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The initiative will also deploy 6,000 (3,000 ltr) contactless water stations nationwide that have a sustainable water solution and build 100,000 SATO sanitary toilets, in the war against the pandemic. Genesis Group, Group Executive Director Valentine Gichau has called on more organisations, companies and individuals to support the initiative to help redeem business of its affected members. “We continue calling on Kenyans from all walks of life to join the initiative and make a lasting impact by touching a life” said Gichau. Kenya’s informal sector was hit hard by Covid-19 pandemic with most of its workforce rendered jobless. Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data estimates that around two million people lost their jobs due to the outbreak.
