Varsity students across the country have protested against the move by the University of Nairobi to double tuition fees for post-graduate and self-sponsored degree courses. “We don’t recognise any fee increment in our institutions, be it gradual or anything else. We usually expect UoN to set precedent for other universities to follow, but this time we are disappointed,” Kenya University Students Organisation chairman Anthony Manyara said. The students are mulling moving to court to stop the decision by UoN to double tuition fees. They say education is a basic need and should be given free of charge, or at an affordable rate. Lower Eastern Kenya university colleges students association (LEKUCSA) has asked the Ministry of Education and the Office of the President to intervene. “It is heartbreaking to wake up to an unconstitutional act of fee increment in our universities,” a statement signed by LEKUCSA chairperson Johnson Mboya stated. Dedan Kimathi University management also increased their tuition fees in June this year. In 2019, the government sponsored students paid Sh39,215 but this year first years were asked to pay Sh70,000. Second year students are paying up to Sh63,755, an increment from Sh35,000. Students from the university plan to stage a demonstration on July 15. As students protest the fee increment, varsity unions such as Universities' Academic Staff Union (UASU) have defended the decision, saying the increment will improve management and academic standards.
