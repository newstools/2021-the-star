The misuse of social media could result in chaos during the 2022 General Election, Kenya Film and Classification Board CEO Ezekiel Mutua has said. Mutua said fake news circulated on social media platforms, if not well monitored, will instigate violence. He spoke in Mombasa on Wednesday. Mutua said the digital space is becoming a threat as Kenya approaches the electioneering period. He urged the mainstream media to give a blackout to politicians who incite Kenyans against one another. Mutua said that the ICT ministry is already in talks with Google to ensure that any content that will be considered inflammatory and inciteful will be flagged and pulled down. Kenya Broadcasting Corporation director Charles Mulila said the country boasts of the most vibrant media in the region. “Dissemination of news and information should be structured in such a way that both the players' and consumers rights are adequately protected,” Mulila said. KFCB and KBC managers were in Mombasa to establish a one-stop-shop for the youth to grow in innovation and creativity. Mombasa county commissioner Gilbert Kitiyo said that the initiative will follow the Huduma centres model. “We have so many youths who have a lot of talent but they lack resources, we appreciate this partnership and assure our support in the programme,”  Kitiyo said.
