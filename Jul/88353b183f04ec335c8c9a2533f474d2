Mansukh Patel, 77, the prominent philanthropic industrialist and owner of Solai estate, was cremated on Thursday. The private ceremony was conducted under strict Covid-19 protocols and devoid of speeches. Apart from close family members, only a few friends and leaders including Tourism Cabinet Secretary, Najib Balala, Nakuru Governor, Lee Kinyanjui and Baringo Senator, Gideon Moi were invited. Police officers were deployed to man the main gate at his Milmet Farm to keep off hundreds of residents who wanted to witness the final send off. Patel died on Monday evening while undergoing treatment at Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi following a short illness. His remains were cremated at the family’s vast Solai Coffee Estate farm in Subukia Sub-County of Nakuru County. Mansukh was eulogised as an industrialist and a philanthropist who was always willing to share his knowledge and wealth. His family came into the spotlight after its Solai dam burst and killed 48 people. For decades, Mansukh and his family had lived in harmony with the community. There are three schools named after the Patel family with many others having being given separate names by the locals. Mourning his death on Tuesday, Governor Kinyanjui described Patel as a great farmer and industrialist who invested a lot in social responsibility. “I am deeply saddened by the death of a man who touched his community in a great way,” said Kinyanjui. The governor eulogised Patel as a man who was always eager to share his knowledge and wealth. Despite the dam tragedy, the community described him as a sociable and  philanthropic man.
