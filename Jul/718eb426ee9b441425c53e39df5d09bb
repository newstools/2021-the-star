AFC Leopards bounced back from their Sunday's Betway Cup finals defeat to Gor Mahia with an emphatic 2-0 win over coastal lads, Bandari, at Thika Municipal Stadium on Friday. Second-half goals by Robert Mudenyu and Peter Thiong’o were enough to bag the 13-time Kenyan champions all the three points and keep them in contention for their first title since 1998. Bandari started out as the better side as both Atariza Amai and William Wadri exposed Leopards' third choice custodian Ezekiel Owade to acid tests early in action. However, Leopards came back for the second half more organized and it wasn't long before Robert Mudenyu got on the end of a cross from a corner kick to slam the ball past Justin Ndikumana. With only 10 minutes left on the clock, second half substitute, Peter Thiong’o, rose unmarked to stretch Leopards' lead. Following the win, Leopards, have maintained their third spot on the log with 43 points, a three behind KCB who play leaders Tusker on Sunday.
