After successful resuming Left Foot Sports league action in Nairobi, the organisers have confirmed they will now head to Mombasa to plan for the resumption of the edition. The Left Foot sponsored leagues for Nairobi finally resumed two weeks ago after they had taken a break owing to the first outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in the country in March 2020. And with Nairobi action back, Left Foot Sports Director Aman Bhasin has confirmed they are now heading to Mombasa to talk the clubs over a possible resumption by August. “The league is gaining traction and if LFS team will travel to Mombasa over the weekend of July 24 to meet corporate and social teams to discuss the commencement of the Mombasa leg in August 2021,” Bhasin explained. In Nairobi, action continued with One Africa Logistics coming from a goal down to snatch a 1-1 draw against Nyayo FC. It was Nyayo who took a deserved lead in the 23rd minute when Frank Nyaga headed home from a corner kick but One Africa Logistics waited until the 67th minute to level matters when Aahad Pamani scored from close range. In other matches, Manarat FC cruised to a 3-0 win against Tazz Advisors, Strath FC snatched a 1-0 win against Senti Milan, while Samaj Thunderbolts suffered a humiliating 7-0 defeat in the hands of Saad Advocates. In the Corporate League, only two matches were played, Apec Consortium hammering SportPesa 5-1 while NCBA drew 1-1 with Nation Media.
