The Government is not considering reviewing the directive on full capacity for rail and air transport during this Covid-19 pandemic, Health PS Susan Mochache has said. The PS while appearing before the National Assembly Health Committee on Thursday said the rail and air transporters will continue carrying passengers at full capacity despite the health protocols requiring that 1.5 meters distance is maintained between passengers. Mochache told MPs that, unlike road transport, rail and air transport is well controlled and coordinated to ensure safety. “Raila and air conveyances have controlled air suction that continuously filters fresh air into the cabins, unlike public road transport vehicles,” she said. “Further, there are strict procedures that guide the booking, ticketing, on-boarding and sitting arrangements in these two modes of transport.” She also noted that thorough screening of the passengers especially temperature screening and hand sanitizing at several points before boarding eliminates the entry of suspected cases into the cabin and helps in keeping passengers safe. The PS was appearing before the session chaired by Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny to respond to questions raised by Starehe lawmaker Charles Njagua. Njagua had sought answers as to why the government was allowing rail and air transport to carry passengers at full capacity during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic while subjecting other means of public transport to reduced passenger capacity requirements.
