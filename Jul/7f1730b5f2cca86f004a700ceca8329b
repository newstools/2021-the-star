One Kenya Alliance principals have implored President Uhuru Kenyatta to lift the restrictions imposed to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic by the end of the month. Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Gideon Moi (Kanu), and Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) said that coronavirus is the new norm that Kenyans should learn to live with. “Appreciating this new norm, we urge the government to lift the countrywide restrictions by the end of the month and re-introduce the earlier economic safeguards including a review of the tax regime to stimulate the economy,” they said. The government introduced several measures to contain the spread of the contagion. They include the countrywide dusk to dawn curfew, the ban on gatherings, and restricted numbers at funerals and weddings. The leaders addressed journalists after attending a four-hour closed-door meeting at a hotel in Karen, Nairobi where they discussed modalities of actualizing the alliance. They asked the government to intensify the vaccination program to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the population is vaccinated by the end of the year. “As One Kenya Alliance, economic recovery remains our priority. To this end, we note that corruption still remains the biggest challenge stifling this revival,” they said in a statement read out by Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr. As such, they called upon the government to intensify the fight on graft to rid the country of the menace.
