Principals of the One Kenya Alliance should embrace Raila Odinga if he is willing. The underlying issue we have been hearing from OKA principals is the issue of trust. That is the one thing they keep repeating. They are saying that there has been a trust deficit and because of that, the coalition is no longer tenable. Now they are sayingÂ  Nasa is part of the past and they are talking about the future. Raila is a respectable leader. He has the following, and if indeed they are able to agree on those issues of trust, then it would be good to have him. The aim of OKA is to include everybody who is of a similar mind and that is why they are expanding their boundaries. It is not just about the former Nasa parties. Many of us in Jubilee are interested and others from other parties are interested too. The agenda of OKA looks like a solid one. In politics, no bridges should be burnt. In politics you never say never. Politics is the art of the possible not the burden of the absolute. If Tinga joins, it means that is new relationship, a new agenda under new terms but not constrained in the box of what Nasa was. For many of us had not joined NASA as it was, but we have seen leaders who we can work with so t we can create something big that looks forward to the future. There are many of us in Jubilee who think the party should be part of OKA. There are quite a number of us. But the party must now use its structures and consult its membership. The mistake that has been made in the past is that people are talking about a Jubilee and ODM merger but they have not consulted the organs. Some of us are there, we are founding members but we just hear from the press about the merger. The process of a merger needs membership to be brought on board. But Jubilee, if we are able to look at it critically as members, then we feel it should be part of the future. And the future is OKA. The Nairobi senator spoke to the Star on the phone Edited by V.
