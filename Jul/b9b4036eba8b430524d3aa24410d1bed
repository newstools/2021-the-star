Musician Reuben Kigame's plan to make public his presidential bid was cut short by police officers on Wednesday morning. Kigame had called a press conference at Chester House but journalists were turned back at the entrance. The gospel artiste took to social media to air his disappointment, vowing to find a way to make it happen today. "The physical gathering for my presidential bid launch has been cancelled. The police have informed us that there should be no physical gatherings today," Reuben Kigame wrote. "What a mockery of freedom launched on this day 31 years ago! Stay put for the next communication. It will still happen today." The 'Enda Nasi' singer made public his intentions to contest for the top seat in April, saying the tough times the country is undergoing have prompted him to make the tough decision.
