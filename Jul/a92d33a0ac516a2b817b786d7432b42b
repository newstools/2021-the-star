President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda has put on notice those misusing social platforms in Uganda. Museveni spoke on Thursday when he met local and foreign investors. He said the security apparatus needs to crack down on people misusing social media, including Ugandans abroad. The president said that some people have been spreading rumours that he had died. “Social media apparently has been saying that Museveni is dead…locate quickly the ones who tell such stories because you are wasting people’s time,” Museveni said. He added, “Many are now using it to spread baseless and tasteless news with total abandon. I call upon security to look into this. It must be stopped, get these people.” Museveni has also asked Africans to wake up, lest they find themselves building a Latin America in Africa instead of the United States of Africa. “If you do not wake up and catch up with history, you may end up building a Latin America in Africa instead of building the United States of Africa in Africa.”
