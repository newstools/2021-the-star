Cyclist Cameron Meyer said on Monday he has withdrawn from Australia’s Olympic team for this month’s Tokyo Games because his father is battling brain cancer. The 33-year-old won gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in the road time trial and was set to become a two-time Olympian, having finished fourth in the points race at the 2008 Beijing Games. “Due to family health reasons where my father is continuing to battle stage four brain cancer and with the difficult travel restrictions around the Covid pandemic, I believe I am unable to represent my country in Tokyo at 100%,” Meyer said in a statement. “The Olympics are a special privilege for any athlete, and I would not feel right knowing my condition was not where it needed to be due to my current circumstances. “I look forward to spending some quality time with my family during this difficult period and will be cheering on what I’m sure will be a successful Australian Olympic team.” Cycling Australia performance director Simon Jones said the selection panel will meet this week to name Meyer’s replacement. The Tokyo Games, delayed last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, will begin on July 23.
