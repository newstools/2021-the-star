Pan-African developer BTE Renewables and Kenyan-owned renewable developer Craftskills have announced full completion of  Kipeto wind farm,connected to the national grid in January. All the project’s 60 wind turbines are now producing power making Kipeto Kenya’s second largest wind power project, providing power to the equivalent of approximately 250,000 households. Kipeto is BTE Renewables’ fifth project to reach commercial operations in the last year, now having 384 MW in operations in Kenya and South Africa. Kipeto enters into commercial operation after 12 years. "We are now providing clean and sustainable energy for the people of Kenya with the support of KPLC and Ketraco," said  Kenneth Namunje, Chairman and Director of Kipeto Energy Plc and Director of Craftskills. Located in Kajiado, the Kipeto project reached financial close in December 2018. Commercial operation is pegged on a 20 year Power Purchase Agreement with Kenya Power. The project is funded by equity from Actis-backed BTE Renewables (88 per cent ) and Craftskills Limited (12 per cent), alongside senior debt from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the US  government’s development finance institution, and African Trade Insurance Agency (ATI) are  providing an on-demand insurance product for the project. Kipeto has further partnered with USAID Power Africa in developing its Biodiversity Action Plan. Worley, China Machinery and Engineering Company and GE are construction partners. The project is second in capacity after the Lake Turkana Wind Power project which is also  Africa's largest wind energy project with a production capacity of 300MW of low-cost renewable energy.
