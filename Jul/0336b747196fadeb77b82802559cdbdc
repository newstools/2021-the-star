One Kenya Alliance leaders on Wednesday held daylong deliberations on how to strengthen their unity ahead of 2022. In a statement, Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka said the meeting was also attended by elected leaders from the OKA parties who discussed ways that they can strengthen the coalition. "Concluded a daylong meeting with my colleagues in the One Kenya Alliance, Hon. Musalia Mudavadi, Sen. Gideon Moi Â and Sen. Moses Wetangula," Kalonzo said. Gideon Moi was meeting the alliance partners for the first time after reports said that he had ditched them for ODM leader Raila Odinga and his party was crafting a 2022 coalition partnership with the Orange party. Kanu secretary general Nick Salat later denied the reports of Kanu leaving OKA, stating that they were misleading. The Kanu Chairman affirmed that OKA will continue forging solid partnerships with leaders who share their vision of a united and prosperous nation. "A nation where our people have equal opportunity to thrive in their economic and social endeavours," Moi said. Elected leaders present at the meeting included; Senators Johnson Sakaja, Enoch Wambua and Mutula Kilonzo Junior, and MP William Kamket among others. The elected leaders were drawn from ANC, Wiper, Kanu and Ford Kenya parties. In an interview with News Central, ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi said OKA is still an ongoing conversation that has been in existence for barely two months and they are still looking at a few things before it can become an official coalition. He noted that there is going to be more political alliances in the days to come. "There are technical teams behind the other parties going through some very technical issues that can then be subjected to further political consensus before we can consummate a formal coalition," Mudavadi said.
