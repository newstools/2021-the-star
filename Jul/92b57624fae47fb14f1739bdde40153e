LSK President Nelson Havi was on Tuesday freed on a Sh10,000 cash bail and is expected to take a plea on Wednesday. Havi had earlier been arrested at his office in Nairobi after being accused of injuring society CEO Mercy Wambua. He was taken to DCI headquarters for questioning. The LSK President allegedly injured Wambua at their Gatanga Road-based offices during a meeting on Monday. Police said they had asked Havi to present himself for questioning over the claims but did not honor the same. Havi dismissed the claims saying Wambua forced her way into the boardroom while they were having a meeting with the intention of recording the proceedings. Wambua who was accompanied by her lawyer Steve Ogolla, recorded a statement at the Muthangari Police Station claiming Havi allegedly accosted her in the boardroom where she was to have a meeting. A police report at Muthangari station under OB number is 34/12/7/2021 shows Wambua reported her right arm and finger were hurt during a scuffle that erupted during the heated meeting. Speaking to the Star, Wambua said she and the council had a meeting convened both physically and virtually. Upon learning that Havi and team had converged at the board room, she said she joined them but was met by shouts that she was a stranger, and had to leave. "He was there with legitimate council members allied to him as well as a team calling themselves caretaker members. Other legitimate council members joined online," she said. She added when she sat down, opened her laptop and refused to leave, she claimed, the president rose up and charged at her, slamming her laptop shut and shoving her.
