Kenya Police squandered a glorious opportunity to close in on leaders Talanta following their shock 2-1 loss to Coast Stima in their hotly contested National Super League round 29 encounter at Ruaraka grounds on Monday. Stima shook off their underdog tag heading into the tie to pull off the biggest upset of the season. Lucky Kaingu's splendid effort fired the coastal lads ahead in the 18th minute, the lone goal separating the sides as they headed for the break. Stima then emerged from the tunnel more rejuvenated for the second half and it wasn't long before they found a reason to celebrate once again. Keith Imbali found the back of the net in the 72nd minute to double the advantage. Police looked destined to lose by a bigger margin but Arvin Odoyo came to the law enforcers' rescue with a goal in the 82nd minute to reduce the deficit. The loss leaves Police rooted at third with 44 points. Talanta complicated the promotion arithmetic for the law enforcers with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Mt. Kenya at GEMS Cambridge on Sunday. The outcomeÂ  fired the coach Ken Kenyatta-led charges to 53 points, and left them 9 points clear of second-placed Fortune Sacco. On the other hand, Coast Stima now have 28 points although they still remain battling relegation in the 19th, one spot above bottom-placed Soy United. Vihiga Bullets and Nairobi Stima square it out at ASK grounds in Nakuru this afternoon as Gusii and Shabana face off at Narok Stadium. Second-placed Fortune Sacco have a chance to close gap on Talanta when they flex muscles with Silibwet at Narok Stadium in a rescheduled match on Wednesday.
