A Nairobi Court on Thursday acquitted Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria of assault charges against a female TV commentator. Milimani Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku acquitted the legislator after the complainant Joyce Wanja withdrew the case against him. While withdrawing the case, Wanja informed the court that she wished to withdraw saying that she had forgiven him. Wanja, who is a commentator at Inooro TV, denied being paid or coerced to have the case withdrawn. "I have not been forced or coerced in any way by the accused to have me withdraw the matter", she told the court. Kuria had been accused of assaulting Wanja at the Royal Media Services premises in December 2019. He had been released on Sh20, 000 cash bail.
