Police in Mwingi have raised concern over rising cases of mob justice in the town. With rising cases of insecurity, Mwingi residents have been taking law into their hands and lynching suspected criminals. In the past week, three suspects of robbery within the town have been beaten by a mob and burnt alive in separate attacks. The recent incident occurred on Saturday morning where a man was assaulted and burned to death by an angry mob after he was reportedly caught breaking into a house. Residents claimed the rental houses had had a break in incident a day before the man was caught inside one of the houses.  Residents then beat him before  they burnt him. They claimed the killed suspect had been a notorious thief who alongside his gang has been terrorising businessmen in Mwingi town and breaking into their premises at night. Maliti Mengi, a businessman in the town, asked police take action and arrest the situation before it gets out of hand. “There are so many theft cases at night yet police officers are said to be doing their patrols at night,” he said. Ndanu Kimanzi, another resident asked police officers to work hand in hand with residents to ensure insecurity in the area has been tamed, adding that they are tired of insecurity. Mwingi central subcounty police commander Peter Mutuma said he was concerned that so many cases of mob justice were reported within a short period. He appealed to the residents not to take the law into their hands but rather report the crime to the police or provide information through the relevant community structures. -Edited by SKanyara
