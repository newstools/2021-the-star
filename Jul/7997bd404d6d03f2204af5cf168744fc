Avocado has been making the round for the last few years and had become a global phenomenon. However, in addition to being generally delicious, they are also packed full of health benefits for you and your child. These include a higher content of potassium than bananas, heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and fibre. Parents are always striving to ensure their children are getting balanced meals, so we have the perfect quick snack that is guaranteed to please your child and we partnered with Suntop to help you out.
