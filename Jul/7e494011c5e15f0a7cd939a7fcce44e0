The county assembly of Vihiga has approved a motion seeking to remove Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi from office. The notice of motion that was tabled by Wodanga MCA Vincent Atsiaya was signed by 37 MCAs. Shiru ward MCA Nixon Butiya did not sign the motion. The notice of motion cited that Saisi violated the Constitution, engaged in abuse of office and gross misconduct. The notice was issued by the speaker after she received the motion accompanied with 37 out of 38 signatures, which surpassed the constitutionally required threshold of 15 votes (Standing order 66. 1) Initially the leader of Minority Tom Atingo said the deputy governor might face impeachment for sabotaging the government. This comes after the assembly impeached four CECMs over gross misconduct and misuse of office. Initially, Saisi was accused for engineering the governor's impeachment, and coluding withÂ  CECMs to derail county projects. Previously, Saisi had dismissed the claims, saying Governor Wilberforce Ottichilo created his own downfall. The two have had a strained relationship since their election in 2017. Saisi had accused the governor of not facilitating his office and paralysing operations. However, Ottichilo accused his DG of being petty, adding that fueling vehicles and furnishing county offices are not under him.
