Political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi has recorded a statement with the police over the inferno that occurred at his Runda home on Wednesday. Nairobi regional commander Augustine Nthumbi said Ngunyi went to the nearest police station to record the statement. "Police are investigating the cause of an inferno to know who started the fire, why and how it happened. It's the investigations that will help," he told the Star. Nthumbi said there were three people in the house. "Mutahi, his wife and their housekeeper were in the house when the fire broke out but they all escaped unhurt," he said. Mutahi's home was set ablaze by unknown persons in Runda. The huge house went up in flames as black smoke billowed from the residence at around 1.45 am. Sounds of furniture burning could be heard as some people tried to put off the fire. Firefighters from Kiambu and Nairobi counties managed to put out the fire at around 4 am. Via a tweet on Wednesday, Mutahi said the fire happened immediately after he talked about the Kiambaa violence that took place in 2008 during his online Fifth Estate segment. Seventeen people, mostly women and children, were burnt alive inside the Kiambaa church, and more than eighteen other people were shot with arrows, hacked with machetes, and killed. Mutahi went ahead to post the picture of the burning mansion in which he tagged digital strategist Dennis Itumbi. Earlier before the analyst could post about the burning house, Itumbi had tweeted about the same. "Dear Fire Brigade, please rush and save @MutahiNgunyi Runda House from FIRE. @NMS_Kenya quick action for a guy who supports you if nothing else," he said.
