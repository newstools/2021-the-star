A second-half double from former Brazil striker Hulk gave Atletico Mineiro a 2-1 win away at Corinthians on Saturday and lifted them into joint top spot in the Serie ‘A’. Gustavo Mosquito put Corinthians ahead with a well-taken goal seven minutes before halftime but a brace from Hulk in 63 and 87 minutes — the first a superb free-kick — gave the visitors all three points. The victory extended Atletico’s winning run to five games and lifted them level on points with Palmeiras, who play Atletico-GO on Sunday. The result means Corinthians remain in 12th place in the 20-team league with 14 points from 12 games. Meanwhile, Gremio scored in the 89th minute to beat Fluminense 1-0 and record their first win of Brazil’s Serie A season on Saturday at the Maracana stadium. Cesar Pinares’ penalty gave the Porto Alegre side their first win in 10 league matches and lifted them off the bottom of the Serie A into 18th place in the 20-team league. The three points took them on to six points from 10 games and gave a much-needed filip to the team playing for their third match under Luiz Felipe Scolari, the coach who returned to Gremio for a fourth spell earlier this month. Fluminense fell to eighth, with 17 points from 12 matches.
