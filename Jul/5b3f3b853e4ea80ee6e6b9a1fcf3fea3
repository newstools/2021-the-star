A Sh1.4 billion water project in Mandera that is aimed at benefitting 250,000 residents will be completed by November. The project will improve water production and increasing the supply to residents in Mandera town and its environs. It will also improve access, quality, availability, and sustainability of water supply services in Mandera and the surrounding areas to catalyse economic growth and build resilience against climate change. According to Suhufi Agency, the company contracted to oversee the works, the project will increase water supply from a low of 2,000 m³ per day, against a demand of 7,650 m³ to 16,000m³ per day, which is the projected  water demand by 2030. The company agent Joseph Mololo said the project has a capacity to treat more than 16,000 cubic metres per day. Its storage capacity is 16,037 cubic metres with concrete underground tanks and elevated steel-pressed tanks to cover the entire Mandera town and its environs including Koromey. While explaining to members of the county development implementation and coordination committee during an inspection tour, Mololo said that upon completion, a 317,000-metre pipeline will have been laid. County commissioner Onesmus Kyatha said the government was keen on the project because it will be a major game changer for women and children, who have to walk long distances in search of water. “The government has always supported you in matters of security to ensure your work is not affected. It’s your turn to make sure this project is completed on time and end the perennial water shortage in this region,” he said. Kyatha and his team promised to visit and monitor the project's progress every two weeks. Meanwhile, as part of its social corporate responsibility Suhufi agency has constructed two blocks of five classrooms each at Shafshaffey Primary School and two 2-bedroomed staff houses at Burgallas Primary School.
