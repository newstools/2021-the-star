An oxygen plant bought from France in May at Sh30 million by Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has stalled. The plant was acquired to help the county to cut expenses of buying oxygen from other counties and to lower the ICU costs for the residents. Ottichilo bought the facility after the country was hit by oxygen shortage in amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Acting health executive Inonda Mwanje said the county is struggling to get oxygen from neighbouring counties after the plant stalled. Innonda was appointed in acting capacity after Amos Kutwa was impeached by the assembly and dismissed by Ottichilo. He said the county has insufficient cylinders to ferry oxygen from the neighboring counties. "Our referral hospital requires seven cylinders on a daily basis but at the moment we have only  three," he said. “Our oxygen plant had a mechanical breakdown that was a result of power. We are currently in talks with KPLC management in Mbale town to set up a mini-transformer to avoid such disasters in the future,” Mwanje said. He spoke at Jumuia Hospital in Hamisi subcounty where he received Equity Bank CEO James Mwangi. Mwangi had toured the mission hospital to donate PPE in support of the war against Covid-19 pandemic. Mwangi said war against covid-19 pandemic is a collective responsibility for all people and not only the government or health sector. Edited by Henry Makori
