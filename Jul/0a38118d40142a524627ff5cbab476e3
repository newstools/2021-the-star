The swearing-in of Anne Kananu as Nairobi Governor has been temporarily halted pending an appeal filed by activist Okiya Omtatah. Court of Appeal Judges Wanjiru Karanja (presiding), Jessie Lessit and Justice Jamila Mohammed said the order will remain in force until October 22, when further directions will be issued. In April, Kananu declared she will contest for Nairobi governor next year. When she took over from county assembly speaker Benson Mutura, who was acting governor, Kananu said her focus was to bring in new leadership in the county. "I am not a politician, and I will not start being one. I’m focused on bringing a new spirit of cooperation, collaboration, partnership and mutual respect with all organs of government. Nairobi is now back on course," she said. However, after declaring her interest in the governor's seat, she warned potential opponents to brace themselves for a tough political duel in the capital city. "I will be vying in 2022. For those who think I am only here for a little while, I am telling them that I am here to stay. We shall face-off,” Kananu said. Prior to January 15, 2021, Kananu had served as the Disaster Management chief officer for three years, where she maintained a low profile. Her former boss and Governor Mike Sonko nominated her as his deputy on January 6 last year, but the court blocked the county assembly from vetting her. After the court cleared the case, Kananu was vetted and sworn in as Nairobi’s deputy governor which hindered the chances of a by-election being held after Sonko was impeached.
