Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi is expected to appear before the County Assembly in seven days upon receiving an invitation notice. Speaker Hasna Mudeizi on Thursday said the House will invite him to respond to accusations tabled against him. In a motion seeking to impeach him, Siasi has been accused of abuse of office and misuse of power. The motion tabled by Wodanga MCA Vincent Atsiaya states that Executive is accountable to the governor while discharging activities, but Saisi has failed to comply. Atsiaya said Siasi has failed to maintain a harmonious working relationship with Governor Wilberforce Ottichilo. “Madam Speaker, the DG has undermined the Governor and the CECMs as well,” he said. “The DG has further violated the Public Finance Act 2012, where he initially misused public coffers in the name of sensitizing meetings with the community,” he said. Atsiaya further said Sh845,000 was used for public sensitisation which never took place. Saisi was further accused for failing to appear before the county assembly to give information on matters it was investigating. The DG is further accused of violating the public procurement and disposal and public finance management acts.
