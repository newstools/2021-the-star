A former official has been fined Sh3.3 million for misappropriating Sh870,000 at the Youth Enterprise Development Fund. Eric Otieno Oyare was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment in the event he fails to raise the fine for the irregularity involving cash set aside for five constituencies in Eastern region. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission said in a brief on the case that the sentences will run consecutively beginning June 28, 2020, being the date the official was convicted. EACC said it established that the money was misappropriated in December 2011 and fraudulently accounted for by officers of the fund. The fines heaped on the Senior Research and Policy Officer arose from the  offences for which he was eventually convicted and sentenced. Oyare was fined Sh50,000 or serve one year in jail for fraudulent acquisition of public property or serve a year in jail. “In addition, he will pay a further fine of Sh234,000 for the benefit he acquired from the offence,” the EACC brief reads.
