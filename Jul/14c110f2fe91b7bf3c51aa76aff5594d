The seven-judge bench hearing the BBI appeal has said it will take 50 days to make a ruling. Court of Appeal President Daniel Musinga said they will deliver the judgment seven weeks from today on August 20. The August 2022 General Election is fast approaching and election experts have warned that the plebiscite is no longer tenable. Prof Githu Muigai on Friday pleaded with the court to give an early date because of theÂ  IEBC timelines they have. However, Justice Musinga said they will not change the date. Justice Musinga will retreat with his colleagues Justices Hannah Okwengu, Patrick Kiage, Fatuma Sichale, Gatembu Kairu, Roselyne Nambuye and Francis Tuyyoit. Justice Musinga thanked all the parties who have been in court battling out since Tuesday this week seeking to persuade the court to rule in their favour. The case has over 20 active parties who have each filed submissions and list of authorities that the judges have to go through.
