Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi has said that Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i needs to go and talk to residents in the region before he can think of becoming a presidential candidate in 2022. While reacting to reports that Matiang’i was being groomed to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta, Maangi said the CS has no support from Kisii region. "In Kenyan politics for you to stand a chance at the national level you need to have a bloc of votes. I doubt if Matiang’i controls Kisii and Nyamira," Maangi said on TV47, on Monday. He accused the CS of being at loggerheads with several regional leaders, adding he doubted he would receive support from them. DG Maangi’s reaction came after the Star established that former Prime Minister Raila Odinga could be grooming the super CS for the top job. Sources privy to details of the plan say Matiang’i and Raila are working on an elaborate plan that will start by uniting Nyanza to vote as a bloc. A meeting of all political leaders from Nyanza is expected in the next few days where the Matiang'i development will be discussed. There is talk the meeting will seek to harness the unity of Nyanza, including on fielding candidates to avert discord in the region. A senior state official who asked not to be named told the Star the grand plan is to groom the CS for a face-off with DP Ruto in the 2022 duel. He is being viewed as the best candidate for President Kenyatta and Raila’s handshake side," the official said.
