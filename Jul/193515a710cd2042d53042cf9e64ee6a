Before the surprise win against AFC Leopards in mid-week, Kariobangi Sharks were on a shocking run of four consecutive losses. That abject run coincided with the absence of defensive rock, Geoffrey Lemu Shiveka who has been injured. Now on the mend, the one-club man is eager to return to the pitch in time for the season run-in. “The knee injury came at a bad moment for me because I was feeling good in terms of my performances and the team was stabilising in as far as the results were concerned. It was an unfortunate moment when I twisted the knee but nothing was torn and according to our physiotherapist, it will take just a month more for me to return to full team training,” said Shiveka. Shiveka is confident the victory against Leopards courtesy of a lone second-half penalty from star striker Eric Kapaito can be the beginning of a strong run for William Muluya’s charges. “The win was a timely one. Even more important because it was against a team that is above us in the league table and is challenging for the title. Now the confidence of the team will be sky high and if we remain level headed we can finish the season strongly,” he said. The 25-year-old no nonsense centre-back also refused to surrender his club's title ambitions despite them being a massive 13 points behind league leaders and Caf Champions League bound Tusker. “The season is still very long with twelve matches still to play. We have seen teams drop unlikely points and if we can string  together a run of victories, we will have our say in the title race,” Shiveka maintained.
