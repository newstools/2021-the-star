Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has termed Otile Brown Kenya's most talented artiste. Otile had paid a courtesy call to the governor, who through his social media said that he had a wonderful time interacting with one of Kenyaâ€™s successful artistes. "We shared jokes, aspirations and mambo ya maisha. I got to learn of his humble beginnings and his quest to do well." Mutua further announced that Otile is currently completing a video of his new song, which features Tanzanian singer Darasa. He added that as a filmmaker and supporter of the arts, he is a believer in the financial growth of artistes. "The sky is the limit. I will support him and other Kenyan and East African artistes to grow and also receive their dues."
