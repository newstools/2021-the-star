A military plane crashed and broke up in flames in the southern Philippines on Sunday with 92 people aboard, and the army chief said at least 40 people had been rescued. The C-130 aircraft of the Philippine Air Force had a mishap on landing on the island of Jolo, the air force said in a statement. "Rescue efforts are ongoing," it said.
