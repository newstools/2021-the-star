ODM party leader Raila Odinga on Thursday visited the family of the late William Ole Ntimama following the passing of his widow, Mama Dorcas Ntimama. "She was the bedrock of her husband’s politics and matriarch to the Maa. Dorcas championed Maa culture and promoted the education of girls. May She Rest in Peace," Raila said on Twitter. Raila who was accompanied by Environment CS Keriako Tobiko and senator Ledama Ole Kina was seen with the family as he passed his condolences to the family. They later took pictures outside the home. Raila visited the family immediately he came back from Ethiopia. Raila who is the African Union High Representative for Infrastructure Development was in Ethiopia for a ministerial meeting for the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport corridor. Last week, president Uhuru Kenyatta sent a message of condolence to the family, relatives and friends of Mama Dorcas. In his message of comfort and encouragement, Uhuru described the late Mama Dorcas Ntimama as a gracious woman who worked tirelessly for the wellbeing of the society. “Mama Dorcas always built strong bonds of friendship, which ensured harmony and peace in her community,” he said. He wished the family of the Ntimama God's grace and comfort as they come to terms with her demise.
