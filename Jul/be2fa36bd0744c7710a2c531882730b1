Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has fought off claims of wrangles between him and other political leaders in his Ukambani backyard. Speaking when he hosted President Uhuru Kenyatta in Makueni on Friday, Kalonzo said claims that he has fallen out with governors from the region are false, adding that they have been peddled by the media. "I want to assure you that there are no differences at all among us leaders, " he said. He spoke in the presence of the three county bosses - Charity Ngilu (Kitui), Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni) and Alfred Mutua (Machakos). They hosted the President in Makueni where the head of state inspected the construction of the Thwake dam. But speaking moments after Kalonzo, Kibwana admitted that there have some 'small political differences' among them. He was however quick to state that they had put aside their differences. "We had some political problems. If we made grave mistakes, please forgive us," he said. Kalonzo also dismissed media reports that he and ODM leader Raila Odinga recently met at State House to discuss politics ahead of his visit to the region. "There is nothing like that but we can see the urge for unity and that is why we are promising you, Mr President," he said. He said that together with Raila and other leaders, "we are a big team".
