Former South African president Jacob Zuma has been granted permission to attend the burial of his younger brother, Michael, who is set to be buried on Thursday afternoon. "As a short-term, low risk classified inmate, Zuma’s application for compassionate leave was processed and approved," Correctional Services department spokesperson, Singabakho Nxumalo, said on Thursday. Zuma does not have to wear a prison uniform while on “compassionate leave”, with Nxumalo noting that inmates need not be in uniform when out of jail. The former president is currently serving a 15-month sentence in prison for contempt of court. His jailing sparked unrest in his home province KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng - where more than 200 people died and hundreds of shopping centres and businesses were ransacked.
