Manchester City are being priced out of the market for a new striker to replace Sergio Aguero and may just stick with what they have for the new season, manager Pep Guardiola said. British media reported City were interested in signing Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane or Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland after Aguero left the Premier League champions at the end of last season to join Barcelona as a free agent. Kane is valued at over 100 million pounds ($137.99 million), while Haaland has been rated at 150 million pounds. “At the prices (quoted) we are not going to buy any strikers. It is impossible, we cannot afford it,” Guardiola told Catalan network TV3. “All clubs are struggling financially, we are not an exception. We have Gabriel (Jesus) and Ferran (Torres) who have been incredible in this position. “We have young players in the academy and we play many times with a false nine. There is more of a chance we aren’t going to buy a striker for next season.” City begin their title defence on Aug. 15 when they travel to Tottenham.
