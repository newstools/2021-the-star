Kwale police are investigating a possible murder after a body was found floating at Chale beach in Ukunda on Friday. The body had decayed beyond recognition but police believe it is of a woman. County police commander Steve Oloo confirmed the incident. The police acted on a tip-off from terrified residents who spotted the unidentified body of a person straying freely on the ocean water. Police allege that the body might have been thrown in the area before being retrieved. "There is a possibility that it was tossed in the ocean and floated all the way to the place it was seen," Oloo said. So far, no suspect has been arrested and nothing recovered at the scene. The case is being investigated as undetermined death. Police couldn't give more details about the dead person who is yet to be identified. Oloo has called on the residents to relay any information that might help in the investigations and identification. "If there is anyone who lost a person in unclear circumstances, they should contact the police so that the body can be identified," he said. The body was taken to Coast General mortuary in Mombasa for autopsy. The incident comes amid abduction cases at the Coast where people who disappear are found dead. In June, a 19-year old girl who went missing in Mombasa, died at Port Reitz hospital after she was found unconscious in Bonje area by police officers. The deceased had sustained serious body injuries insinuating severe torture. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
