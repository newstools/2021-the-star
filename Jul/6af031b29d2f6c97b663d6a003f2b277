The Kenya County Government Workers Union has urged counties to pay employees on time to ensure prompt delivery of services. Union secretary general Roba Duba said it was wrong for employees to be subjected to unnecessary suffering as a result of delayed payment. Duba stated that all employees by law ought to be paid their salaries on the fifth day of every month but employees in various counties had gone for several months without pay. “We know there are challenges but please follow the law. The employment law states that if you engage an employee you must pay them on time for the services they have rendered because is their due and motivates them," Duba said. He made the remarks at the Bomet Water Company in Bomet town on Thursday during a session with management and its members ahead of signing a recognition agreement next week. Duba expressed dismay at what he called "unnecessary suffering" as a result of the Treasury's failure to release funds on time. Present were the union’s branch officials led by its secretary David Rono among others. Bomet water company MD Patrick Langat said the agreement with the union was a milestone and especially to the employees as they have not had one since the company started even years ago. The memorandum of understanding, he said, will provide guidelines on how the management and employees work together towards achieving good industrial and employee relations. (Edited by V. Graham)
