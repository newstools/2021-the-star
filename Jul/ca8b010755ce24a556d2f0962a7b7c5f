Hodiah Chepchirchir, the CEO at Chepchikoni Eateries, says she started cooking as a hobby. She has since turned it into a service and at 27, she has three joints and is planning to add 37 more in 12 years. In a recent interview, the young entrepreneur said she used to cook for bachelors. "I come to your house, cook your meals for a whole week, label it for you so you just pick and warm," she said. "I saved up and in 2019, I opened my first joint at Lumumba Drive and, there is one in an industrial area and one near USIU. I'm hoping to do 40 restaurants before I turn 40." She said she has positioned herself well. She has a manager, head chef and everything running smoothly, where if an investor comes on board, she would handle everything in the right manner. Chep made her first million at 26 years. She says Kenyan youth need to retire their egos, forget they have every qualification and start small, focusing on tomorrow. "I started my biashara with Sh50 after someone asked me to go and cook for him. God will either show us the path or the mountain top. So it is upon you to know what to do." She said men shouldn't be intimidated by successful women and all they need to do is be self-aware, be more supportive in all areas. "I have been in relationships where the guy didn't want to do stuff with me, he will provide but wouldnâ€™t want to spend quality time or even offer emotional support."
