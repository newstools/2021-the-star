Ninety-nine students and four teachers of Muruku Secondary School in Laikipia county have tested positive for Covid-19. This is after some 264 tests were done last Friday. According to Laikipia county director of communications Muchiri Gitonga, those infected have since been quarantined at the institution in Salama ward. Gitonga said the tests were done after some students developed coughing and breathing problems. "We sent our public health officers to the institution and today [Tuesday] we have confirmed that it is true the students and the teachers have tested positive. They have since been quarantined at the institution," Gitonga said. He added that health officials from the county government were taking care of them. "There is no serious case to worry about. Our health officers are on the lookout," he said. Learning for other students is still going on. "Everything is going on smoothly for other students who tested negative as the affected ones are in an isolated place," the official said. Edited by Henry Makori
