Vihiga County Governor Wilberforce Otichilo has challenged Vihiga Queens to match their performance in the Kenya Women’s Premier League and win the Cecafa trophy starting next week in Nairobi. Speaking on Wednesday during a media briefing at Kenya Institute of Special  Education, Kasarani, the county chief said: “We are here to ensure Vihiga are well prepared to face their opponents in Cecafa. We are proud of them and their achievements in the past four years." "Bagging the WPL title for three consecutive times is no mean feat for our Queens. They have blossomed locally and it’s time to show their mettle internationally. As the leadership of Vihiga, we are fully behind our team," he added. "I urge all Kenyans — this being an international tournament — to cheer the team wherever they are. I promise Sh1 million should they win. We are the only county with a sports fund in the entire nation and we are very proud to accommodate sports in our annual budget.” Otichilo urged the national government to invest more in sports to enable athletes realise their dreams. He said his government will pump more money to sports next year. “We are planning for another fund for performing arts. Vihiga is a cradle for football, athletics and other sports and therefore, we will increase our sports funding by 50 per cent in the next financial budget.” Queens captain Ines Mango said the team is ready for battle. “We are well equipped now to face our opponents and as a team we can’t wait to get started. We have enough quality to blossom in Cecafa,” said Mango. Coach Alex Alumira added: “In as much as the team is ready, we are waiting for the communication from FKF if the competition will go on as planned or not.”
