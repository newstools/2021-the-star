Kaiser, a high-end German Kitchen appliance firm is set to launch in Kenya, targeting the wider Eastern Africa region. Speaking exclusively to the Star, Emily Kawira, the firm's marketing head for Kenya said Kenya has a huge base of upper and middle class ready to put money on quality products and services. The family business founded in Central Berlin, Germany in 1995  is also looking to partner with home developers to supply built-in equipment for modern homes. ''Our products are designed to bridge the gap between upper and middle-income classes without compromising quality,'' Kawira said. The company’s entry into the Kenyan market comes at a time when local property developers are increasingly turning to China and India for house fittings such as ceramic tiles, fitted kitchens, wooden flooring and sanitary ware in a bid to woo high-end buyers and tenants. The firm with East African offices at Marchant Square, Westlands, Nairobi has ovens, refrigerators, hobs, cookers, cooker hoods. It also does premium German kitchen cabinets. The firm now joins other high-end kitchen appliance firms already established in Kenya including Borsch, Kohler and Singapore's Newmatic. The rise in popularity of imported fittings among high-end property developers has been attributed to their superior quality and their ability to lower building costs by up to 40 percent which translates to better returns on investment The Berlin-based firm is expected to launch its first showroom in Nairobi on August 14, bringing its Africa store portfolio to five following its presence in Senegal, Nigeria, South Africa and Ivory Coast.
