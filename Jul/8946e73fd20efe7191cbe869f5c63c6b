President Uhuru Kenyatta has been invited by the United Kingdom to co-host the Global Education Summit (GPE) with the UK in London on 28-29 July 2021. UK High Commission to Kenya Jane Marriott on Wednesday confirmed the event. “We’re excited to be welcoming President Kenyatta to the UK to co-host this vital summit,” Marriott said. The Summit is a key moment for the global community to come together and support quality education for all children. Also, the summit uses a hybrid format, with participants attending live sessions on GPE's virtual platform and a small in-person event in London. According to the summit, quality education provides all learners with the capacities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual wellbeing. In June, Uhuru congratulated UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for pledging £430 million (approximately Sh65 billion) towards the GPE campaign. The president said the announcement marked a momentous day for the Education campaign, which Kenya co-hosts alongside the UK. Uhuru said the pledge aligns with the emphasis and significance that the UK has placed on girls' education during its G7 Presidency. "Kenya is grateful to PM Boris Johnson and the UK for leading the call to fund Education and for rallying world leaders at the G7 and beyond to invest more in education as a way of leading the global recovery and building back better from the Covid-19 pandemic," he said. The president had said that the aim of the education financing conference is to raise 5 billion US dollars to ensure that all children, particularly those in developing countries, have equitable access to quality education.
