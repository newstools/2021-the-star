A 23-year-old Kenya Medical Training College student was found murdered in her rented hostel at Oriang estate in Homa Bay town on Sunday afternoon. The body of Emily Chepkemoi, a first-year clinical medicine student at Homa Bay town KMTC campus, was found lying in a pool of blood in her bed. Police are looking for her boyfriend, who has since switched off his phone. Neighbours who found the body said a pungent smell was emanating from Chepkemoi's house, prompting them to break down the door and check. They alerted police after they found the body. “We thought the student went home over the weekend since the door was locked. We were forced to break into the house to find out what was smelling,” a neighbour said. The student was last seen on campus on Friday evening after attending lessons. Homa Bay Township assistant chief Duncan Okech said the student was stabbed twice in the head and neck using a kitchen knife. The administrator said they suspect the student was murdered by her boyfriend on Friday night. “We’re trying to look for her boyfriend, who has since switched off his phone,” Okech said. On Monday, students’ union chairman David Odhiambo demanded justice and appealed to the police to expedite investigations. “The majority of students were shocked and did not attend lessons due to the incident. We’re mourning our colleague, but we appeal for justice,” Odhiambo said. Homa Bay Town DCI officer Monica Berege said they were following up on crucial leads that will ensure all the suspects are arrested. “Police officers are on the ground to ensure all the culprits are brought to book,” Berege said. The body was taken to Homa Bay Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem. Edited by A.N
