President Kaguta Yoweri Museveni has eulogised former Ugandan ICT Minister Aggrey Awori who died on Monday at the age of 82. Awori, who is the brother of former Kenyan Vice-President Moody Awori passed away at a private hospital in Naalya, Kampala, according to his close friend Peter Oguttu. On Wednesday, Museveni said that he was saddened by the death of Awori, whom he described as a talented sportsman and a distinguished leader. Museveni said that the late Awori joined him in National Resistance Movement (NRM) to serve the country despite their prior political differences. “My thoughts go out to the family, well-wishers, and the Samia Bagwe Community,” Museveni said through his Twitter account. Awori who was voted the best legislator in the Ugandan sixth Parliament lost to Stephen Mugeni Wasike in the subsequent election. He retired from active politics before President Yoweri Museveni appointed him a minister. The late Awori was Minister for Information and Communications Technology from February 16, 2009, to May 27, 2011. Several leaders inside and outside Uganda are still sending their condolences to Awori’s family. On Tuesday, ODM leader Raila Odinga and his wife Ida described Awori as a true manifestation of East African Integration and Pan Africanism. "We join the Awori family and people from all around the region in giving thanks for Aggrey's remarkable life of service particularly to Kenya and Uganda," Raila said. Raila noted the close relationship their families have had that began with their fathers, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and Jeremiah Musungu Awori. "At the University of Nairobi, he was an avid debater on issues of the day in Kenya and Uganda," Raila said.
