The national women's volleyball team, Malkia Strikers, will be the first Kenyan Olympians to depart for the July 23-August 8 Tokyo Olympics. The first batch of the volleyballers will leave the country on Thursday for a pre-Olympics camp in Kurume City in Japan before the second delegation departs on Friday alongside an initial delegation of the national men's rugby Sevens team. Both groups will be preceded by the Chef-de-Mission team, led by  Waithaka Kioni, who will be attending a Delegates' Registration Meeting in Tokyo to lay the groundwork for the teams' arrivals in Japan. The last delegation to depart the country will be middle and long-distance athletes — including marathoners and race walkers — who will travel between July 23 and August 2. Nonetheless, the sprinters' duo of Ferdinand Omanyala and Mark Otieno as well as Hellen Syombua (400m) and Emmanuel Korir (400m) will travel in a week's time. Olympics Kenya Acting secretary general Francis Mutuku said the travel itinerary was developed in consideration of the prevailing coronavirus pandemic around the globe. "The teams have been divided into small travel parties in order to manage the risks of Covid-19 infection which may force a team to be quarantined, as well as in accordance with the period of stay guidelines by the organisers," Mutuku said.
