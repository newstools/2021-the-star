The Water ministry has agreed to meet stakeholders and discuss concerns the proposed Malewa Dam will kill Lake Naivasha. Flower farmers and experts have warned that the dam in Nyandarua county could lead to the collapse of the horticulture sector. Water CS Sicily Kariuki said she will engage stakeholders in the water source and the end users to reach a compromise. Sicily said the dam was the long-term solution to the water crisis in Naivasha, Gilgil and parts of Nakuru town. “We shall be seeking fresh public participation on this dam that has a lot of interest and has raised a lot of concern from various stakeholders,” she said. The CS said that plans were underway to construct two more dams in Nyandarua to address the water needs of residents. “Designs for Pesi and Kinja dams are already out and we have partners who are willing to fund these projects in the coming year,” she said. Sicily spoke in Naivasha after inspecting construction of a pipeline to supply water to the Industrial Park in Mai Mahiu. She said the pipeline was ready to begin supply as the five boreholes in Naivasha would be pumping over 6,000 cubic meters of water to the park every day. Sicily said residents of Naivasha, Longonot and Mai Mahiu will get water through the pipeline. “In the next 21 days, five water kiosks will be constructed along the pipeline to assist communities along the line,” she said. Last month, the Dutch Embassy said it would fund a study on the effects of Malewa dam on Lake Naivasha and the communities downstream. Dutch Ambassador Maarten Brouwer made the remark when he met environmentalists, county and national officials to find a solution on the matter. The forums heard that the three towns needed chloride-free water but not at the expense of the lake. The flower farms depend on Lake Naivasha.  (edited by o. owino)
