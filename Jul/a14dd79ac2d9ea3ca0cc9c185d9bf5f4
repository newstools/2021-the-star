More senior police officers have retired, triggering changes in the National Police Service. Among those who retired is Charles Karege, principal assistant to the Deputy Inspector General of Administration Police Service. He was replaced by James Akoru. The commandant of the Administration Police Training College in Embakasi Musa Kakawa also retired and was replaced by Mukuha Kamau. The new commandant of the Rapid Deployment Unit is Okech Owino. The changes were announced DIG APS Noor Gabow. In the Kenya Police, Rift Valley Regional Police Commander Mercus Ochola took his terminal leave on July 1 pending his retirement. Robinson Mboloi is the acting regional police boss. Elsewhere, two senior Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers retired after serving for more than 40 years. The director of investigations bureau John Kariuki and head of operations Henry Ondiek bowed out of the service after attaining their retirement ages. Carrey Nyawinda will act as the director of investigations while Bernard Gicheru will act as the director of operations. This was after the DCI George Kinoti approved the move. “I wish you well as you continue to serve the members of the public and for those whom I may have crossed sword for one reason of the other be assured there was nothing personal and count it as job hazards,” said Kariuki in his letter to his colleagues at the service. He said he had served for 33 years. Ondiek said he had served for record 41 years and attributed it to cooperation between various players in the service. “I appreciate all my colleagues, both uniformed and non-uniformed for support, encouragement and providing a shoulder to lean on,” he said in a memo to his colleagues. More senior officers are set to retire from the service this year. A planned reshuffle of the senior officers following the exits is pending. Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai congratulated them for the service they offered.
