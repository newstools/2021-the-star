Agriculture CS Peter Munya has called on the new KTDA Holdings Board to move with speed in executing actions and strategies that will accord farmers enhanced earnings and get the sub-sector back to the sustainability and profitability path. Speaking at an induction ceremony for the new board at a Nairobi hotel on Wednesday, Munya said the new board has taken up the new leadership mantle against the backdrop of ongoing reforms. He added that there is increased expectation to refocus the businesses objectives to serve the interest of farmers. “As you assume office, it is important for you to recognize that you are taking up your responsibilities on the platform of reform and transformation, amidst high expectations from the shareholders and farmers who for a long time have suffered in the hands of poor leadership. "The most important responsibility that you have is to restore the original mandate of KTDA Holdings Ltd, which is executed through the KTDA Management Services Ltd and to refocus the respective subsidiaries towards serving farmers’ interests and delivering value to shareholders,” Munya said. The CS reiterated the government’s commitment to continue facilitating policy support in the sub-sector. He cautioned that the effectiveness of the government’s support will only be realized if there is reciprocation from stakeholders. “The Government will continue facilitating policy support as well as the promotion and marketing strategy through the Tea Board of Kenya. However, Government support will only make sense if KTDA Holdings Ltd, which has the mandate of managing tea for the smallholder sub-sector plays its part,” he said.
