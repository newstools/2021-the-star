A Kajiado herder was recently arraigned before Kibera court after he was found in possession of a carcass belonging to a wildlife species. The court heard from the particulars that the accused person Ladapash was in the company of others not before the court when he was nabbed with a five-kilo carcass of a dik dik on June, 26th at about 7:30 pm at Saikeri location within Kajiado County. Lapadash was on the day herding goats belonging to his employer. He was walking with his dogs while herding the goats. Unfortunately, the dogs saw the dik dik and went after it. They caught the dik dik and killed it. Lapadash tried to rescue it but it was already dead. He then snatched the carcass with intention of cutting it into pieces to feed his dog when he was found by officers from the Kenya Wildlife Services. He was arrested and taken to Kiserian Police station. He denied the charges when he appeared before senior resident magistrate Charles Mwaniki, saying that his dog killed it before he realised it. He was granted a bond of Sh100,000 with alternative cash bail of Sh50,000. The carcass that had been presented in court as evidence was photographed for future use before it was disposed of. The matter shall be mentioned on July 14.
