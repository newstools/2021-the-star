National Under-20 10,000m race walk champion Harrington Wanyonyi is optimistic of delivering a medal for Kenya at the World Under 20 athletics championships set for August 17 to 22 at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. As the sole representative in men’s walk, Wanyonyi, who completed his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) at Ortum Boys in April said that life has changed for the better after joining the camp where he has access to modern training facilities. The two-time Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) silver medalist, who won both the pre-trials and the trials, said: “This is the right time for me to improve tremendously in race walk since I have good training facilities." Wanyonyi, from West Pokot, used to travel all the way to Kenyatta Stadium in Kitale, Trans Nzoia County for speed work but in Nairobi, the facilities are readily available. Wanyonyi will be representing Kenya internationally for the first time but he believes he has done enough to be competitive. “I have high expectations. However, I need to work on a few tactics,” added Wanyonyi from his base at Sports View Hotel, Kasarani, where the junior team is camping. Margaret Gati will be Kenyan's sole representative in the corresponding women's race walk.
