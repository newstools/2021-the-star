Socialite turned businesswoman Vera Sidika has revealed she quit alcohol last year. Taking to Insta stories, the mum-to-be said she stopped drinking after she met her now hubby Brown Mauzo. She added that she was not a heavy drinker but only imbibed while clubbing. "The last time I had alcohol was in March 2020. Yup. I wasn't much of a drinker, though. I'm a social drinker, only when clubbing. So since corona last year I hadn't clubbed. Therefore, no alcohol," she said. "Then came my hubby in August, God sent me a man that's never tasted alcohol his entire life. Which made it even easier to forget. It's been one and a half years now. Wow. I stopped drinking way back before I even got pregnant."
