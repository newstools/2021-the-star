Thirteen people died on Saturday night after a fuel tanker burst into flames along the Kisumu- Busia road. According to Gem subcounty Police commander Charles Chacha, the accident happened at around 10.45 pm in Malanga Village. Chacha told the Star that 11 people, including children escaped with serious injuries from the fire and are receiving treatment at the Yala subcounty hospital where they were rushed after the accident. The Police boss said that a trailer, registration number KAV 768 W was avoiding a head-on collision with the fuel tanker from Kisumu when the accident occurred. "The trailer which was ferrying 20 tonnes of milk, veered off the road to avoid plunging into the tanker which was heading to Busia," he said. The OCPD said that the tanker however hit the trailer and rolled emptying its content by the roadside. He said that members of the public, oblivious of the lurking danger rushed to the accident scene to siphon fuel. "The tanker hit the vehicle on the right rear side. As a result of the impact, it overturned on the extreme left side of the road," he said. He added that members of the public quickly gathered at the scene of the accident and began siphoning fuel. " Moments later, the fuel tanker burst into flames. We have counted at least twelve bodies at the scene. Eleven casualties were rushed to the nearby Yala subcounty hospital for treatment," he said. It took three hours to contain the inferno according to the OCPD with the help of the fire brigade from Busia County. He said the firefighters from Siaya county lacked the required equipment to respond to the accident.
