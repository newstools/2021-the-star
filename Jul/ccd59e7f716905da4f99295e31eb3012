The African Union Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat has called for an urgent need to restore peace in South Africa as protests intensify. In a statement, Faki condemned in the strongest terms the surge of violence that has resulted in the deaths of civilians and appalling scenes of the looting of public and private property. The situation has led to the suspension of essential services in Kwazulu-Natal, Gauteng provinces, and other parts of South Africa. At the same time, Faki has extended his deepest condolences to the families of the victims and wishes a rapid and full recovery to the wounded. The chairperson called for an urgent restoration of order, peace, and stability in the country in full respect of the rule of law. Also, the chairperson has stressed that failure to do so can have grave impacts not only in the country but the entire region as a whole. He reiterated the full and unwavering solidarity of the African Union Commission with the government and people of South Africa. By Wednesday, 72 people were confirmed to have died in the ongoing protests which are being witnessed in some parts of the country. The chaos erupted on Thursday when former President Jacob Zuma surrendered to the police after being sentenced to 15 months in jail for court contempt.

It asked its citizens to avoid unnecessary travel to KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces.
