Two people were on Saturday morning killed at Railway estate in Homa Bay town after a trailer crashed a house they were sleeping in. Joseph Ondiegi,72, and Dianna Odero,13, died on the spot. The vehicle lost direction and hit a mabati wall fence before crashing the house and killing them. Two people from the same family Samson Odero and Clinton Odero also suffered serious injuries. Their brother Nashon Onyango and neighbour Judith Awuor said the incident occurred around 4 am. “Some neighbours together with the police assisted us to extract two bodies between the rare tires of the trailer,” Onyango said. “Police also rushed the injured persons to Homa Bay Referral Hospital for medication.” Homa Bay township chief Joshua Ochogo and his assistant Duncan Okech said the trailer was travelling from Kendu Bay to Homa Bay direction. It was loaded and ferrying bags of cement. Ochogo said they believe the driver lost control of the vehicle before crashing the wall as he was unable to negotiate a corner. “The driver disappeared after the incident. The trailer belongs to Rai cement factory,” Ochogo said. About four house structures were also destroyed. Homa Bay Central MCA Julius Nyambok asked the county disaster management department to support the affected families. “We’re also appealing for the government to consider constructing bumps on the road to check on speed,” Nyambok said. Homa Bay Town police commander Sammy Kosgey said they have cordoned the area and investigating the matter. “We’re liaising with the leadership of the company about the accident,” Kosgey said. “We’re also looking for the driver to come and record a statement.” Edited by Kiilu Damaris
