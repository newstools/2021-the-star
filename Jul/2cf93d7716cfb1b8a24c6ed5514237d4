The Southern African Development Community (SADC) organ on politics, defence, and security has issued its statement following a fact-finding mission in troubled Eswatini, formally known as Swaziland. Eswatini has witnessed protest over the past weeks as citizens demand major constitutional reforms in the only country that practices absolute monarchy in Africa. SADC’s chairperson Mokgweetsi Masisi, who is the President of Botswana said the team’s mission was to gather first-hand information on the disturbances, including the state of security in the country, and to appeal for calm and restraint from all the stakeholders. The fact-finding mission team constituted Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Republics of Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The mission was led by Lemogang Kwape, Minister of International Affairs of Botswana, in his capacity as the Chairperson of the SADC Ministerial Committee of the Organ. The mission held consultations with the government of Eswatini, and made attempts to meet with a broad spectrum of other stakeholders across the country. “Due to the short notice, it was not possible to reach many of the stakeholders. As a result, it was agreed that a second Mission will be dispatched urgently to Eswatini to continue the consultation process with the other stakeholders in the country,” the statement read. The mission held a short meeting with a few civil society organisations to assure them of a second mission to the country to hold further consultations with all other key stakeholders. Masisi said that all the consultations were held in an atmosphere of calm, mutual respect and understanding. “There was a clear sense of urgency to address the situation in the country. The proposal for an open national dialogue was highly welcomed as a way forward towards finding a long-lasting solution.” On Monday, Acting Prime Minister Themba Masuku urged emaSwati to return to work and reopen unaffected businesses as the Kingdom returns to normalcy.
