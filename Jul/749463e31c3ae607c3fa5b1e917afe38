The trial proceedings of Migori Governor Okoth Obado in the murder of Sharon Otieno and her unborn baby has kicked off. The trial began with government pathologist Dr Johansen Oduor testifying as the first witness. During his submission, Oduor said there were seven stab wounds and two slash wounds on Sharon's body. “There was muscle bleeding on the left side of the neck and muscle was detached from the attachment on the bone,” he said. “Bleeding seen on the root of the tongue and right lung had collapsed.” The pathologist noted that there was a stab wound on Sharon’s lower abdomen adding that intestines were sticking out. “There were stab wounds on her back; mid-back, right and left lower back. Multiple aberrations on the back, neck, upper chest, shoulder, flank and upper and lower limbs.” He said that Sharon’s clothes were given to him separately adding that they were not on her. “The body was flaccid; the skin was slipping off the back of the arms & legs. There was a slash wound below the left ear & another slash wound below the first,” he said. In the case, Obado, Juma Oyamo and Casper Obiero are accused of killing Sharon Otieno and her unborn child on September 3, 2018, at Owade in Rachuonyo subcounty, Homa Bay county. Sharon was 26. Defence counsels led by Kioko Kilukumi, Rodgers Sagana, Tom Ojienda and Elisha Ongoya had asked the court to adjourn the matter because the suspects reside in Migori, now a Covid hotspot. Their concern was that the Delta variant, which is responsible for the infection wave in Western and Nyanza, is highly transmissible.
