Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has offered to adopt and raise the children of the late police corporal Caroline Kangogo. Hours after the fugitive cop was found dead at her parent's home in Elgeyo Marakwet on Friday, Sonko now says he is ready to take care of Kangogo's two children aged eleven and eight years. "My special request to her innocent family in Elgeyo Marakwet kama mutalemewa kusomesha au kulea watoto wake please give them to me nikae nao nitawasomesha na kuwalea. Children are a blessing from God," Sonko posted on his social media pages. The former governor said though he didn't advocate for what Kangogo did, the late cop was 'hunted like a devil' through the media. "What other justice was she to get? If the public caught her, they would have lynched her without getting her side of the story because her case has been investigated and prosecuted through the court of public opinion. Now that she's no more everyone is sympathising with her," Sonko said. The ex-governor thanked lawyers John Khaminwa and Cliff Ombetta for trying to reach out to her for assistance. "Whether she committed suicide or was killed, depression is real and the same predicament can befall anyone. RIP Carolyn Kangongo," Sonko said. A confession note allegedly authored by Kangogo - accused of killing two people - emerged, hours after her body was found. The DCI said she committed suicide. In a long draft text message, Kangogo said she suffered depression and lamented about her husband, whom she accused of philandering and neglecting her and her children. The message appeared meant for her brother as she asked him and her parents to take care of her children because "their father is too much into women". Kangogo asked that she be buried at her parents' home because her husband 'dumped' her. Police say Kangogo shot herself at about 7.30 am Friday at Nyawa village, Tambach division in Keiyo. Her parents called the police who found the body in a pool of blood in the bathroom.
