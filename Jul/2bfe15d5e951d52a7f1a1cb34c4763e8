Former Prime Minister, Raila Odinga on Thursday met the Orange party’s top leadership at Chungwa house. In a statement, the party said Raila held discussions with his deputy party leader and Kakamega Governor, Wycliffe Oparanya and Secretary-general Edwin Sifuna. Issues discussed during the meeting focused on strengthening the party in the Western Kenya region. "The talks centered on current developments in Western Kenya and the rejuvenation of the party in all the 5 Counties of the region #TukoTayari," ODM tweeted. The meeting comes a day after the Orange party announced free membership registration for the next three months. Secretary-general, Edwin Sifuna said the waiver came about after many people asked the party to remove the Sh100 required for ordinary membership registration due to the current economic situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. "The Party Leader HE. Hon. Raila Amolo Odinga has directed my office to waive the membership fee for anyone wishing to join our party in the next three months beginning 1st July, 2021," Sifuna said in a letter to County Chairpersons. He called on the Orange party supporters to use the three-month free registration window to sign up as members of the party, a move that will allow them to participate in the grassroots elections and nominations. This is the second time the ODM leader is holding a meeting at his party headquarters since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Kenya. May 26, 2021 was the first time Raila visited the Chungwa House offices since the first lockdown after cases of Covid-19 were reported in the country. In a statement, ODM said that the party leadership discussed matters that directly affected the party, as well as other national issues. "PL  @RailaOdinga today at Chungwa House held a meeting with top party officials; Chairman  @MbadiHon Sec. Gen. @edwinsifuna and National Treasurer Timothy Bosire," ODM said.
