US-based singer Izzo has featured V. Rose in his new hit Keep Waiting. Speaking to Word Is, Izzo said the two met online and then started talking about working on a project together. "It was a process because I had to go through her management and follow all the procedures. But eventually, things worked out and we have this beautiful project together. She recorded her parts and I recorded mine with 12th Note productions." The two artists live in Texas so that made the process easier. "We’re currently planning on working on the music video and arrange to have her in my city so we’re looking forward to that," he said. Izzo said the song encourages fans who are going through hard times during the Covid-19 pandemic. "It might take time for you to achieve what you are working on but keep trusting God, eventually you will get it," he said.
