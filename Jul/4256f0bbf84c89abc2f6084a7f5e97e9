A sharp rift between Bungoma MCAs and the executive played out during a  funeral service that ended prematurely in chaos. Drama started when MCAs allied to Governor Wycliffe Wangamati accused Sitikho MCA Grace Sundukwa of sabotaging his administration . Wangamati was attending the funeral of Mama Selina Soita, mother to former councillor Patroba Soita in Sitikho village, Webuye. Pro-Wangamati MCAs hurled accusations at their rival camp that supports Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula, calling on them to stop daydreaming of another regime of Kenneth Lusaka as governor. Hell broke loose when the host MCA Sundukwa took the microphone to address the mourners. She told accused the MCAs in the governor's entourage of misleading him. "Governor,  these MCAs following you aren't telling you the truth. They are misleading you. They should  be committed to affairs in their respective wards as mandated by voters," the charged Ford Kenya MCA said. "The role of MCAs is not cheerleading and clapping  for the governor, " she added. She accused the CECs of using their office to sabotage projects in regions that oppose the regime, hence punishing the voters. Sundukwa,  a first time MCA, further accused Deputy Governor Charles Ngome of using vulgar language in funerals. "It's a disgrace for a leader of the stature of deputy governor who is even supposed to be my father to speak vulgarity and bedroom matters before the public," said Sundukwa. A shouting march ensued as irate MCA engaged in a 30-minute scuffle. Police stepped in to stop the warring sides from turning the funeral more chaotic. Speaking to the Star  on phone,  Sundukwa condemned the chaos and disrespect upon the family of the deceased saying Luhyas always have total respect at funerals. She asked Wangamati's supporters to also stop violence against young elected women. Ndivisi Ward MCA Martin Wanyonyi also condemned the incident. Edited by Henry Makori
