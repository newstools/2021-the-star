Erstwhile school games football giants Kakamega High School will bounce back with a bang when competition ultimately resumes after the prolonged Covid-19 break, head coach Eliud Omukuyia has said. Omukuiya revealed they are burning the midnight oil to restore the school's lost glory on the national stage. Popularly known as the Green Commandos, the school dominated the scenes especially in the 80s and 90s, producing some of the best names in local top flight football. “Our objective is one and everyone understands his role as we believe the team has the right qualities.  I want to salute the school administration and the alumni association for the support," he said. “We want to start on a high note once the school games resume. The boys are hungry and thirsty for success but I want us to remain patient and cross the bridge when we reach there,” noted Omukuyia. "I’m very much impressed with the quality within our ranks and from the experience I have gathered from this school, we have the right material to produce the success that has remained elusive for the last few years,” he added Omukuiya's assistant, Hesborn Nyabinge, remains optimistic they will retain their status in the national Division One league, and probably come out strongly next season in their renewed quest and promotion to the National Super League. The Green Commandos’ chairman Isaac Kwoba believes the team has what it takes to succeed, adding they will continue to work closely with the school and other partners to ensure the ongoing renovation of their pitch concludes in good time. Kwoba warned the disgruntled voices against painting the administration of the school in bad light and called for well-wishers to come on board and support the team to realise their dream.
