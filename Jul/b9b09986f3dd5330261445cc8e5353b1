Some West Pokot leaders are laying the ground for a regional party to be used in next year's elections. The leaders said they have been supporting other political parties, but the time has come for them to form their own. Speaking to press in Kapenguria, Pokot South MP David Pkosing said the process had already begun and they are in the public participation stage. “The Pokot community wants to have a strong political bargaining power in the government with their own party,” he said. The MP said they have already put in place structures and West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo will be the party leader. “I will be the deputy party leader and we are in talks with other pastoral communities to join the outfit,” he said. “We want to be at the table and bargain for our rights; we don’t want other people to push for our rights.” The MP asked residents to support the move, saying it will benefit the community. The party plan has been criticised by some leaders from the county on grounds it will lack national representation. Senator Samuel Poghisio asked residents to support parties that are already established, and not to rush and join a new one without a vision. “Anybody has the right to register a political party, but public funds should not be used in the process,” he said. Devolution PS Micah Powon said small parties won’t help in solving challenges facing the community. “The party won’t have a national face and it will be only a party in this region. I urge our people to support parties that are already in place,” he said. Powon said regional parties cannot form a government and cannot be considered among influential Opposition outfits. “This is just a waste of time and resources,” he said. -Edited by SKanyara
