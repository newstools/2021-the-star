The Muslim community in Kenya marked the Eid-ul-Adha on Tuesday. On Friday last week, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i declared July 20 a public holiday to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha. The holiday is an Islamic festival to commemorate the willingness of Ibrahim to follow Allah's command to sacrifice his son. Eid-ul-Adha is held at the end of the Hajj pilgrimage and sees family and friends gather for feasts, gift-giving and prayers. On Monday, Deputy President William Ruto distributed a herd of goats to the Muslim community ahead of the celebrations. Ruto handed over the gift in Nyali, Mombasa County to Sheikh Hassan Omar, who is the National Treasurer Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya. "We salute the Muslim fraternity around the world as they observe Eid al-Adha. This is the celebration to honour the sacrifice and devotion to God. May this special Holy day bring love and inspire us to work for the wellbeing of everyone. Happy Eid al-Adha!" Ruto said. Other national leaders including former Prime Minister Raila Odinga wished the community well, as they mark this very important day.
