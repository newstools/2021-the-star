Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi has dismissed claims that he is at war with Governor Wilber Ottichilo. He said the hurdles Ottichilo is encountering in his administration have been engineered by the governor himself. Saisi said he is being treated as an enemy of Ottichilo’s administration after he declared he will not work with the governor in next year's general election. The deputy governor has said he might contest for the gubernatorial seat in 2022. “The governor is being fought by people who were fired from his administration,” Saisi said. But Ottichilo said those who were fired were dismissed on various grounds. Lat month, the governor sacked four county executives. “The county assembly recommended the dismissal of the four executives –  Pamela Kimwele (public service and administration), Paul Mbuni (lands), Kenneth Keseko (trade) and Amos Kutwa hHealth) – after they concluded investigations under an ad hoc committee,” Ottichilo said. He said he only acted on the assembly's recommendations. Saisi said he led talks between MCAs and the governor in regard to an  impeachment motion against Ottichilo. “MCAs had tabled an impeachment motion in the assembly seeking to impeach the governor. We were only just one year in the office and we had to convince them. They listened,” Saisi said. “I don't understand why guns are being turned on me, that I'm frustrating Ottichilo’s administration.”  Edited by A.N
