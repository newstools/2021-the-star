A robbery suspect was on Tuesday morning killed and a firearm recovered by police on patrol in Kasarani. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the suspect whose name was not revealed had attempted to escape using a getaway motorcycle before the police caught up with him. "Early today morning, Police Officers on patrol recovered a firearm from a gangster in Kasarani, who had just accosted a pedestrian on her way to work," DCI said in a statement. The suspect fell from the motorcycle after the Police land cruiser caught up with them. Determined to escape, he engaged the police in a shoot out before a bullet from police who returned fire hit him. "Unbowed and determined to escape from the long arm of the law, the suspect began firing at the Police vehicle that had screeched to a halt. His mistake turned costly. It only took the response from one of the officers aboard the truck to immobilize him, by injuring him fatally," DCI said. The Police said they believe the suspect is part of a bigger group that is connected to a shooting incident where a man was shot on the right arm on Monday night, at the Githurai roundabout. The thugs who were on a motorbike had just snatched a hand bag from a lady who was walking home, before they opened fire on members of the public who tried to intervene. The injured man was rushed to St John’s hospital in Githurai, where he was treated and referred to Kiambu Level 5 hospital for specialised medical attention. This comes a mid concern by Kenyans over increasing cases of theft by thugs using motorcycles. Some of the thugs have been snatching phones from unsuspecting Kenyans in different Nairobi estates.
