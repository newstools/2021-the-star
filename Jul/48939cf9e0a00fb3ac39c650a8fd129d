West Pokot county is working on measures to achieve zero mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Speaking in Kapenguria on Monday, Governor John Lonyangapuo said a team of technocrats from the Department of Health and AMPATH is working on a proposal to provide a framework for the fight against HIV/Aids. Lonyangapuo said the five-year programme will be rolled out in October. He thanked AMPATH for collaborating with the county to help address the burden of HIV/Aids. “Ampath has been great in helping us fight the burden of HIV/Aids. They are helping us to ensure that we have zero mother-to-child transmission and I am optimistic we shall achieve this target,” Lonyangapuo said. He said his administration was focusing on treatment, care and prevention of the disease. The governor called on residents to be champions in the fight against the spread of the HIV/Aids epidemic by getting tested. AMPATH Plus led by coordinator Prof Sylvester Kimaiyo said the programme integrates zero new infections and zero discrimination. Kimaiyo said the project involves aspects like advising mothers on nutrition, self-disclosure as well as advice on how to help ensure children are not infected despite their mothers’ living with HIV. “The work is done through a network of caregivers and mother-to-mother support groups, which resulted in positive indicators. Because of limited resources we welcome partners to help us achieve our goal towards elimination of HIV in this county,” he said. He asked residents not to discriminate against those infected but offer them the support they need.  Edited by Henry Makori
