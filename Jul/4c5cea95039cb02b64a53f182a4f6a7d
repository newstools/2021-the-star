Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot has criticised remarks made by ODM leader Raila Odinga over the weekend regarding how he would deal with corruption if elected as president. In a post on Monday through his Twitter account, Cheruiyot said that the Constitution of Kenya has an independent institution that is mandated to deal with corruption. Though the senator did not mention the ODM leader in his post, the comment was directly linked with Raila’s remarks at the coastal region. Raila had said that he will ensure that corrupt leaders in the Jubilee government are sentenced, and none will be spared. In his tweet, Cheruiyot said fighting corruption is not any politician's job, least of all a president. He added that MCAs and MPs can at most do their oversight role but constitutionally, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is the only body mandated to probe such cases. “Constitutionally, it is the mandate of EACC. What presidential candidates should promise Kenyans is that they will not use EACC to fight political battles. That's it,” Senator said. On Saturday, Raila kept up his attacks on Deputy President William Ruto over his mega cash donations to churches and welfare groups. Without mentioning the DP by name, Raila questioned the source of the donations, alleging the monies are proceeds of corruption that has taken root in the Jubilee administration. “He wants to do harambees for women's groups and youth groups with cash stuffed in sacks. He goes to church. Then they say he respects God. But he is coming with your money,” Raila said in Mombasa. “You are being bought with stolen money,” the former prime minister said.
