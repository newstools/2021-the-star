Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua and his Nyandarua counterpart Francis Kimemia have agreed to work together towards building cooperation between the two counties. In a meeting on Thursday held at Kimemia's office, the two leaders agreed to boost trade cooperation through mutual beneficial deals. Speaking after the meeting, Governor Mutua said the two have scheduled a meeting of executives from both counties to sign a memorandum of understanding on areas of mutual partnership. "By virtue of our positions we discussed modalities to enhance inter-county trade, identification of priority projects of the blocs, marketing of the blocs as key investment zones and infrastructure development to expand rural road networks for ease of doing business and movement of people," Mutua said. "I am optimistic this will be a silver bullet to change the fortunes of our regions and turnaround the lives of our people." During the press briefing, Mutua also urged politicians to avoid being tribal with the political parties theyÂ  stand for. "We need to build political institutions based on ideology and choose leaders bearing in mind what they stand for corresponds with the desire of wananchi," "Kenya has come of age for us to shake off obsession of rallying behind political parties because they represent our tribes. It's time we started interrogating what ideology they stand for."
