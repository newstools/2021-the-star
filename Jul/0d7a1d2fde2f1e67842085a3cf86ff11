All 45 passengers aboard a Skyward Express flight from Nairobi to Mandera survived unhurt when the aircraft crash-landed in a military base in Somalia. The plane, registration number 5Y-GRS, landed at Burahache military camp, El Wak, Gedo region in Somalia near the border with Kenya. The plane had left Wilson Airport on Wednesday morning but suffered a mechanical problem, forcing the pilot to land. Officials said investigators from the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority would visit the site to probe the accident. KCAA director general Gilbert Kibe said they were working to establish the cause of the incident. "It was near the Kenya-Somalia border at El Wak airstrip and we are investigating it. No injuries reported so far," he said. Photos from the scene showed some soldiers talking to the passengers and the plane on its belly. Plans were underway to transfer the passengers to their destination, an official said. Skyward officials in Nairobi promised to issue a statement after getting more information on the incident. Nasra Bashir Ali, a press attaché to the Somali prime minister's office, said the passenger plane carrying 45 people went out of the runway at El Wak airstrip. “No one was hurt in the accident,” she said on her Twitter.
