The Ministry of Health has launched the Emergency Medical Care Policy 2020-2030 aimed at strengthening structures to meet the multifaceted demands. Health CS Dr Rashid Aman launched the policy on Wednesday, saying that the policy aims at establishing a vibrant Emergency Medical Care system as a key component of Kenya’s health care system and as an enabler to achieving UHC. “The Emergency Medical Care policy is a precursor to the creation of an Emergency Medical Fund as a fulfilment of National assembly resolution that Ministry of Health sets up an EMC fund to assist those in emergency treatment, “Aman said. Aman said implementation of the policy focuses on priority areas such as investment in EMC infrastructure, Emergency Command and Control Centers; Ambulance Coordination System and dispatch centres; information and communication technology, as well as strengthening leadership and governance at all levels. The CS also inaugurated the emergency medical care steering committee. In his speech, Aman said that at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry initiated a single short-code toll-free emergency access number, 719 which was supported by a dedicated 24-hour. Aman said the dedicated Covid-19 ambulances were also dispatched through the same service to provide emergency care and evacuation for patients across the country to dedicated treatment centres.
