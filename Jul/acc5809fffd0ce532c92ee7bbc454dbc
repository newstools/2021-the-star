Socialite Vera Sidika is on the spot after comedian Akuku Danger accused her of failing to pay for services provided at her baby's gender-reveal party. The comedian said he provided the sound equipment at the party but Vera did not pay him in full. He said the two had agreed on a Sh15,000 fee for one hour and she proceeded to send a deposit of Sh10,000. “For some of us, it's the small money that makes a difference in our livelihoods. I'm kindly asking you to pay me my balance of Sh5,000, which rightfully belongs to me!” he posted on Instagram. He explained he was mistreated at the hotel and even later thrown out of the venue. “Trust me, I'd let the Sh5,000 slide, but it's the disrespect you showed me and my team last night that makes me do this," he said. "Imagine leaving the venue at 1 am past curfew hours and the police caught up with us. To cut the long story short, even the Sh10,000 you paid me ended up going down the drain. Now I'm in arrears coz now my team also are demanding payment from me. What do you want me to do?” Responding to the allegations, Vera threw shade at the Churchill Show comedian, accusing him of lying to the public. Vera said the comedian bargained for Sh10,000 but upon reaching the venue, he changed tune, demanding an additional Sh5,000. She went on to mock the funnyman, stating that she had never heard of him until yesterday, when her PA mentioned it to her.
