Immediate former AFC Leopards skipper Robinson Kamura has urged his teammates to surmount the challenges they've experienced in recent months in order to prevail in their Betway Cup final against Gor Mahia at Nyayo Stadium on Sunday. Kamura, who was last week demoted from his role as captain and replaced by Isaac Kipyegon in changes rang by head coach Patrick Aussems, played down his predicament. He has since termed his recent spate of setbacks as enough motivation to propel him towards greater things going forward. “There's something that will never change and that is I will always and forever be a leopard. “Tomorrow is a big day for u. I wish I was there but again like I always tell you, Our happy thoughts will one day become our reality and that could be tomorrow (Sunday). “I believe and I trust we all have what it takes to rise up to the occasion and the good Lord will see us through as a team. We have gone through so many challenges together but we overcame them and this will motivate us tomorrow and bring happiness to the blue nation. All the best my champs,” said Kamura. The 13-time Kenyan champions will look to lay claim to a major silverware after narrowly missing out on an opportunity to secure a slot in the Caf Champions League. The winners of Sunday's encounter will book a direct berth as the country's representatives in the next season's Caf Confederations Cup.
