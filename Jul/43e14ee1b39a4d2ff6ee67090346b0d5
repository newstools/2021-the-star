Three suspected armed robbers were on Thursday night killed in a shootout with police in Buruburu. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the trio was spotted riding on an unmarked motorcycle along Outer Ring road past curfew hours. The suspects allegedly sped off after they were beckoned to stop by the Buruburu-based police officers on patrol. "A hot chase ensued before the suspects were intercepted at Saika stage, where they abandoned the motorcycle and took to their heels," the DCI said. The police report indicated that the suspects were ambushed by a backup team of officers from Obama and Kayole stations at the Mwengenye-Dandora bridge. "Cornered and defying surrender orders, one of the suspects dressed in a jungle tactical gear brandished a Pistol, which prompted an immediate response from the police which left the trio fatally injured," the DCI said. The Crime Scene Investigations detectives, who processed the scene recovered a firearm loaded with two rounds of ammunition and a Somali dagger. The men were also found to have worn multiple pairs of clothes, and detectives believe it is a new style being adopted by criminal gangs, to dispose of the outer clothing after fleeing the crime scenes, hence reducing the chances of being found.
