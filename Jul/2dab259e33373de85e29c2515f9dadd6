The Kisii county government is seeking to increase the production capacity of its oxygen plant to 1,100 litres per minute, Governor James Ongwae has said. The plant produces 300 litres per minute and the county is in the process of installing another one with the same capacity at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. “Covid-19 patients need up to 60 litres of oxygen per minute when other patients in ICU need between five and 15 litres per minute,” Ongwae said on Thursday afternoon. The governor said the county produces oxygen for its own consumption and neighbouring counties. He spoke in his office when he assented to the 2021-22 budget. In the budget, health and roads got the lion’s share. The health department was allocated Sh4.7 billion, while roads got Sh1.2 billion. “Since I took over as governor, my main focus has been improving health services. Health takes up to 40 per cent of our budget,” Ongwae said. The governor announced that the county will not open new roads in the current financial year. “Our focus will be murraming and improving existing ones,” Ongwae said. The devolved unit boss said the county did not allocate money for bursaries. Edited by A.N
