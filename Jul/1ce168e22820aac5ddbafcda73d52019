The 30th Miss World Kenya competition, set for next month, will be a reality TV show that will air live from Trade Mark Hotel. The show will have 14 episodes and the competition will broadcast live around the country. In honour of Wangari Maathaiâ€™s 10th death anniversary, the MWK Franchise has gone green. Terry Mungai, CEO of Ashleys Kenya Ltd and franchise director of the Mr and Miss World Kenya pageant, celebrated the eco-friendly focus. "Going green means embracing a way of life that enables us to conserve the environment by reducing, reusing and recycling items. We have committed to planting over 3,000 trees (1 for every student and staff within our organisation)," she said. Partners include Safaricom PLC, Shebesh Speaks, Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) and Coca Cola. Miss World Kenya 2021, rebranded #biggerandbetter, will feature women drawn from dozens of counties competing in multiple categories, including beauty with a purpose, swimsuit, talent, sports, top model and a new segment called 'Head to Head', culminating with reigning Miss World Kenya 2019 Maria Wavinya crowning her successor. Maria and Franklyn Asoyo, Mr World Kenya 2019, flagged off the new pageant and invited contestants to submit their applications to become the next Miss World Kenya 2021 via www.mrandmissworldkenya.com. The pageant is also excited to partner with Shebesh Speaks, a show on mental health hosted by Hon Rachel Shebesh, to raise awareness on mental health issues, advocate against social stigma and discuss ways to make mental health care in Kenya a reality. At this time, a minimal audience is being considered to abide by the Ministry of Health Covid -19 guidelines, and more information regarding tickets will be available by the end of July.
