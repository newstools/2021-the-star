Former South Mugirango MP Omingo Magara has insisted he is still the People's Democratic Party leader, dismissing a similar claim by Migori Governor Okoth Obado. Magara said he started the party on whose ticket Obado was elected as the first governor of Migori in the 2013 election. Speaking to the press, Magara said data from the Registrar of Political Parties shows that he is the first member and still the party leader. “How can a party leader run away from his own party? You can even go to the Registrar of Political Parties and check. I am still the party leader,” Magara said. Obado decamped to PDP again from ODM, which sponsored him for his second term in the last general election. He has claimed to be the party leader in several public forums, including a radio interview at Ramogi FM on Wednesday morning. But Magara refuted the claims, and said Obado came back as a strategic partner and “when he comes home back we will give him a serious position in the party as the first governor of the party.” “We are seriously talking about revamping the party and we have to call serious people like Obado. PDP is his natural home,” he said. He said the talks have been progressing well and “we have almost  agreed” to grow the party in South Nyanza. He said the PDP secretary general Charles Mogare is aware. “Maligning us that the party has been sold is far-fetched. We are in serious discussion,” Magara said. Magara said talk of party leadership and who will be in which position are used by political enemies to distract progress of the party, terming them as non-issues. During the radio interview, Obado said they will add more political voice to the people in Nyanza to ensure they work to get representation across all political seats in the next election. “In regions with many elected leaders in other parties, there are many people who get nominated to positions and don’t lose out when governments are formed. We will ensure this happens,” Obado said. Edited by Henry Makori
